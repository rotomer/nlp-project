(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and Counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Notes may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telefax confirmed in writing.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 will be delivered at the office of Counsel for the Underwriters, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, on the Closing Date.
 
7. . If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because of cancellation by the Representatives pursuant to Section 6 hereof, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any material agreement herein or comply with any material provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters in payment for the Notes on the Closing Date, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of Counsel for the Underwriters) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Notes.
Reimbursement of Expenses
 
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
Indemnification and Contribution
 
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein.
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with respect to claims and actions based upon written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and each Underwriter acknowledge that the statements set forth in the third paragraph, the second and third sentences in the sixth paragraph, the eighteenth paragraph, the nineteenth paragraph, the twentieth paragraph (under the subheading "UK Stabilisation") and the twenty-first paragraph (under the subheading "UK Stabilisation") of text under the heading "Underwriting" in the prospectus supplement to the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto).
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel); however, the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable
provided
however
 
fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel only if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded upon advice of counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 8 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise, or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(d) If the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and by the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company in connection with the purchase of the Notes hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding
Losses
 
the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus.
 
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that if the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Notes within 36 hours of such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except as otherwise provided in Section 11. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or to any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the applicable Notes, if prior to such time (i) there shall have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Notes, (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt

11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.

UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
TRANSFERS OF THIS SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF CEDE & CO. OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE.
 
 
 
 
This security (the "Security") is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001 and a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 (TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series. Any such additional Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or
906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $
(
DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the "Principal Amount") of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
 
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $
(
 DOLLARS) on February 15, 2014 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from November 17, 2003 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004, and at Maturity at the rate of 5.30% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the February 1 or August 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph. If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable
 
for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof. Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
 
Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar. Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity. If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.
 
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
 
New York, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts by check mailed to the registered Holders thereof; , , that at the option of the Holder, payment of interest may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Person entitled hereto as such account shall be provided to the Security Registrar and shall appear in the Security Register.

however
 
The Securities shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. The Redemption Price for the Securities to be redeemed shall equal the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date:
 
 
 
The Redemption Price shall be calculated by the Independent Investment Banker assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
 
 
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests represented hereby, and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
TRANSFERS OF THIS SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF CEDE & CO. OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE.
 
 
 
 
This security (the "Security") is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001 and a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 (TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series. Any such additional Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or
906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $
(
DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the "Principal Amount") of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
 
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $
(
DOLLARS) on February 15, 2006 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from November 17, 2003 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2004, and at Maturity at the rate of 2.75% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the February 1 or August 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph. If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable
 
for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof. Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
 
Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar. Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity. If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.
 
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the offices of JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
 
New York, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts by check mailed to the registered Holders thereof; , , that at the option of the Holder, payment of interest may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Person entitled hereto as such account shall be provided to the Security Registrar and shall appear in the Security Register.
