     JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 28, 2004  CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today reported first quarter net earnings of $30 million, or 14 cents per share, versus $99 million, or 46 cents per share, a year ago, including the favorable cumulative effect of a 2003 accounting change of $57 million after tax or 26 cents per share. First quarter 2004 included an after-tax charge of $37 million, or 17 cents per share, related to the Company's management restructuring initiatives. Excluding the restructuring charge, first quarter 2004 net earnings would have been $67 million, or 31 cents per share. Surface Transportation operating income, comprising the rail and intermodal units, was $151 million.
     Excluding the pre-tax restructuring charge of $53 million, first quarter 2004 Surface Transportation operating income was $204 million, compared to $169 million last year  a $35 million increase. The 21% increase in operating income was driven by record first quarter Surface Transportation revenue of $1.92 billion. Revenue gains were led by strong growth in most CSX markets, including a 10% rise in coal, coke and iron ore.
     "We are pleased by the record revenue growth in the first quarter delivered by our Surface Transportation units," said Michael J. Ward, CSX chairman and chief executive officer. "This effort reflects our success in both value pricing and business growth through modal conversions, new product offerings and the creation of new markets for rail service."
     Ward said that while he is pleased with the continued revenue growth, operating improvement and cost reductions must accelerate. "We plan to exceed historical-best operating levels through short-term efforts and, over the long term, the redesign of our network. The new operating initiatives and the leadership of our new chief operating officer, Tony Ingram, will drive significant improvement in our cost structure, service reliability and shareholder value."
     On a consolidated basis, revenues were $1.96 billion versus $2.02 billion a year ago. This comparison to prior year includes a $127 million revenue decrease, resulting from the conveyance of CSX Lines in February 2003, offset by Surface Transportation revenue growth of $82 million in the quarter.
     Looking forward, Ward said, "Combined with our own growth strategies, I see the strengthening economy and improved industrial production levels as terrific
 
opportunities to continue our record of revenue increases. At the same time, we'll be working to overcome continued service challenges and deliver consistent, continuous improvement in our operating and financial measures. Over time, this will allow CSX to better leverage the value of our system."

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
Merchandise
Merchandise again showed strong growth in the first quarter with revenue up 4 percent on volume growth of 3 percent. All markets showed year-over-year improvements in revenue.
Automotive
Revenue and volume results were unfavorable year over year. Despite a 4 percent increase in vehicle sales year over year, inventories remain high with production flat. Several CSXT-served assembly plants were down for inventory adjustments. Plant closure and industry strikes also negatively impacted performance. Aggressive new vehicle incentives weakened the remarketed vehicle market.
Coal, Coke and Iron Ore
Coal, coke and iron ore experienced 10 percent revenue growth on 9 percent volume growth, primarily due to strength in export, river and southern utilities markets. Strength in export resulted from continued high European steam coal demand and increased demand from Asia. Pricing and modal conversions also contributed to gains. All lines of business experienced favorable year-over-year gains except northern utilities.
Other
Other revenue for 2004 includes $14 million for Four Rivers Transportation ("FRT"), a short-line railroad consolidated in 2004 pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46. Prior to 2004, FRT was accounted for under the equity method.
Intermodal
 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
(continued)
expenses increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2004 versus the prior year. The effects of inflation continue to drive labor and fringe expense increases, along with increases in pension and incentive compensation expense of $10 million and a $4 million increase resulting from the consolidation of FRT. These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $27 million period over period, primarily due to volume and inflation related expenses as well as an increase in expenses related to derailments, property and sales taxes of $6 million and consolidation of FRT of $5 million.
Materials, Supplies and Other
decreased $2 million primarily due to $6 million in recoveries and settlements offset by unfavorable mix, volume and utilization.
Building and Equipment Rent
expenses increased $7 million due to an increase in depreciable base partially offset by revised depreciation rates resulting from the Company's life study completed in the third quarter of 2003.
Depreciation
expenses decreased $4 million in the first quarter of 2004 as compared to 2003. Favorable developments in fuel prices during the three-month period ended March 26, 2004, versus the comparable period in 2003, were offset by an $11 million increase due to volume and efficiency issues. Additionally, fuel expenses were favorably affected by $8 million of recoveries associated with foreign line fuel billing disputes.
Fuel
of $53 million represents the current charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003 at Surface Transportation.

OPERATING RESULTS
Revenue decreased $8 million to $48 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared to $56 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to the loss of a significant customer at its Hong Kong operations.
Expense increased $5 million to $46 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared to $41 million in the prior quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million restructuring charges recorded related to initiatives to maintain and improve productivity standards in light of current business conditions.
Operating income decreased $13 million for the first quarter of 2004, as compared to the prior quarter.
