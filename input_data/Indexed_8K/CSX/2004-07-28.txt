     , Fla., July 28, 2004  CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2004.
JACKSONVILLE
     Michael J. Ward, CSX chairman and chief executive officer said, "This is the third quarter in a row that we've delivered record setting Surface Transportation revenue, reflecting strong economic growth and high transportation demand.
     "We are taking actions to improve our service and deliver more to the bottom line. Our management restructuring and organizational streamlining is now complete. We're adding operating resources to meet continued, expected demand. Our network redesign is underway to improve efficiency and reduce car miles and terminal handlings. Together, these efforts will improve the productivity of our operations, while generating the service our customers deserve and the financial results each of us expect."
     For the second quarter, CSX reported net earnings of $119 million, or 55 cents per share, versus $127 million, or 59 cents per share in 2003. The second quarter of 2004 included an after-tax charge of $9 million, or 5 cents per share, related to the Company's management restructuring initiatives. Excluding the current restructuring charge, second quarter 2004 net earnings would have been $128 million, or 60 cents per share.
     Surface Transportation operating income was $280 million, up $21 million from the prior year quarter. Surface Transportation revenue of $1.99 billion drove the increase in operating income. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue was $2.03 billion versus $1.94 billion a year ago.
     Ward added, "Looking ahead, we expect to see continued strong volumes across most of our markets, in line with economic growth projections for the balance of the year.
 
"In addition, the company's continued roll out of our new operating plan will drive improvement in our service quality and an increase in capacity through increased asset utilization and improved network fluidity."

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
(a) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was issued in 2001. In conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. With the adoption of SFAS 143 in fiscal year 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million after tax, or 26 cents per share, as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter, representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings.
     
(b) In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC ("CSX Lines"), to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million (gross cash proceeds of approximately $240 million, $214 million net of transaction costs, and $60 million of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently renamed Horizon Lines LLC ("Horizon"). A deferred pretax gain of approximately $127 million as a result of the transaction will be recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. Horizon subleased equipment from certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial obligations related to $300 million of vessel and equipment leases under which CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee or guarantor. During the third quarter of 2003, CSX received a $15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included $3 million of interest, in return for a portion of its investment in Horizon. On July 7, 2004, Horizon completed a merger with a third party, and CSX received $59 million, which included $52 million for the purchase of its ownership interest in Horizon and a performance payment of $7 million. However, CSX or one of its affiliates will continue to remain a lessee or guarantor on certain vessels and equipment as long as the subleases remain in effect.
     
(c) In the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $15 million pretax, $9 million after tax, 5 cents per share, for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003 at Surface Transportation. The six months ended June 25, 2004, include restructuring charges at Surface Transportation and International Terminals of $74 million pretax, $46 million after tax, 22 cents per share.
     
(d) In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Therefore, the Company consolidated Four Rivers Transportation ("FRT"), a short-line railroad, which was previously accounted for under the equity method. The second quarter of 2004 includes revenues, operating expenses and after-tax income of approximately $16 million, $8 million and $2 million for FRT, respectively. The six months ended June 25, 2004, include revenues, operating expenses, and after-tax income of approximately $30 million, $18 million, and $3 million, respectively. The quarter and six months ended June 27, 2003, includes net equity earnings of FRT of approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, (included in other income).

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION TRAFFIC AND REVENUE
(a)
Loads (Thousands); Revenue (Dollars in Millions)
 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
Merchandise showed strong growth in the second quarter with revenue up 7% on 4% volume growth. All markets showed year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Merchandise
Light vehicle production is flat year over year. Inventory levels remain high at 72 days for all manufacturers, 85 days for the Big 3. Several CSXT served assembly plants were down for inventory adjustments.
Automotive
Coal, coke, and iron ore experienced 6% revenue growth on 2% volume growth. This was driven by significant volume and revenue gains in export, river, lake and industrial markets. All lines of business reflect favorable year-over-year revenue per car gains.
Coal, Coke and Iron Ore
Other revenue for 2004 includes $16 million for FRT, a short-line railroad consolidated in 2004 pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46. Prior to 2004, FRT was accounted for under the equity method.
Other
Intermodal
 
SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
(continued)
expenses increased $10 million during the second quarter of 2004 versus the prior year comparable quarter. The effects of inflation and challenged operations continue to drive labor and fringe expense increases, along with increases in pension and incentive compensation expense of $9 million and the $4 million increase resulting from the consolidation of FRT. These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $45 million for the quarter ended June 25, 2004 versus the quarter ended June 27, 2003, primarily due to increased maintenance and crew travel costs of $17 million, property and sales taxes of $9 million due to a favorable settlement in the prior year and the consolidation of FRT of $3 million.
Materials, Supplies and Other
decreased $5 million during the second quarter of 2004 versus the prior year comparable quarter, principally due to unfavorable casualty and other reserve adjustments recorded in 2003.
Conrail Rents, Fees and Services
increased $13 million for the quarter ended June 25, 2004 versus the quarter ended June 27, 2003, as a result of unfavorable mix, volume and asset utilization.
Building and Equipment Rent
decreased $7 million during the second quarter of 2004 versus the prior year comparable quarter attributable to reduced volume on Intermodal's western network.
Inland Transportation
expenses increased $15 million for the quarter ended June 25, 2004 versus the quarter ended June 27, 2003. Higher fuel prices, net of hedging benefits, during the second quarter were compounded by volume and efficiency issues. However, fuel expenses were favorably affected by $8 million of recoveries associated with foreign line fuel billing settlements.
Fuel
of $15 million for the quarter ended June 25, 2004 represents the current charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003.

OPERATING RESULTS
Revenue decreased $16 million to $38 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $54 million in the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to the loss of a significant customer at its Hong Kong operations.
Expense decreased $5 million to $32 million for the second quarter of 2004, compared to $37 million in the second quarter of 2003, primarily attributable to the lower customer volume in Hong Kong.
Operating income decreased $11 million for the second quarter of 2004, as compared to the second quarter of 2003.
