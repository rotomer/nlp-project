          , Fla., January 25, 2005  CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004.
JACKSONVILLE
          CSX's core Surface Transportation businesses produced operating income of $315 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $239 million in the previous year's quarter. The fourth quarter of 2004 included a $7 million positive impact from an extra week that resulted from the company's 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. The 2003 quarter contained a net charge for management's restructuring initiative of $12 million. On a comparable basis, Surface Transportation operating income for 2004 would have been $308 million, representing a 23% improvement over 2003.
          "CSX's earnings were driven by the continued strength in the economy and by improving operations," said Michael J. Ward, CSX Corporation chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Notably, this quarter represents the fourth straight quarter in which CSX has delivered consistent, continuous improvement in core earnings."
          Surface Transportation revenue for the quarter was $2.17 billion including $117 million from the 53 accounting week. On an adjusted 52-week basis, revenue for the quarter was up 8% led by strength in the company's merchandise, coal and intermodal markets.
rd
          Ward added, "The continued growth in revenue was due in large part to the ongoing success in the company's yield initiatives and represents the 11 consecutive quarter of solid revenue growth. Long-term, CSX's success is dependant on its ability to drive further improvements in operations for its customers. In the fourth quarter, the rail network showed signs of improving fluidity as the company worked to fine-tune the new operating plan that was put in place during the third quarter. The leadership of CSX remains optimistic about the operating plan and the opportunity it holds for the company going forward."
th
          In the fourth quarter of 2004, CSX entered into a definitive agreement to sell its international terminals business for $1.15 billion in cash and other consideration. Amounts related to this business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result of this agreement, the company recorded additional tax expense in the quarter of $97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings.
 
          Commenting on the CSX World Terminals transaction, Ward said, "The company expects to close on this transaction in the first quarter of this year allowing CSX to even further sharpen its focus on core Surface Transportation businesses."
          CSX's detailed financial information is contained in the company's Quarterly Flash document, which will be posted on the company's website, , and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and 2004 includes 53 weeks, with the extra week in the fourth quarter. In the following discussion of quarterly comparisons, the two periods are compared as if they were of equal duration.
Merchandise showed strong yield improvement in the fourth quarter. On a 52-week basis, revenue was up 9% while volume remained flat. All markets showed year-over-year improvement in revenue-per-car due to continued yield management strategies and the company's fuel surcharge program.
Merchandise
Automotive
Overall North American light vehicle production increased by appoximately 3%, year over year. Inventory levels remain high at 66 days for most manufacturers and 78 days for the Big 3. Downtime and reduced production at CSX served plants negatively impacted growth.
Coal, Coke and Iron Ore
Coal, coke and iron ore experienced significant volume and revenue gains in export, metallurgical and utility north markets. All lines of business reflect favorable year-over-year revenue-per-car gains. Lake and river market volumes were negatively impacted by producer decisions to send tonnage to other markets.

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION OPERATING RESULTS
(continued)
CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and 2004 includes 53 weeks, with the extra week in the fourth quarter. In the following discussion of quarterly comparisons, the two periods are compared as if they were of equal duration.
expenses increased $32 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the prior year comparable quarter. This increase is attributable to the effects of inflation, along with increases in the Company's incentive compensation plan. These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $43 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the prior year comparable quarter. The increase is mostly related to higher spending on track, locomotives, car repair and other items.
Materials, Supplies and Other
decreased $59 million for the quarter primarily due to the Conrail spin-off transaction completed in third quarter of 2004. This transaction decreased rents paid to Conrail as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSX.
Conrail Rents, Fees and Services
increased $55 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 due to an increased depreciation base, mainly attributable to the Conrail spin-off transaction, as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSX.
Depreciation
increased $41 million for the quarter versus the prior year due to higher fuel prices, net of hedging benefits.
