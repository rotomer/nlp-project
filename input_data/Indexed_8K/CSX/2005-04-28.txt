JACKSONVILLE
     CSX's core Surface Transportation businesses produced record operating income, driven by a 10 percent increase in revenue and better cost discipline. On a comparable basis, adjusting for the 2004 management restructuring charge, Surface Transportation operating income for 2005 increased $147 million, or 72 percent, year over year. CSX's operating ratio for the quarter was 83.3 percent, an improvement of more than 6 points versus the first quarter of 2004.
     "We are very pleased with the 72 percent year-over-year increase in operating income that the employees of CSX produced in the first quarter," said Michael Ward, CSX Corporation chairman, president and chief executive officer. "CSX continued on its path of consistent, continuous improvement producing year-over-year growth in core earnings for the fifth consecutive quarter."
     Surface Transportation revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion versus $1.9 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue gains in the quarter were led by strength in the Company's coal and merchandise markets, which produced 20 percent and 8 percent year-over-year revenue gains, respectively.
     Ward added, "A strong pricing environment resulting from high demand contributed significantly to the Company's year-over-year revenue growth with CSX's value pricing and yield management initiatives, along with the fuel surcharge program, driving the top line improvements.
 
     "The Company remains focused on continuing to drive improvements in its operational and safety performance, sustaining its top line performance by pricing our service to market levels, and improving our bottom line performance through better cost discipline," said Ward.
     Also in the first quarter of 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals business for cash consideration of $1.142 billion, subject to final working capital and long-term debt adjustments that have not yet been determined. CSX recognized an after-tax net gain of $425 million as a result of the sale, including a loss on operations for the quarter.
     CSX's detailed financial information is contained in the Company's Quarterly Flash document, which will be posted on the Company's website, , and filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

Merchandise revenue was up 8% on relatively flat volume during the first quarter of 2005. All markets showed year-over-year improvement in revenue per car due to continued price increases and the Company's fuel surcharge program.
Merchandise
Revenue increased 3% on flat volume as a result of yield improvements. North American light vehicle production decreased 179,285 units, or roughly 4%, year over year. Inventory levels remain high, at 69 days for most manufacturers and 79 days for the Big 3. Manufacturers are using production downtime and incentives to address excess inventory.
Automotive
Overall coal, coke and iron ore revenues were favorable 20% year over year. Volume was favorable 9% or 38,000 carloads. Growth was driven by volume gains in export, industrial, coke, and utility north markets. Revenue per car growth was the result of market price increases and the Company's fuel surcharge program offsetting slightly unfavorable mix. All lines of business reflect favorable year-over-year revenue-per-car gains.
Coal, Coke and Iron Ore
Intermodal
 
expenses increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2005 versus the prior year quarter. The effects of inflation continue to drive labor and fringe expense increases, along with increases in incentive compensation. These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $46 million during the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the prior year quarter. The increase is associated with volume and inflation related expenses as well as an increase in expenses related to the resolution of certain legal matters and higher reserve requirements for uncollectible accounts.
Materials, Supplies and Other
increased $43 million for the first quarter of 2005 due to an increased depreciation base, mainly attributable to the Conrail spin-off transaction, as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSX.
Depreciation
increased $25 million for the quarter versus the prior year due to higher fuel prices, net of hedging benefits.
Fuel
decreased $18 million primarily due to decreased Intermodal volume on the western network.
Inland Transportation
decreased $67 million for the quarter primarily due to the Conrail spin-off transaction completed in the third quarter of 2004. This transaction decreased rents paid to Conrail, as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSX.
Conrail Rents, Fees and Services
of $53 million represents the 2004 charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003 at Surface Transportation.
