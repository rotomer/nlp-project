JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
, June 15, 2005- CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) announced today the results of its previously announced tender offers for up to $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the notes listed below and in the manner described below. The offers commenced on May 17, 2005, and expired at 12:00 midnight on June 14, 2005. $1,349,736,000 of outstanding notes have been tendered and not withdrawn through the expiration date.
 
With the successful completion of this transaction, CSXs debt has been reduced by $1 billion, said Oscar Munoz, CSXs Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The transaction, which was net present value positive, immediately enhances the companys credit profile and reduces ongoing interest costs.
 
The offers were presented in two separate smaller offers - one that covered three series of notes listed below that mature in 2006 (the 2006 Notes Offer) and one that covered nine series of notes listed below, each of which matures in or after 2017 (the Long-Term Notes Offer). The aggregate principal amount of notes that will be purchased in the 2006 Notes Offer will not exceed $450,000,000, and the aggregate principal amount of notes that will be purchased in the Long Term-Notes Offer will not exceed $550,002,000. Because the aggregate principal amount of notes tendered exceeds these caps, CSX will accept notes purchased based on the priority level set forth below in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase.
 
The following table provides the tender offer results as of 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on the expiration date, for each series:
 
 
 
 
 
The company will accept tendered CSX Floating Rate Notes and CSX 7.90% Notes based on the proration procedure set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The proration factor with respect to the CSX Floating Rate Notes will be 22.68% and the proration factor with respect to the CSX 7.90% Notes will be 8.23%. No CSXT 7.875% Notes, CSX 6.80% Notes, CSX 8.30% Notes or CSXT 9.75% Notes will be accepted for purchase. Notes not accepted for purchase will be promptly returned to the tendering holder (or, if tendered through DTC, will be promptly credited to the relevant account at DTC, in accordance with DTCs procedures).
