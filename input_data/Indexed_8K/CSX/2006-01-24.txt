CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and 2004 included 53 weeks, with the additional week in the 2004 fourth quarter. In the following discussion of quarterly comparisons, the two periods are compared as if they were of equal duration.
Rail Operating Revenue
Fourth quarter 2005 results represent the 15 consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth as well as record revenue-per-unit results. All four major markets experienced revenue and revenue-per-unit gains as a result of continued traffic re-pricing and the fuel surcharge program.
th
Merchandise
 Volume declined as a result of plant closures or curtailments during the quarter that reduced shipments. The absence of lower yield shipments combined with an increase in long-haul traffic led to a 22% improvement in revenue per unit.
Phosphate and Fertilizer
 Overall domestic and international demand for steel transportation remained strong throughout the quarter. Pricing increases coupled with asset allocation towards higher margin and longer haul traffic limited volume growth but resulted in revenue-per-unit increases of 19%.
Metals
 Volume was unfavorable due to reduced demand in both lumber and panel products as the housing outlook continues to weaken and housing starts are expected to decline. Sustained conversion to electronic media and the use of lighter papers continues to reduce the demand for newsprint paper. Efforts to increase price and fuel surcharge coverage continue across all lines of business, impacting volume in some markets.
Forest Products
 Volume in this segment, which includes the transportation of refrigerated products, canned goods, and building products, was unfavorable due to the cyclical nature of hurricane recovery efforts, particularly for bricks, wallboard and roofing shingle building materials, compared to the prior year.
Food and Consumer
 Volume during the fourth quarter was up 2% based on strength of the soybean harvest. Ethanol shipments also experienced strong growth in the quarter due to a continued shift by several states to use ethanol as a fuel additive. Volumes in other markets such as feed grain, wheat, sweeteners, oils and flour were flat.
Agricultural Products
 Volume was unfavorable due to continued high raw materials inventories and energy prices. Several chemical plants along the Mississippi coast continued to be negatively impacted by Hurricane Katrina.
Chemicals
 Volume and revenue were unfavorable primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina and lower military shipments. Lower volumes in auto shredder residue, due to increased prices and truck competition, were offset by growth in shipments of municipal and construction waste.
Emerging Markets
Automotive
Volume was down 4% as assembly plant closures and diversions to truck more than offset increases in North American light vehicle production. Revenue per unit increased by 7% due to both price and fuel surcharge increases.
Coal, Coke and Iron Ore
Revenue was up 15% and volume was up 3% on strong demand across all markets. Growth was strongest in the utility market where electricity generation was up 4% in CSX-served markets. Additionally, utility inventories remain below target levels, continuing the increased demand for coal transportation. Smaller markets such as integrated steel and industrial markets also experienced growth.
Intermodal
 Domestic shipments representing approximately 44% of Intermodal volumes were down primarily due to continued focus on longer hauls in higher density lanes and sustained strength in pricing. Strong demand in the parcel section offset volume declines in other markets and drove revenue increases.
Domestic
Both volumes and revenue decreased due to a reduction in long-haul shipments from the west coast. The shift of traffic to east coast ports caused an increase in shorter-haul moves, which negatively impacted revenue per unit. Favorable pricing conditions offset the loss of long-haul revenue, and resulted in a modest increase in revenue per unit. A continued focus on network operations designed to increase efficiencies and reduce indirect routing unfavorably impacted volume.
International 
Higher fuel surcharge rates and continued emphasis on ancillary revenues, including terminal storage charges and container reservation fees drove increases of 46%.

expenses increased $55 million. Higher incentive compensation costs, inflation and increased staffing are the primary drivers of the change in labor and fringe expense.
Labor and Fringe
expenses decreased $38 million. The primary drivers are net favorable casualty reserve adjustments related to decreasing claim trends and less derailment related costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense resulting from environmental remediation costs and other items.
Materials, Supplies and Other
increased $3 million, which is attributable to an increase in the asset base.
Depreciation
increased $59 million due to higher fuel costs, net of hedging benefits.
Fuel
decreased $12 million due to a reduction in railcar lease expense, which is associated with volume, and lower locomotive lease expense.
Building and Equipment Rent
decreased $11 million primarily due to lower Intermodal volume related to purchased transportation services from other railroads.
Inland Transportation
decreased $7 million due to lower fees charged by Conrail and other items related to CSX's ownership in Conrail.
