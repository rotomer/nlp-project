Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 3, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation ("CSX") approved and adopted the CSX 2006-2007 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2006-2007 LTIP") and the CSX 2006-2008 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2006-2008 LTIP"), subject to shareholder reapproval of the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan ("COIP"). The shareholders of CSX reapproved the COIP on May 3, 2006.
     The 2006-2007 LTIP and 2006-2008 LTIP (the "Plans"), which were adopted under the COIP, establish certain performance goals and award opportunities for certain CSX employees. The Plans seek to motivate and reward certain CSX employees through the issuance of Performance Grants pursuant to which payouts are made based on CSX's attainment of a lower Operating Ratio. CSX's Operating Ratio is defined as annual surface transportation operating expenses divided by surface transportation revenue of CSX's rail and intermodal businesses and is calculated excluding non-recurring items. The Operating Ratio targets that determine payouts also vary based on the average cost of oil. Payouts of Performance Grants will be in the form of CSX common stock.
     Payouts of Performance Grants to named executive officers are determined using the same Operating Ratio targets, subject to adjustment based on an additional performance measure, earnings per share excluding non-recurring items, and the achievement of certain strategic initiatives.
     The Plans are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On May 3, 2006, the shareholders of CSX approved certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of CSX that add new articles that provide that any action on a matter involving the following items shall require the approval, by the affirmative vote, of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast thereon:
     (a) Any plan of merger or share exchange for which the Virginia Stock Corporation Act ("VSCA") requires shareholder approval;
     (b) Disposition of assets of CSX for which the VSCA requires shareholder approval;
     (c) The dissolution of CSX; and
     (d) An affiliated transaction under the VSCA with interested shareholders, defined as those beneficially owning more than 10% of any class of the outstanding voting shares of CSX.
     A copy of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3(i).

Exhibit 3(i)
          The name of the Corporation is "CSX Corporation".
          The purpose for which the Corporation is organized is to transact any lawful business not required to be specifically stated in the Articles of Incorporation.
          3.1 . The Corporation shall have authority to issue three hundred million (300,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, and twenty-five million (25,000,000) shares of Serial Preferred Stock, without par value.
Number and Designation
          3.2 . No holder of capital stock of the Corporation of any class shall have any preemptive right to subscribe to or purchase (i) any shares of capital stock of this Corporation, (ii) any securities convertible into such shares or (iii) any options, warrants or rights to purchase such shares or securities convertible into any such shares.
Preemptive Rights
          4.1 . The Board of Directors is hereby empowered by the adoption of an amendment to these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to cause the Serial Preferred Stock of the Corporation to be issued in series with such of the variations permitted by clauses (a)-(h), both inclusive, of this Section 4.1 as shall have been fixed and determined by the Board of Directors with respect to any series prior to the issue of any shares of such series.
Issuance in Series
 
The shares of the Serial Preferred Stock of different series may vary as to:
          (a) the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series, which shall be such as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes;
          (b) the rate of dividend, the time of payment and, if cumulative, the dates from which dividends shall be cumulative, and the extent of participation rights, if any;
          (c) any right to vote with holders of shares of any other series or class and any right to vote as a class, either generally or as a condition to specified corporate action;
          (d) the price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be redeemed;
          (e) the amount payable upon shares in event of involuntary liquidation;
          (f) the amount payable upon shares in event of voluntary liquidation;
          (g) any sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of shares; and
          (h) the terms and conditions on which shares may be converted, if the shares of any series are issued with the privilege of conversion.
          The shares of all series of Serial Preferred Stock shall be identical except as, within the limits set forth above in this Section 4.1, shall have been fixed and determined by the Board of Directors prior to the issuance thereof.
          4.2 . The holders of the Serial Preferred Stock of each series shall be entitled to receive, if and when declared payable by the Board of Directors, dividends in lawful money of the United States of America, at the dividend rate for such series, and not exceeding such rate except to the extent of any participation right. Such dividends shall be payable on such dates as shall be fixed for such series. Dividends, if cumulative and in arrears, shall not bear interest.
Dividends
          No dividends shall be declared or paid upon or set apart for the Common Stock or for stock of any other class hereafter created ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Stock in respect of dividends or assets (hereinafter called Junior Stock), and no shares of Serial Preferred Stock, Common Stock or Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise reacquired for a consideration, nor shall any funds be set aside for or paid to any sinking fund therefor, unless and until (i) full dividends on the outstanding Serial Preferred Stock at the dividend rate or rates therefor, together with the full additional amount required by any participation right, shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment with respect to all past dividend periods, to the extent that the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends with respect to any past dividend period, and the current dividend period, and (ii) all mandatory sinking fund payments that shall have become due in respect of any series of the Serial Preferred Stock shall have been made. Unless full dividends with respect to all past dividend periods on the outstanding Serial Preferred Stock at the dividend rate or rates therefor, to the extent the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends with respect to any particular past dividend period, together with the full additional amount required by any participation right, shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment and all mandatory sinking fund payments that shall have become due in respect of any series of the Serial Preferred Stock shall have been made, no distributions shall be made to the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock of
 
any series unless distributions are made to the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock of all series then outstanding in proportion to the aggregate amounts of the deficiencies in payments due to the respective series, and all payments shall be applied, first, to dividends accrued and in arrears, next, to any amount required by any participation right, and, finally, to mandatory sinking fund payments. The terms "current dividend period" and "past dividend period" mean, if two or more series of Serial Preferred Stock having different dividend periods are at the time outstanding, the current dividend period or any past dividend period, as the case may be, with respect to each such series.
          4.3 . In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock of each series shall be entitled to receive, for each share thereof, the fixed liquidation price for such series, plus, in case such liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall have been voluntary, the fixed liquidation premium for such series, if any, together in all cases with a sum equal to all dividends accrued or in arrears thereon and the full additional amount required by any participation right, before any distribution of the assets shall be made to holders of the Common Stock or Junior Stock; but the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock shall be entitled to no further participation in such distribution. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the assets distributable among the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts aforesaid, then such assets shall be distributed among the holders of the Serial Preferred Stock then outstanding ratably in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are respectively entitled. For the purposes of this Section 4.3, the expression "dividends accrued or in arrears" means, in respect of each share of the Serial Preferred Stock of any series at a particular time, an amount equal to the product of the rate of dividend per annum applicable to the shares of such series multiplied by the number of years and any fractional part of a year that shall have elapsed from the date when dividends on such shares became cumulative to the particular time in question less the total amount of dividends actually paid on the shares of such series or declared and set apart for payment thereon; , , that, if the dividends on such shares shall not be fully cumulative, such expression shall mean the dividends, if any, cumulative in respect of such shares for the period stated in the articles of serial designation creating such shares less all dividends paid in or with respect to such period.

Limit on Liability
     7.3 . The Corporation shall indemnify any individual who is, was or is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding (including a proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation) because such individual is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or because such individual is or was serving the Corporation or any other legal entity in any capacity at the request of the Corporation, against all liabilities and reasonable expenses incurred in the proceeding except such liabilities and expenses as are incurred because of such individual's willful misconduct or knowing violation of the criminal law.

Exhibit 10.1
Effective Date and Term
The CSX 20062007 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "20062007 LTIP" or the "Plan"), effective May 4, 2006 (the "Effective Date"), is the vehicle pursuant to which CSX awards Performance Grants ("Performance Grant or Grants," as described in Section 8 of the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan (as reapproved by CSX's shareholders May 3, 2006)). The 20062007 LTIP Cycle (the "20062007 Cycle") commences on the Effective Date and ends December 28, 2007.
Purpose and Objective
The purpose of the 20062007 LTIP is to reward eligible employees for their contribution to the attainment of a lower Operating Ratio which is intended to result in CSX Corporation ("CSX") share price appreciation. Performance Grants are issued based on an employee's job position, accountability, and the potential to impact CSX's financial results.
The Plan seeks to motivate and reward employees through the issuance of Performance Grants pursuant to which payouts are made based on CSX's 2007 Operating Ratio ("Operating Ratio"). Payouts of Performance Grants will be in the form of CSX common stock.
Eligibility and Participation
Active employees of CSX or a participating affiliate (collectively, the "Companies") in Salary Band 06 and above as of the Effective Date shall participate in the 20062007 LTIP ("Participants") and shall receive Performance Grants in accordance with the Performance Grant schedule approved by the Compensation Committee of CSX's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"). Salary band levels ("Bands") are determined by the CSX Compensation and Benefits Department. The Performance Grant schedule will be maintained in the office of the Plan Administrator.
Employees hired or promoted, into Band 06 and above after the Effective Date and before the end of the 20062007 Cycle, will receive a pro-rata allocation of Performance Grants based on their participation (and status as full time or part-time). Participants who are moved to a higher or lower Band during the Cycle will receive a pro-rata allocation of Performance Grants pertaining to each applicable Band based upon the number of months of participation in each Band relative to the number of months in the Cycle. The same pro-rata method will be used for employees who transfer between union and non-union employment. For purposes of the pro-rata calculation, participation begins on the 1 day of the month following the date the Participant was hired, promoted, or transferred. Notwithstanding the preceding, any Participant who is hired at or promoted to a salary level making such Participant a "covered employee" under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) must have had a period of service of at least 3 months to qualify for a Performance Grant at that level. In such cases, the pro-rata calculation shall be made as of the date of hire/promotion.
st
Plan Design
The 20062007 LTIP provides for the issuance of Performance Grants, as approved by the Compensation Committee, based upon the dollar amount of the award approved for each Band level or position. The number of performance units received is based on the dollar amount of the Performance Grant issued to each Band or position divided by $65the approximate average price per share for April 2006with minor upward rounding.
 
As shown in the Performance Measure Table in Exhibit Aawards are paid out as a percentage of a Participant's Performance Grant units based upon the applicable CSX 2007 Operating Ratio.
,
1. Operating Ratio
Operating Ratio is the single performance measure. Operating Ratio is defined as annual surface transportation operating expenses divided by surface transportation revenue of CSX's rail and intermodal businesses. Operating Ratio is calculated excluding non-recurring items disclosed in the financial statements. Using this measure to determine payout levels reinforces the correlation between an improving operating ratio and an increasing stock price. Efforts to improve the Operating Ratio aligns CSX's business objectives in a line-of-sight way that allows individuals to equate personal actions to desired performance outcomes. Each Plan Participant should be motivated to grow revenue, reduce expense, improve service, increase productivity, improve safety, and increase asset utilization/rationalization.
As the price of oil has a significant impact on the Operating Ratio but not necessarily operating income because of CSX's ability to pass a portion of the cost of oil on to customers, the Operating Ratio targets vary based on the average cost of oil per barrel outside the "collar" for 2007. The chart in Exhibit A reflects the Operating Ratio targets and related payouts at various WTI/Barrel prices of oil and provides a payout example. Operating Ratios will be interpolated based on differences between the actual average WTI/Barrel for 2007 and the prices in the chart.
2. Taxation of Awards
2006-2007 LTIP Awards will be paid in shares of CSX common stock. The value received by the Participant is taxable income, so CSX is required to withhold income and employment taxes at the time the awards are paid. Thus, CSX will withhold from stock awards a number of shares equal in value to the minimum required employment tax and income tax withholding; no additional shares may be withheld. Fractional shares will be paid in cash. The following is an example of the withholding calculation:
Example:
Participants may defer receipt of awards under the CSX Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.
No Performance Grant is considered earned under the Plan until the Compensation Committee approves the payout thereof.
Plan Administration
The Senior Vice President  Human Resources of CSX shall be the Plan Administrator and shall interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan subject to the terms of the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan and the Compensation Committee's authority and responsibility under the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Award Payouts
As noted above, all Performance Grants will be paid in CSX stock. Fractional shares will be paid in cash.
2
 
Awards will be paid only to Participants who are actively employed by the Companies on the date of payout for the 20062007 LTIP. Except as provided below, all other Participants whose employment terminates prior to the payout date shall forfeit any and all awards under the 20062007 LTIP.
A Participant, whose employment terminates due to death, disability, or retirement, shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata payout under the LTIP. Participants whose hours are reduced so that they are no longer full time active employees during the Cycle, as a result of a phased retirement or similar program at the request of or with the consent of CSX, shall be entitled to a pro-rata award to the date of such change and a pro-rata reduced award for the remaining portion of such Cycle they work based on their reduced hours. All awards will be payable no later than the March 15 following the end of the Cycle. Retirement means an employee who retires under the CSX Pension Pan or the Special Retirement Plan for CSX Corporation and Affiliated Companies.
A Participant who commits an act involving moral turpitude that adversely affects the reputation or business of the Companies shall forfeit any award earned under the 2006-2007 LTIP. Examples of acts of moral turpitude include, dishonesty or fraud involving the Companies, their employees, vendors or customers and violations of CSX's Code of Ethics.
Plan Amendments and Termination
Consistent with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to terminate, adjust, amend, or suspend the Plan at any time and at its sole discretion.
CSX Executive Team
The additional financial performance measure of "earnings per share" shall apply to the CSX Executive Team ("E-Team"). The table in Exhibit B sets forth adjustments to the payout earned based on the Operating Ratio achieved at the applicable WTI/Barrel price of oil as set forth in the table in Exhibit A. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may reduce any payout otherwise earned by an E-Team Participant by up to 30% based upon certain of CSX's strategic initiatives set forth in Exhibit B.
1
Except as provided above, the 20062007 LTIP will be administered for E-Team Participants in the same manner as for other Plan Participants.
Miscellaneous
The adoption of the 20062007 LTIP does not imply any commitment to continue the same or any long term incentive compensation plan for any succeeding year or period. Neither the Plan nor any Performance Grant made or payment under the Plan shall create any employment contract or relationship between the Companies and any Participant.

Exhibit B
Exhibit B contains specific quantitative or qualitative performance related-factors, or factors or criteria involving confidential commercial or business information, the disclosure of which would have an adverse effect on CSX.
