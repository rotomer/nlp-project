(July 18, 2006)  CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported second quarter 2006 net earnings of $390 million, or $1.66 per share. Earnings for the second quarter included insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and benefits associated with the resolution of tax matters with a combined impact of $0.50 per share. Last year's second quarter earnings were $165 million, or $0.73 per share, which included costs related to a debt repurchase of $0.54 per share, partially offset by a state income tax benefit of $0.31 per share. On a comparable basis, the company's earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 were $1.16, a 21 percent increase, compared to $0.96 for the same period last year. (See table below for reconciliation of all items to reported numbers.)

"These financial gains are a result of momentum in our operations, improvements in productivity and service, and our ability to capture price in a strong market environment," said Michael J. Ward, chairman and chief executive officer of CSX Corporation. "Our strategy remains on track, the team is driving performance, and we are well positioned for profitable growth."
The company posted record Surface Transportation revenues of $2.4 billion, which represented a 12 percent increase from the second quarter last year.

On a comparable basis, 2006 second quarter operating income was a record $519 million, a 23 percent increase over last year, and reflected an operating ratio of 78.6 percent.
In addition, the company announced its board of directors has approved a 2-for-1 stock split for shareholders and a $0.10 quarterly dividend on the post-split shares, representing a 54% increase. The board also authorized a $500 million share buyback program that the company intends to complete over the next 12 months.
"We are confident in our ability to achieve double digit growth in operating income, earnings and free cash flow over the next five years," said Ward. "The decision by our board to split our stock, increase the dividend and authorize the share buyback program reflects our strong balance sheet, and follows record operating performance as well as new investments to expand network capacity."
The stock split will be for all shareholders of record on August 3, 2006 with a distribution date of August 15, 2006.
The $0.10 post-split quarterly dividend on the company's common stock to shareholders of record as of August 25, 2006, is payable on September 15, 2006.
The new share buyback program is authorized to begin on July 24, 2006. Under the program, the company may purchase shares from time to time on the open market, through block trades or otherwise.

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
In the second quarter of 2006, CSX recognized a gain of $126 million before tax, or $78 million after tax, on insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina. The gain represents insurance recoveries related to property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
 
 
 
 
In the second quarter of 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of outstanding debt. CSX recognized $192 million of before-tax costs, or $123 million of after-tax costs, to repurchase the debt, which primarily reflects the increase in current market value above original issue value.
 
In the first quarter of 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals business for net cash proceeds of $998 million. As a result, CSX recognized earnings from discontinued operations of $425 million after tax, which includes $428 million of after tax gain on sale and a $3 million after tax first quarter 2005 loss on operations of the International Terminals business.
 
 
 
 
Subsequent Event
The company's board of directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split for shareholders effective August 3, 2006, a $0.10 quarterly dividend on the post-split shares effective in September 2006, and a $500 million share buyback program that the company intends to complete over the next 12 months.
All earnings per share information for the second quarter of 2006 is on a pre-split basis. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the company will be required to retrospectively apply the stock split. If the company had applied the stock split for this quarter, EPS assuming dilution would have been $.83 and $.36, for the quarters ended 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Rail Operating Revenue
Second quarter Surface Transportation revenue represents the 17
th
consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. All four major markets experienced revenue gains as a result of continued traffic re-pricing and the fuel surcharge program.
Merchandise
  Revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment. While shipments of plastics increased, overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the U.S. chemical industry's competitiveness and in turn, CSX's volumes.
Chemicals
 Continued strength in the building and highway construction markets in the southeast propelled demand for aggregate products, such as rock, sand, and cement. Shipments of municipal waste and construction and demolition debris from the metropolitan areas in the northeast also continued to show significant growth.
Emerging Markets
 Volume declined due to weakness in the printing market as electronic media continued to reduce the demand for printed paper. A favorable pricing environment improved revenue per unit in all segments, which was led by lumber, plywood and brown packaging paper. Yield management efforts also negatively affected packaging paper shipments. A general focus on longer and more profitable shipments favorably affected revenue per unit.
Forest Products
 Increased demand for ethanol as a fuel additive continued to be a key reason for strong volume growth. In addition, strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans due to lower producer prices helped volume growth.
Agricultural Products
 Domestic steel demand continued to drive high levels of production and volume gains. Pricing actions also contributed to a record revenue quarter and growth compared to last year.
Metals
 Short-haul export phosphate volume, which has lower revenue per unit, decreased significantly as increased international production caused plant shutdowns. The loss of this short-haul traffic and an increase in longer-haul domestic phosphate volume together had a significant favorable impact on revenue per unit.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Volume in this segment (which includes the transportation of refrigerated products, canned goods, building products and transportation equipment) was flat. Growth in deliveries of customer-owned freight cars, roofing granules (used to make shingles), and rice was offset by softness in shipments of ores (used in paint products), clay, and canned goods. Also, a focus on shipments that are more profitable and are moved longer distances favorably affected revenue per unit.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Revenue and volume were up on continued strong utility demand. Utility inventory levels were estimated to be at target levels at the end of the second quarter. Increased fuel surcharge coverage and a favorable pricing environment resulted in revenue-per-unit increases. Also, the second quarter of 2005 included an additional $17 million of revenue from a rate case settlement.
Automotive
Volume was flat due to a slight reduction in North American light vehicle production. Consistent with the overall automotive market, CSX's volumes continued to shift from the Big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically. Revenue per unit was favorable due to price increases and fuel surcharge.
Intermodal Operating Revenue
 Overall volume increased due to import activity from several key international customers, partially offset by continued yield management initiatives. Revenue per unit increased as a result of a strong pricing environment and fuel surcharge.
International
 Volume declined slightly from fewer shipments from the west coast that are transported by other rail carriers, partially offset by growth in the parcel and truckload markets. Additionally, the pricing environment continued to remain favorable.
Domestic
 
Table of Contents
Surface Transportation expenses increased $32 million from last year's second quarter, despite $126 million of insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased $9 million due to the effects of higher inflation partially offset by lower incentive compensation because of new long-term incentive plans.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $27 million primarily due to inflation and a prior year supplier reimbursement that was not repeated. These increases were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations, such as better usage of locomotives and fewer train accidents and related costs.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense increased $13 million due to an increasing asset base related to higher capital spending.
Depreciation
expense increased $112 million from higher fuel prices and less hedge benefit.
Fuel
decreased $5 million due to a reduction in railcar lease expense. This was a direct result of the improvement in operational fluidity, which drove improvements in shipment cycle-time and reduced the number of cars-on-line.
Building and Equipment Rent
of $126 million represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the company's insurance deductible.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries
 
 
 
decreased $8 million primarily because of less equipment leasing activity related to the company's former container shipping business. Also included in other operating income are gain amortization on the company's conveyance of its former CSX lines subsidiary, some remaining net sublease income from assets formerly included in the marine service segment, and other items.
Other Operating Income

(a) Beginning October 2005, the Association of American Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize reporting across U.S. railroads. Beginning in 2007 and going forward, CSXT will adopt this new method. If CSXT had used this new method in the second quarter and first six months of 2006, average system dwell time would have been 25.1 and 25.6 hours for those periods, respectively.
