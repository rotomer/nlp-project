 CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported third quarter 2006 net earnings of $328 million, or 71 cents per share. Earnings in the quarter included a 17 cent per-share benefit from Hurricane Katrina insurance recoveries and the resolution of certain income tax matters. Excluding these items, earnings were 54 cents per share, up 50 percent from 36 cents per share reported in the same quarter of 2005. (See table below for reconciliation of all items to reported numbers.)

(Oct. 17, 2006)
"Improved service, growing volumes and continued strong pricing drove our strong third quarter financial results," said Michael Ward, chairman and CEO of CSX Corporation. "We continue to invest in strategic capacity and create opportunities for long-term growth."
The company's Surface Transportation businesses posted record third quarter revenues of $2.4 billion, a 14 percent increase from the third quarter last year. The increase was driven by improved pricing and volume growth. Yields increased 12 percent with improvements across all markets. Volumes grew nearly two percent, led by strength in agriculture, coal and intermodal volumes, which more than offset softness in phosphates and fertilizers, automotive and forest products.
These top-line improvements, combined with continued momentum in operations, generated record third quarter Surface Transportation operating income of $489 million, including the $15 million benefit from insurance recoveries. Excluding the insurance recoveries, operating income was $474 million, a 31 percent increase over the $361 million reported in the third quarter of 2005.
"We expect demand for rail and intermodal transportation services to remain strong," said Ward. "With improved service on our extensive network, CSX is well positioned for the future."
 
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services. The company's transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Flash report available on the company's Web site at and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
In the third quarter of 2006, CSX recognized a gain of $15 million before tax, or $9 million after tax, on insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina. For the nine months of 2006 the gain was $141 million before tax, or $87 million after tax. The gain represents insurance recoveries related to property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
 
In the second quarter of 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of outstanding debt. CSX recognized $192 million of before-tax costs, or $123 million of after-tax costs, to repurchase the debt, which primarily reflects the increase in current market value above original issue value.
 
 
 
 
 
In the first quarter of 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals business for net cash proceeds of $998 million. As a result, CSX recognized earnings from discontinued operations of $425 million after tax, which includes $428 million of after tax gain on sale and a $3 million after tax first quarter 2005 loss on operations of the International Terminals business.

Rail Operating Revenue
Third quarter 2006 Surface Transportation revenue represents the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains. Continued traffic re-pricing and the fuel surcharge program drove revenue-per-unit gains across all four major markets.
Merchandise
 Revenue and revenue per unit improved due to strengths in plastics and liquid petroleum volume and a continued strong pricing environment.
Chemicals
 Shipments of aggregates, which include rock and minerals, and both industrial and municipal waste rose, resulting in increased revenue. Housing and highway construction remained steady in many coastal markets that are still rebuilding from last year's hurricanes.
Emerging Markets
 Emphasis on more profitable shipments continued to produce strong revenue and revenue-per-unit improvements across all markets. Building products shipments slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts.
Forest Products
 Solid increases in feed grain, soybean and export shipments contributed to rising volumes while the increased demand for ethanol shipments also positively impacted revenue.
Agricultural Products
 Volume increased on continued demand for pipe used in drilling and pipelines and other metals for commercial construction. Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to a continued favorable pricing environment.
Metals
 The recent closure of domestic phosphate plants and the increase in offshore phosphate production reduced the need for U.S. production and exports. This volume loss was offset by price gains in other fertilizer markets.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Market softness in building products and perishables along with volume loss in appliances were partially offset by volume growth in alcoholic beverages, rice and beans.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Coal, coke and iron ore revenues and volumes increased across all markets. Coal was up due to utilities targeting higher inventory levels going into the fall. Coke and iron ore, used in the production of steel, were up due to strengths in the metals market.
Automotive
Automotive volume declined as a result of reduced light vehicle production in North America. The rise in gas prices contributed to the decline of truck and sport utility vehicle sales. However, gains in revenue per unit were driven by strong pricing activity that partially offset the lower volume.
Intermodal
 Gains in revenue and revenue per unit were driven by a favorable pricing environment. Also, imports from Asia contributed to strong revenue.
International
 Several factors combined to increase domestic volume including improved operations and new domestic train service.
Domestic
 
Table of Contents
Surface Transportation expenses increased $165 million from last year's third quarter. Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased $11 million due to wage and benefit inflation as well as increased staffing partially offset by lower incentive compensation.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $23 million primarily due to raw materials inflation, rising insurance costs and increased business activity. This increase was partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations, such as better usage of locomotives.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense increased $9 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.
Depreciation
expense increased $112 million driven by $76 million in reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program with most of the remainder due to higher fuel prices.
Fuel
expenses increased $6 million which was in line with business activity, as well as a prior year favorable item not repeated this quarter.
Building and Equipment Rent
expenses increased $9 million primarily due to traffic mix and higher Intermodal volumes. Inland transportation is purchased transportation services from outside parties which include amounts paid to other railroads and highway movements to and from railway facilities, referred to as drayage. These expenses fluctuate with the number of units transported and the length of those shipments.
Inland Transportation
increased $10 million due to prior year federal income tax audit benefits that were not repeated in 2006. This expense item includes CSX's 42% share of Conrail's after-tax income and charges paid to Conrail for the use of shared asset areas which Conrail operates for the joint benefit of CSX and Norfolk Southern.
Conrail Rents, Fees and Services
of $15 million represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the company's insurance deductible.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries
 
improved $8 million primarily due to lower wind down costs associated with the former marine service segment and other costs that were higher in last year's quarter. This segment included gain amortization on the company's conveyance of its former CSX Lines subsidiary, remaining net sublease income, and other related expenses.
Other Operating Income

(a) Beginning October 2005, the Association of American Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize reporting across U.S. railroads. Beginning in 2007 and going forward, CSXT will adopt this new method. If CSXT had used this new method in the third quarter and first nine months of 2006, average system dwell time would have been 25.0 and 25.4 hours for those periods, respectively.
 
 
Table of Contents
 
(a) Income from Real Estate and Resort Operations includes the results of operations from CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, as well as the results of the company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition, and management and development activities.
(b) Miscellaneous income increased for the third quarter of 2006 primarily due to improved operating performance from several other CSX owned or partially owned companies. The primary driver was an energy company that offers a total logistics solution for its customers.
