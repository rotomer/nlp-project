 CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported fourth quarter 2006 earnings of $347 million, or 75 cents per share. Earnings in the quarter included an 18 cent per-share benefit from: Hurricane Katrina insurance recoveries, a gain on Conrail property included in other income, and the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, earnings were 57 cents per share, up 10 percent from the same quarter of 2005. (See table below for reconciliation of quarter and full year items to reported numbers.)
Jacksonville, Florida (Jan. 22, 2007)
"Strong pricing and reliable customer service delivered record fourth quarter financial results in our Surface Transportation businesses," said Michael Ward, chairman and CEO of CSX Corporation. "In 2006, we achieved a full-year operating ratio below 80% for the first time in nearly a decade and made break-out improvements in our railroad operations."
The Company's Surface Transportation businesses posted record fourth quarter revenues of $2.4 billion, an 8 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by strength in pricing, a growing agricultural market, export demand for coal and continued growth in imports that offset softness in the housing and automotive sectors. Yields increased over 8 percent, with improvements across nearly all markets.
These factors, combined with better operations, resulted in record fourth quarter Surface Transportation operating income of $505 million, including $27 million from insurance recoveries. Excluding the insurance recoveries, operating income was $478 million, a 15 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005.
For the full-year, CSX reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.82, including the insurance recoveries, the gain on Conrail property and income tax benefits. On a comparable basis, full-year earnings per share were $2.22, a 31% improvement over prior year's comparable results.
 
Surface Transportation full-year operating income was $2.1 billion on revenues of $9.6 billion. Excluding gains from insurance recoveries, operating income was $1.96 billion, a 26 percent improvement over prior year.
"These results helped to drive significant value for our shareholders with the company's stock price increasing 36% for 2006. In addition, we delivered further value in the year by increasing dividends 54% and by repurchasing $465 million of our stock," said Ward. "In 2007, we expect demand to be strong and our operations to be stronger, and we remain confident in our previous guidance of double-digit growth in operating income, earnings and free cash flow."
GAAP RECONCILIATION
(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the company's business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
 
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services. The company's transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Flash report available on the company's Web site at and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, CSX recognized a gain of $27 million before tax, or $17 million after tax, on insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina. For the year 2006 the gain was $168 million before tax or $104 million after tax. The gain represents insurance recoveries related to property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
 
In the second quarter of 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of outstanding debt. CSX recognized $192 million of before-tax costs, or $123 million of after-tax costs, to repurchase the debt, which primarily reflected the increase in current market value above original issue value.
 
 
 
 
 
In the first quarter of 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals business for net cash proceeds of $998 million. As a result, CSX recognized earnings from discontinued operations of $425 million after tax, which included $428 million of after tax gain on sale and a $3 million after tax first quarter 2005 loss on operations of the International Terminals business.
 
In 2006, CSX's Board of Directors approved and distributed a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split.

Rail Operating Revenue
Fourth quarter 2006 Surface Transportation revenue represents the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains. Continued traffic re-pricing was the primary driver of revenue-per-unit gains.
Merchandise
 A strong pricing environment continued to be the primary driver of gains in revenue and revenue per unit. Weakness in plastics volumes offset strengths in petroleum products such as propane.
Chemicals
 Increased revenue was supported by growth in shipments of rock and minerals. Highway construction remained steady in many coastal markets that are still rebuilding from last year's hurricanes. Revenue per unit improved due to strong pricing actions.
Emerging Markets
 Emphasis on more profitable shipments continued to produce strong revenue and revenue-per-unit growth across all forest product markets. Building products and printing paper shipments slowed due to decreased demand.
Forest Products
 High demand in feed grain, soybean, ethanol, and export shipments supported revenue per unit increases across all agricultural product markets.
Agricultural Products
 Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains. However, volumes declined as a result of lower demand in the automotive sector. The resulting high inventory levels have driven mills to reduce output in an attempt to re-balance supply with demand.
Metals
 The increase in offshore phosphate production and the closure of domestic phosphate plants in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006 reduced U.S. production. This volume loss was offset by price gains in other fertilizer markets.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Revenue per unit increased due to volume growth in alcoholic beverages and strong pricing actions, which were offset by market softness in building products and perishables as well as volume declines in the appliance market.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Revenue and volume improved due to increased shipments to utilities in the Southeastern United States and increased export volumes. Revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment. Utility inventories are believed to be at target levels.
Automotive
As a result of reduced automobile production in North America, automotive volume has continued to decrease primarily driven by a decline of truck and sport utility vehicle demand. However, these volume declines were partially offset by revenue per unit gains driven by pricing activity.
Intermodal
 Volume increased due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from Asia. Revenue per unit improvement was driven by the favorable pricing environment, offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue.
International
 Volume decreased as a result of weaker demand in the wholesale market and a modal shift in the parcel business. Increases in shorter haul truckload business and repositioning of empty containers only partially offset these volume losses. This change in the mix of traffic along with a lower fuel surcharge rate, had a negative impact on revenue per unit.
Domestic
 
Table of Contents
Surface Transportation expenses increased $87 million from last year's fourth quarter. Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased $22 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation. Also included were higher incentive compensation costs and higher staffing which was partially offset by productivity gains.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $64 million. The primary drivers are net favorable casualty reserve and other adjustments recognized in the prior year as well as current year inflation.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense increased $8 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending.
Depreciation
expense increased $31 million driven by a reduction in hedge benefits from the expiration of the fuel hedge program, offset by lower fuel prices.
Fuel
expenses decreased $11 million driven by lower volumes in some markets, as well as improvement in operational fluidity, which drove improvements in asset utilization.
Equipment and Other Rent
of $27 million represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the company's insurance deductible.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries

(a) In October 2005, the Association of American Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize reporting across U.S. railroads. Beginning in 2007 and going forward, CSXT will adopt this new method. If CSXT had used this new method in the fourth quarter and year 2006, average system dwell time would have been 24.3 and 25.1 hours for those periods, respectively.
