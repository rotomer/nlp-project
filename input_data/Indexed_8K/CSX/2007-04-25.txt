This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.

(b)
  
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.

(c)
  
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel); however, the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel only if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded upon advice of counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 7 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)  unless such settlement, compromise, or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

16
(d)
  
If the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively ) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and by the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company in connection with the purchase of the Notes hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.
Losses

8.
  
.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that if the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Notes within 36 hours of such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except as otherwise provided in Section 10.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or to any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the applicable Notes, if prior to such time (i) there shall have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Notes, (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), (iii) trading in any of the Companys securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (iv) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereof or thereto after the date hereof).

UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
TRANSFERS OF THIS SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF CEDE & CO. OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSORS NOMINEE.
 
 
This security (the Security) is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the Securities) of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the Company, which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, and a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the Indenture) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series.  Any such additional Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued.  Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or 906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $300,000,000 (THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the Principal Amount) of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
 
 
 
 
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $300,000,000 (THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) on May 1, 2017 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from April 25, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2007, and at Maturity at the rate of 5.600% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.  The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 15 or October 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph.  If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the Depository) notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof.  Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar.  Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.

Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by the Company for that purpose.  Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted.  Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity.  If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security  and the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests represented hereby, and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

This security (the Security) is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the Securities) of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the Company, which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, and a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the Indenture) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 (FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series. Any such additional Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or 906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $500,000,000 (FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the Principal Amount) of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
 
 
 
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $500,000,000 (FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) on May 1, 2037 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from April 25, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2007, and at Maturity at the rate of 6.150% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 15 or October 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph. If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the Depository) notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof. Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
 
 
2
 
Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by the Company for that purpose. Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity. If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests represented hereby, and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

CUSIP No. 126408GK3
 
This security (the Security) is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the Securities) of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the Company, which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, and a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the Indenture) reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 (TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series. Any such additional Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or 906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $200,000,000 (TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the Principal Amount) of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
 
 
 
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $200,000,000 (TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) on May 1, 2037 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from April 25, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2007, and at Maturity at the rate of 6.150% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 15 or October 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph.

Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity. If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.

As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the purchase price for the Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
Section 101 of the Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following definitions:
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event means that on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control; or (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by CSX to effect a Change of Control, the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).

Change of Control Repurchase Event means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event.
Fitch means Fitch Ratings Ltd.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
 
April 25, 2007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the purchase by the several Underwriters (the Underwriters) listed in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement dated as of April 20, 2007 (the Underwriting Agreement), among Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as Representatives of the Underwriters, from the Company of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 5.600% Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) and $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 6.150% Notes due 2037 (the 2037 Notes and, together with the 2017 Notes, the Notes) to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture) dated as of August 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004 and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007.

In that connection, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion, including:  (a) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended; (b) the By-laws of the Company; (c) resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 13, 2006 and February 14, 2007, and the Action of Authorized Pricing Officers of the Company dated as of April 20, 2007; (d) the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-140732) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on February 15, 2007 (the Registration Statement), for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) of an indeterminate aggregate amount of various securities of the Company, to be issued from time to time by the Company; (e) the related Base Prospectus dated February 15, 2007 (together with the documents incorporated therein by reference, the Base Prospectus); (f) the Prospectus Supplement dated April 20, 2007, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus); (g) the documents and other information described in Annex A to this letter (together, the Disclosure Package), including the Term Sheet, dated April 20, 2007, filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the Term Sheet); (h) the Underwriting Agreement; and (i) the Indenture and the form of the Note.  We have also relied upon advice from the Commission that the Registration Statement was declared effective on February 15, 2007. We have relied, with respect to certain factual matters, on the representations and warranties of the Company and the Underwriters contained in the Underwriting Agreement, and have assumed compliance by each such party with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.  In particular, but without limitation, we have relied upon the Companys representation that it has not been notified pursuant to Rule 401(g) of the Securities Act of any objection by the Commission to the use of the form on which the Registration Statement was filed.
 
Our identification of information as part of the Disclosure Package has been at your request and with your approval.  Such identification is for the limited purpose of making the statements set forth in this opinion regarding the Disclosure Package and is not the expression of a view by us as to whether any such information has been or should have been conveyed to investors generally or to any particular investors at any particular time or in any particular manner.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth herein, we are of opinion as follows:
           Assuming that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and, assuming that the Notes have been duly authorized, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and Prospectus and will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

           The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
2.
           The Registration Statement initially became effective under the Securities Act on February 15, 2007; the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3), the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5), and the Term Sheet was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433.  Thereupon, assuming prior payment by the Company of the pay-as-you-go registration fee for the offering of Notes, upon the filing of the Prospectus with the Commission, the offering of the Notes as contemplated by the Prospectus became registered under the Securities Act; to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Securities Act.
3.
           The Company is not an investment company as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
4.
           The statements made in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions Description of Debt Securities and Description of Notes, insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, and under the caption Certain Tax Considerations, insofar as they purport to describe the material tax consequences of an investment in Notes, fairly summarize the matters therein described.
5.
 
We express no opinion with respect to compliance with, or the application or effect of, any laws or regulations relating to the ownership or operation of a railroad to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject or the necessity of any authorization, approval or action by, or any notice to, consent of, order of, or filing with, any governmental authority, pursuant to any such laws or regulations.
We express no opinion herein as to any provision of the Indenture or the Notes that (a) relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America, or any Federal appellate court, to adjudicate any controversy related to the Indenture or the Notes, (b) contains a waiver of an inconvenient forum or (c) relates to the waiver of rights to jury trial. We also express no opinion as to (i) the enforceability of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes to the extent that such provisions constitute a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations or any other defense to performance which cannot, as a matter of law, be effectively waived, or (ii) whether a state court outside the State of New York or a Federal court of the United States would give effect to the choice of New York law provided for in the Indenture or the Notes.

We understand that you are satisfying yourselves as to the status under Section548 of the Bankruptcy Code and applicable state fraudulent conveyance laws of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and the Notes, and we express no opinion thereon.
We are admitted to practice in the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States of America.  In particular, we do not purport to pass on any matter governed by the laws of Virginia.
In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the correctness of, and take no responsibility for, the opinion dated April 25, 2007, of CSX Corporation, a copy of which has been delivered to you pursuant to paragraph (d) of Section 5 of the Underwriting Agreement, as to all matters of law covered therein relating to the laws of Virginia.
We are furnishing this opinion to you, as Representatives, solely for your benefit and the benefit of the several Underwriters.  This opinion may not be relied upon by any other person (including by any person that acquires the Notes from the several Underwriters or for any other purpose).  It may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
