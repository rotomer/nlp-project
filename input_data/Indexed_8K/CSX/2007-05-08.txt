JACKSONVILLE, Fla., (May 8, 2007)  Underscoring its commitment to enhance shareholder value, the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) has approved a series of initiatives that will deliver both near- and long-term value.  Based on the strong long-term outlook for freight rail and intermodal transportation and higher earnings expectations for CSX businesses, the company intends to:
These actions emphasize our confidence in the earnings power of CSX businesses as demand for our rail and intermodal services is robust and expected to grow, said Michael Ward, chairman, president and CEO of CSX Corporation.  We remain committed to driving shareholder value through earnings growth and a balanced approach that includes stock buybacks, dividend increases and long-term investments that also benefit our customers, employees and the national economy.
CSX affirmed today that it expects to achieve record levels of operating income and earnings per share in 2007, while delivering strong free cash flow.  Going forward, CSX expects to deliver double-digit increases in operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow on an average annual basis through 2010.
Having doubled our core earning power over the last three years, we believe CSX can support these steps with higher cash flows and additional leverage, said Oscar Munoz, executive vice president and chief financial officer. At the same time, CSX remains committed to an investment grade credit profile to preserve its ability to invest and provide the high levels of safety, customer service and infrastructure development that are essential to its long-term growth, to its employees and to the public.
The Boards authorization of an additional $1 billion in common stock repurchases brings the current stock repurchase program  which extends through year-end 2008  to $3 billion, or approximately 15 percent of the companys total market capitalization.  Combined with its prior stock repurchase program, CSX expects to have repurchased a total of $3.5 billion of outstanding shares over the three-year period ending in December of 2008.
 
The Board also approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the companys common stock by 25 percent to 15 cents, payable September 14, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2007.  With that payment, CSX will have tripled its annual dividend rate in less than two years.
In addition, the company expects to make core capital investments of approximately $1.5 billion in 2007, $1.6 billion in both 2008 and 2009, and $1.7 billion in 2010.  These investments will improve and add track, equipment, technology and facilities to help meet customer needs and the expected increase in demand for U.S. freight transportation.
Under its current stock repurchase program, CSX is buying back shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws.  The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by the companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors.
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services.  The companys transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.

GAAP Reconciliation Disclosure
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the Companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided Surface Transportation operating income and earnings per share adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  The Companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.  Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information.  Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations.  A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.  delivering.  CSX 15
