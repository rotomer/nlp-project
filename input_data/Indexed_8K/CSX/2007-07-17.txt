CSX Reports Strong Second Quarter Earnings
Surface Transportation Highlights:
 
 
 CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported second quarter 2007 earnings of $324 million, or 71 cents per share. Last year the company reported second quarter earnings of $390 million, or 83 cents per share, including a 25 cents per-share gain from insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these items, earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 were 58 cents. (See table below for reconciliation of quarter items to reported numbers.)
Jacksonville, Florida (July 17, 2007)
"CSX employees delivered another great quarter with record revenues, strong safety and service performances and increased productivity," said Michael Ward, chairman, president and CEO. "These results continue to reflect the renaissance in both our industry and our company.
"We are pleased with the value we are creating for our shareholders on a sustained basis," said Ward. "In the three-years ending June 30, the value of CSX stock nearly tripled from $16.39 to $45.08, placing our growth among the top 5 percent of all stocks in the S&P 500."
Second quarter revenues were a quarterly record $2.5 billion, a nearly 5 percent increase over the second quarter of 2006. Strong pricing drove revenue-per-unit gains of 7 percent while overall second quarter volume was down approximately 2 percent, compared to last year, reflecting continued softness in the housing- and automotive-related sectors of the economy.
CSX Surface Transportation businesses recorded second quarter operating income of $603 million. Second quarter 2006 operating income was $645 million, including $126 million of insurance recovery gains. On a comparable basis, excluding the insurance recoveries, operating income rose 16 percent in the second quarter 2007.
The sustained pricing momentum achieved by CSX, as well as productivity, safety and service improvements, combined to reduce the Company's operating ratio to 76.2 percent for the quarter, better than last year's second quarter on a comparable basis by 240 basis points.
"We remain focused on delivering a compelling value equation for shareholders by continuing to drive double-digit growth in our financial performance," said Ward. "At the same time, we are committed to managing our capital structure through a balanced approach that includes investments in our vital rail infrastructure for the long-term, share repurchases and dividend increases."
In the second quarter, CSX repurchased $548 million of its common stock as part of its $3.0 billion share repurchase program. In total, the company has repurchased $727 million and expects to complete the program by the end of 2008. During the second quarter, CSX also announced a 25% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.15, payable in September to shareholders.
 
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services. The company's transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.

CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the company's business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided Surface Transportation operating income and earnings per share adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The company's management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSX's ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided above. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
 
In the second quarter of 2006, CSX recognized a gain of $126 million before tax, or $78 million after tax, on insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina. There was no gain recognized in the second quarter of 2007. For the six months ended June 29, 2007 the gain was $18 million before tax or $11 million after tax. The gain represents insurance recoveries related to property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
 
In the second quarter of 2006, CSX recognized a tax benefit of $41 million principally related to the resolution of certain tax matters.
 
In July 2006, CSX's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second quarter 2007 Surface Transportation revenue represents more than five years of quarter-over-quarter revenue gains. A favorable pricing environment continued to be the primary driver of revenue gains offsetting weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets.
Merchandise
 Volumes were flat as gains in inorganic acids used in fertilizer production, chemicals used in the textile industry, and petroleum products were offset by volume declines in chlorine and industrial sand shipments. Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to pricing gains.
Chemicals
 Revenue and revenue per unit improved through positive mix changes that included an increase in high revenue per-unit shipments in military moves and in the cement market due to higher demand. Aggregate shipments, which include rocks and minerals, declined due to continued weakness in residential construction.
Emerging Markets
 Volume declines in lumber and panel shipments were driven by continued weakness in residential construction. Volumes were also negatively affected by lower paper production and a decrease in domestic newsprint and printing paper consumption. Strong pricing efforts and favorable mix changes led to gains in revenue per unit.
Forest Products
 Volume increased overall primarily from feed ingredients, vegetable oil, soybeans, and ethanol contributing to favorable revenue and revenue per unit gains. Ethanol continued to be a significant growth driver due to higher demand, while export grain shipments declined due to higher corn prices.
Agricultural Products
 Steel production decreased due to weakness in the automotive and housing industries, causing a slight decline in shipments. This decline was partially offset by strength in steel exports. Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued yield management initiatives.
Metals
 While fertilizer shipments rose due in part to higher demand for corn from ethanol producers, these gains were more than offset by volume losses related to several phosphate plant closures. Revenue per unit increased due to yield management initiatives and a reduction in low revenue-per-unit phosphate shipments.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Volume declines were driven by decreased demand for wallboard, shingles and other building products as a result of continued weakness in residential construction. Revenue per unit increased driven by continued pricing efforts.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Favorable pricing efforts and fuel surcharge coverage increases positively impacted revenue and revenue per unit. Volume was down slightly due to declines in utility shipments which were partially offset by the strong demand for export coal. Total tons shipped were up due to a continuing trend to ship more coal per carload.
Automotive
Revenue per unit improved as a result of continued focus on yield management. These gains helped offset volume declines due to continued weakness in automotive production driven by lower sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles.
Other Rail Revenue
The primary driver of this positive change was the increase in business generated by the Company's short line railroads.
Intermodal
 Volumes were lower primarily due to the closing of a facility and losses due to select steamship carriers withdrawing from certain markets. Revenue per unit increased due to continued strength in pricing.
International
 Volumes increased due to a new shorter-haul train service. The unfavorable mix impact on revenue per unit from this new traffic more than offset price gains in the remaining domestic business.
Domestic
 The primary driver of this revenue decrease was the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers and other ancillary services.
Other
 
Surface Transportation expenses increased $151 million from last year's second quarter. Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased $26 million primarily due to the effect of inflation and a newly ratified labor agreement that included performance based compensation. The increases were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations and lower volume, which resulted in a reduction of train crews.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $18 million. This increase included higher inflation, allowance for non-freight related receivables and various other items. The increases were offset by a favorable $30 million personal injury reserve adjustment as a result of safety improvements over the past several years.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense increased $5 million. A larger asset base related to higher capital spending was partially offset by lower depreciation rates generated by an asset life study that is required periodically.
Depreciation
expense decreased $23 million due to lower volumes in certain markets, improvement in asset utilization driven by better operations and the estimation of settlements with other railroads.
Equipment and Other Rents
of $126 million in 2006 was not repeated in the second quarter of 2007 due to timing of cash receipts.
Gain on Insurance Recoveries
 
 
(a) In October 2005, the Association of American Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize publicly reported dwell times on the AAR Railroad Performance Measures website. Dwell times in all public documents represent the Company's historical method for calculating dwell for internal management and analysis. Regardless of which method is used, trends for the two are the same. Dwell times using the AAR calculation were 23.5 and 24.0 hours for the second quarter and six months of 2007, respectively.
 
(b) 2006 amounts are net of fuel hedge benefits.
