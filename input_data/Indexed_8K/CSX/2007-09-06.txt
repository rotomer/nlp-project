On September 6, 2007, CSX Corporation (the "Company") issued the CSX Corporation 2006-2007 Corporate Profile (the "Corporate Profile"). A copy of the Corporate Profile is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
Also on September 6, 2007, the Company held an investor and analyst conference in New York City. At the conference, the Company announced that it will refinance a portion of its locomotive capacity by retiring 150 leased units and replacing those with 100 new, more fuel-efficient locomotives, which will result in an additional capital outlay of $200 million in 2007 and bring the Company's total capital investment for the year to $1.7 billion. This transaction is expected to generate a 17% return on capital, which is substantially above the Company's cost of capital.
At the conference, the Company also affirmed financial targets of a 10%-12% increase in operating income and a 15%-17% increase in earnings per share on an average annual basis through 2010, and an operating ratio in the mid- to low-70s by 2010. In addition, the Company said that free cash flow in 2007 would be approximately $100 million. Free cash flow is expected to reach $800 million to $1 billion in 2010, before the payment of dividends. These targets assume sustained economic growth through 2010.
The conference presentation was webcast simultaneously with the filing of this Current Report and is available, along with the Corporate Profile, on the Company's website at .*

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the company's business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the SEC may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In certain information that is publicly available, CSX has provided non-GAAP financial measures. This information is provided because the company's management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these non-GAAP measures.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSX's ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. Additionally, CSX's definitions may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
LETTER FROM
The Chairman
 
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Dear Investors:
In our 180th year of meeting America's transportation needs, we are building on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision  create a railroad that safely and reliably serves the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. Today, we remain dedicated to that vision, while at the same time delivering exceptional value to shareholders.
As the nation consumes increasingly higher quantities of imported goods, it needs those products to be transported across the country in a way that protects the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes costs.
CSX's transportation network, located in the highest and fastest-growing concentrations of consumers in the nation, is ideally positioned to capitalize on the new trends in freight transportation. More than two-thirds of Americans live within CSX's service territory, accounting for about three-quarters of the nation's consumption.
Our network serves an economically resilient portfolio of markets, from domestically abundant coal to emerging ethanol, from automobiles produced by traditional American manufacturers to "new domestic" factories owned by European, Japanese and Korean companies, and from life-essential chemicals to life-enriching consumer electronics.
Good For Investors
A whole new wave of investors  both large and small  is becoming familiar with the renaissance in the rail industry and the bright outlook for CSX. We're proud of the fact that investors who have been with us for the past three years have received returns in the top 5% of the S&P 500 companies.
Shareholder value is first and foremost created by strong results. On a comparable basis, for the three years ended in June, CSX more than doubled its operating income and earnings per share and significantly improved its operating ratio.
During that time, we made substantial improvements in safety and on-time performance, and our customers recognize the difference. Independent surveys of our customers show the highest satisfaction scores ever achieved by CSX.
 
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
We are confident in our ability to maintain this momentum. We see clearly the opportunity to achieve double-digit increases in operating income and earnings per share on an average annual basis through 2010. We expect to reach an operating ratio in the mid- to low-70s by 2010, and we will remain diligent in our efforts to continually improve safety and service.
In addition to strong performance, we believe that investors are best served by a balanced approach in deploying our capital that takes into account the needs of our shareholders, our customers, our employees, the communities we serve and our nation.
We achieve that balance through a three-pronged approach that includes:
Share repurchases. Our current $3 billion repurchase program represents approximately 15% of our market value.
Dividends. In September 2007 we increased our dividend 25%, tripling in just two years.
Investments in our future. CSX is on track to invest well over $6 billion in its businesses between 2007 and 2010.
Investing in our businesses is a critical part of creating shareholder value in both the short and long term. Every day, we help meet the needs of the nation using our 21,000-mile network. We own it, we maintain it, we expand it to meet new demands and we make it safe.
Good For America
Railroads have been called the circulatory system of the American economy. Never before have we been more vital to the nation or better positioned to respond to its needs with long-term solutions.
We transport coal to light American homes, grain to feed livestock and poultry, military equipment to protect our homeland and consumer goods that enhance the quality of our lives. We're also there for the safe movement of passengers and commuters who ride our tracks across the country and through cities like Boston and Washington, D.C.
We will continue to invest in that network, further improve our operations and advance our leadership role in helping the nation address modern-day challenges, including the need for energy independence and environmental stewardship. CSX is making outstanding progress in reducing greenhouse gases and other emissions from locomotives, and was the first transportation company to join the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program.
 
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT INVESTORS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS HAVE RECEIVED RETURNS IN THE TOP 5% OF THE S&P 500 COMPANIES.
As CEO, I'm very energized by our company's culture and our loyal, dedicated employees. This culture has been sustained and strengthened by an infusion of new employees replacing many long-term railroaders who have moved on to a well-earned retirement. All along our 21,000 miles of railroad, we see a growing passion for satisfying customer needs and for building a railroad for the future that can meet America's increasing transportation needs safely, efficiently and responsibly.
As you read through the pages of this Corporate Profile, keep in mind that none of our successes would have been possible without thousands of CSX customers who themselves have adapted to the changing needs of our nation and kept our economy moving at a robust pace.
Our commitment to serve them and provide transportation solutions for America fuels our ability to create value for you, our shareholders.
Best regards,
Michael Ward September 2007

OVERVIEW OF INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS
OVERVIEW OF
INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS
For more than three years, the American railroad industry has been experiencing a resurgence spurred by a growing economy, increasing demand for transportation services and the cost and environmental advantages of railroads.
Transportation Demand
Long-term volume growth is based on a simple formula: increases in population lead to higher consumption, in turn driving the production of goods domestically and abroad. These goods must be transported from factories and ports to the markets where they will be consumed.
Recent census projections estimate today's population of 301 million people will grow to more than 336 million by 2020. Major metropolitan areas in the Southeast, where CSX has a strong presence, are projected to grow at significantly faster rates. Even in the slower-growing Northeast, consumption levels are projected to increase.
Population growth, higher consumption and shifts in where some of these goods are produced will continue to drive growth in imports. Global Insight, an economic and financial forecasting firm, projects that imports will grow nearly 5% per year through 2020. As a result, the number of containers flowing through U.S. ports is expected to increase substantially. These goods will need to be transported from their ports of entry, leading to increased lengths of haul as they are brought across the country to their final destinations.
Freight tonnage  domestic and international  is expected to increase nearly 50% by 2020, according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), placing further strain on the transportation system and requiring reliable solutions for shippers worldwide.
Rail Solution
The cost efficiency and environmental friendliness of rail transportation make railroads the natural choice for meeting the nation's growing transportation needs.
Highways are already congested, and this congestion is projected to worsen. Expanding these roadways will be difficult, given the lack of available property in densely populated urban centers and the cost to taxpayers, which can reach $10 million or more per mile. By contrast, railroad expansion typically costs between $1 million and $3 million per mile and is predominantly funded by the private sector.
The trucking industry also faces significant operating hurdles. New regulations on hours of service, driver shortages, rising insurance costs and more stringent emissions standards are making it more difficult for trucking companies to manage their expense structure.
In response to these challenges, trucking companies are beginning to partner with railroads to outsource their long-haul services and reduce their cost of shipping. This is an opportunity for both industries to leverage the superior cost structure of the railroads and the trucking industry's expertise in local delivery to produce profitable growth.
The need for environmentally sensitive transportation solutions also favors rail. A single train can shift at least 280 truckloads onto the railroad network, reducing highway congestion and pollution while moving goods more efficiently, because railroads are three times more fuel efficient. As a result, rails emit one-third the amount of nitrogen oxide and particulates as trucks.
Revenue Growth
Industry analysts predict that the pricing environment will reflect the increasing importance of railroads in serving America's growing transportation needs and the cost of the infrastructure investments needed to maintain the safety and security of these networks and to expand them. This will drive strong revenue growth as volumes increase.
While the market for transportation services remains competitive, tighter capacity and improved service levels are expected to sustain this favorable pricing environment, reflecting the overall value that railroads provide to their customers. The major North American railroads not only have been improving key service measurements, such as on-time originations and arrivals, dwell time and velocity, but in 2006 had their safest year ever, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
COMPANY OVERVIEW
For 180 years, CSX has been meeting America's transportation needs. Today, the company continues to provide transportation solutions to major manufacturers, energy producers, farmers, small shippers and local, state and federal governments.
With a rail network that runs up and down the East Coast, spans the Southeast and reaches west to the Mississippi River, CSX has a strong presence in rapidly growing metropolitan markets where two-thirds of the population lives and three-fourths of the nation's consumption occurs. The company's Surface
Transportation businesses are vital arteries connecting commerce to communities and alleviating increased congestion on the nation's highways.
A major transportation provider for the nation's energy companies, CSX is the largest coal transporter east of the Mississippi River, helping provide the fuel to power American homes and businesses. As the nation's energy supply continues to diversify, the company also provides transportation for growing alternative energy products such as ethanol.
CSX works to feed America, transporting more than 21 million tons of grain annually and supplying more than half the feed needed for the livestock industry in the Southeast. The company also features specialized services like the Tropicana Juice Train, now in its 30th year, which delivers orange juice from Florida to the Northeast, Ohio and California.
The company is a major transporter for America's armed forces, delivering the supplies and machinery needed to keep the nation strong and secure.
New services like the high-speed intermodal corridor from Los Angeles to Atlanta offer customers reliable ways to move consumer goods from the nation's West Coast markets to distribution centers in the growing Southeast.
Surface Transportation Businesses
CSX Transportation, Inc., (CSXT) provides a crucial link to the transportation supply chain through its 21,000-mile rail network, which serves every major population center in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It serves 70 ocean, river and lake ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This unit also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 230 short-line and regional railroads.
12
 
COMPANY OVERVIEW
CSX Intermodal, Inc. (Intermodal), one of the nation's largest coast-to-coast intermodal transportation providers, links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. Intermodal helps keep distribution centers ready to deliver clothing, electronic and other consumer products to retail outlets coast to coast.
CSX also owns Total Distribution Services, Inc., which serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations, and TRANSFLO, which provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to truck at more than 60 facilities across the country.
These four subsidiaries primarily combine to form the company's Surface Transportation businesses, which continue to deliver record results for shareholders.
Transportation Markets
CSX's Surface Transportation businesses delivered nearly 7.4 million carloads in 2006, generating $9.6 billion of revenue, an 11% increase over 2005.
Merchandise. This is the most diverse market, with nearly three million carloads per year of aggregate, metal, phosphate, building, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, paper and chemical products. In 2006, this market accounted for nearly 50% of CSX's total revenue.
Coal. Nearly 1.9 million carloads of coal, coke and iron ore were delivered in 2006 for electric utilities, manufacturers and export markets. Coal continues to play a vital role in the generation of energy used to heat, cool and light America's homes and businesses. In addition, coal exports remain strong, reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar. In 2006, coal generated nearly 25% of CSX's total revenue.
Automotive. This market accounted for 463,000 carloads and contributed approximately 10% of the company's total revenue in 2006. CSX delivers one-third of North America's light vehicles, serving both traditional manufacturers and the increasing number of global manufacturers.
Intermodal. In 2006, the company handled nearly 2.2 million containers and trailers of consumer products, which generated nearly 15% of CSX's total revenue. As the rail renaissance continues to unfold, CSX anticipates this business will become a strong growth engine for the company.
13
 
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Rail Network
The company's train operations focus around four major transportation networks and 36 major terminals. These major networks are the coal network, the Southeastern Corridor, the Interstate 90 Corridor, and the Interstate 95 Corridor.
Coal Network. The CSX coal network connects 130 mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities. This network also supports the strong, growing utility market in the Southeast. With increasing demand for electricity, this network will continue to play a vital role in the nation's economy.
Southeastern Corridor. Running from the western gateways of Chicago, Memphis and St. Louis through the growing cities of Nashville, Birmingham and Atlanta and into the expanding markets in the Southeast, this premier corridor plays an integral role in the company's long-term growth strategies. The corridor extends through the Illinois coal basin and is an important route for merchandise, intermodal and automotive traffic. The Southeastern Corridor was the primary focus of the company's recent capacity expansion investments, which included double track and longer sidings in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia.
Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor. The I-90 Corridor links Chicago, New York and New England. Much of this route has double track supporting high-speed intermodal and automotive services. It is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. Continued growth in consumption in the East and Northeast makes this corridor a critical element in the company's overall system.
Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor. Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing Southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York along the I-95 Corridor. This route is primarily used to ship food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals. It serves as the only rail corridor along the East Coast south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to all the major eastern ports.
Non-Transportation Holdings
CSX Hotels, Inc., operates the Greenbrier Resort and Club, a AAA Five-Diamond resort for 31 consecutive years that is located in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. CSX Real Property, another subsidiary, is responsible for the sale, lease and development of CSX-owned properties.

SHAREHOLDER VALUE
SHAREHOLDER
VALUE
CSX has produced superior financial results over the last three years while setting the stage for substantial value creation in the future. That future is based on the company's double-digit growth expectations for operating income and earnings per share through 2010.
Recent Performance
Through June of 2007, the company's one-year and three-year stock returns significantly outpaced those of the major indexes and the other major North American railroads. During those periods, the company's stock price increased 28% and 175% respectively. The company's three-year performance places it among the top 5% of all stocks in the S&P 500.
CSX's stock performance has been driven by an improvement in earnings, which have more than doubled since 2004. During that time, CSX has added more than $1.5 billion of revenue through disciplined pricing actions and favorable shifts in traffic mix. At the same time, the company has improved safety and service to record levels through leadership, discipline and execution of its strategy.
In 2007 on a comparable basis, CSX expects to again deliver record operating income and earnings per share. The company's return on invested capital, which has also increased substantially since 2004, is expected to approach the cost of capital in 2007 and to exceed it beginning in 2008.
Balance for the Future
CSX has been investing in its transportation network to expand capacity and make way for significant new business, as the nation looks to railroads to relieve highway congestion. CSX plans to invest well over $6 billion of capital between 2007 and 2010 to maintain its core asset base, improve productivity and further position the company for long-term growth.
These investments will be the foundation for future shareholder returns, as the company expects double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share through 2010. Over that same period, CSX expects to further improve its operating ratio and its return on invested capital.

As part of its balanced approach to delivering value for shareholders, the company has tripled its dividend over the last two years. In addition, CSX expects to complete a $3 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2008. This program represents approximately 15% of CSX's market capitalization and is currently the most aggressive program among the major North American railroads.

CREDIT PROFILE
CREDIT PROFILE
A critical component of CSX's balanced approach to delivering long-term value for shareholders is its strategy to maintain an investment grade credit profile with the major rating agencies.
The company's long-term credit ratings from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Services (Moody's) are currently BBB- and Baa3 respectively. Both agencies indicate their outlook for CSX is "Stable" at the low-end of the investment grade spectrum, reflecting the company's stable cash flows and its strong liquidity profile, along with solid industry fundamentals.
CSX uses a variety of financial measures to evaluate, monitor and manage its capital structure, including funds-from-operations-to-adjusted debt (FFO-to-debt), retained cash flow-to-adjusted debt (RCF-to-debt), and all-in debt-to-capital. For additional information on how these financial measures are calculated, refer to the calculation of non-GAAP measures section of the Appendix.
The company targets the low end of the investment grade spectrum as part of its comprehensive strategy to pursue the lowest long-term cost of capital, while still retaining strong and reliable access to capital.
By maintaining a BBB-/Baa3 profile, CSX retains the financial flexibility required in an asset-intensive industry in which all major competitors are investment-grade. As an investment grade company, CSX is better positioned to weather unforeseen challenges in the economy, including disruptions to the capital markets. Falling below investment grade would reduce the company's access to capital and increase the cost and restrictions of that capital.
With well over $6 billion of capital investment planned between 2007 and 2010, financial flexibility and access to affordable capital play a vital role in CSX's balanced approach of investing for long-term growth and returning surplus capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS
INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS
As part of a balanced approach to delivering long-term value for shareholders, CSX will invest well over $6 billion in its transportation businesses between 2007 and 2010. These investments come at a time when the return on investment in the railroad industry is improving. By leveraging the company's long-term growth potential, CSX expects to produce returns that will exceed its cost of capital.
In 2007, the company expects to invest about $1.5 billion in infrastructure, locomotives, freight cars, technology and new capacity. In addition, CSX will refinance a portion of its locomotive capacity by retiring 150 leased units and replacing them using $200 million of additional locomotive capital. This transaction is expected to generate a return substantially above the company's cost of capital.
Annual transportation investments will remain relatively constant through 2010 and will support the company's double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. In addition, these investments will help drive CSX's operating ratio to the mid- to low-70s by 2010.
Infrastructure Capital
About 60% of the company's capital is targeted for infrastructure investment to improve network reliability and recoverability and to drive even better performance in safety. These infrastructure investments  rail, ties, ballast and bridges  continue to position CSX to meet the strong demand for rail transportation services.
Equipment Capital
Another 20% of the company's capital will be invested in its freight car and locomotive fleets, including the additional locomotives targeted in 2007 to retire older leased units. The new freight cars being purchased have higher loading capacities, while the new locomotives are more reliable, more fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly.
Strategic Capital
The remaining 20% of CSX's capital spending will further expand network and terminal capacity, improve technology and position the company for long-term growth. Network investments will continue to focus on CSX's major corridors, and key terminal investments will include a new intermodal facility in Chambersburg, Pa., which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2007.

ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP
ENVIRONMENTAL
LEADERSHIP
CSX understands that what's good for the environment is good for customers, employees and the bottom line. That's why the company is developing long-term, comprehensive climate change strategies and is leading the way to cleaner air through increased fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
In March 2007, CSX became the first company in the transportation industry to join the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Climate Leaders program, pledging to annually inventory and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions and establish a voluntary goal for reducing them.
The EPA estimates that for every ton-mile, a typical truck emits roughly three times more nitrogen oxide and particulates than a locomotive. When rails and the trucking industry partner to put trailers and containers on intermodal service, they are taking steps to improve the environment. If just 10% of the nation's freight was shifted to rail, fuel savings would approach one billion gallons annually.
CSX's long-standing commitment to continuous, consistent improvement has allowed the company to improve its fuel efficiency through new technology and conservation efforts. Today, railroads can move a ton of freight 423 miles, on average, per gallon of diesel fuel. New technologies like the CSX-patented Auxiliary Power Unit reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 79% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 91% during locomotive idling.
In addition, the company is upgrading its locomotive fleet with more efficient, environmentally friendly locomotives. By 2009, more than 1,200 CSX locomotives will have been upgraded to further reduce emissions and reduce fuel consumption by nearly 10 million gallons.
In 2007, for the fifth time in eight years, an employee was honored with the John H. Chafee Environmental Award, railroading's highest environmental honor. This is a testament to the company's strong culture and commitment to environmental principles. The Chafee Award highlights the benefits of rail transportation, which provides an environmentally friendly alternative to moving freight. This year's winner led implementation of a horsepower reduction program that greatly reduces fuel consumption and locomotive emissions.
CSX recognizes the importance of conserving all raw materials, not just fuel. Through programs and policies, the company encourages recycling and waste minimization. Suppliers are encouraged to utilize reusable or recyclable containers for all goods the railroad receives for shipping. Recycling allows the company to reduce the amount of material sent to landfills, and to improve the bottom line as these materials are either reused or sold.

SAFETY IS A WAY OF LIFE
SAFETY IS A WAY OF LIFE
With the ultimate goal of zero injuries and zero accidents, safety is a top priority at CSX, whose 35,000 employees are proud to safely, securely and responsibly move the goods that people need across America.
Having reduced employee injuries by nearly 40% and train accidents by 30% over the past two years, the company is now a recognized safety leader in an industry that the U.S. Department of Labor ranks as one of the safest in the country  outpacing all other modes of transportation as well as other industries like farming, manufacturing and groceries.
CSX's commitment to safety is reinforced across the company through regular training and assessment programs. Expanding capacity, upgrading track geometry and improving grade crossings also enhance safety at a time when demand for rail transportation remains strong.
In addition to training its employees, CSX trains first responders in communities through which it operates. Through close coordination with federal, state and local officials, and on-going investment, CSX works to protect communities and maintain the safety and security of the rail infrastructure.
The company also works closely with customers to ensure safe shipments. Each year the company honors those chemical companies that ship more than 600 railcars in a year without experiencing a single, non-accidental chemical release. In 2006, 63% of CSX's eligible chemical customers met this stringent requirement, the most ever.
Technology plays a strong role in maintaining the safety and security of the railroad, enabling employees to respond quickly and effectively. One technology in use throughout the network, the Network Operations Workstation (NOW) system, is a proprietary, online network that allows CSX to monitor, identify and respond to rail security issues. Technology, such as the NOW system, coupled with other ongoing investments, allows CSX to continue to increase reliability, capacity, safety and security.
In the summer of 2007, CSX entered into pilot programs with New York, New Jersey and Kentucky that provide state security officials with access to the NOW system.
Through the NOW system, New York, New Jersey and Kentucky security and law enforcement officials are able to independently track the locations of the company's trains and the contents of railcars being hauled in their respective states in a nearly real-time environment.

OPERATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
OPERATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
Early in 2004, CSX began changing the company's operating culture through a focus on leadership, discipline and execution. Combined with a variety of initiatives, anchored by the ONE Plan, the company has achieved significant operational improvements that have enhanced reliability, customer service and productivity. The ONE Plan provides a disciplined, scheduled approach to identify the most efficient, cost-effective routes for customer traffic throughout the rail network.
These initiatives focus on leveraging the ONE Plan with better locomotive management and improved asset utilization. In addition, the company improved training, implemented best practices for crew availability and enhanced the company's grade crossing safety programs.
Both internal and external measures show that customer satisfaction levels are at all-time highs. The more disciplined operations are helping the company drive its operating ratio into the mid- to low-70s by 2010.
Since implementing the ONE Plan in 2004, the railroad has delivered consistent, continuous improvement for its customers. On-time originations have increased more than 50%, and on-time arrivals are up more than 60%.
Dwell time and cars-on-line have also improved significantly. Velocity, a measure of consistency, has gradually improved across the network.
These service improvements reflect a dedication among CSX employees to a culture of excellence. State-of-the-art training for new employees and field training for first-line supervisors have helped create this high-performance culture that is driving superior service for customers.
The company also employs technology throughout the network to increase productivity, eliminate cost and improve safety and customer service:
The new Integrated Track Inspection System, which was designed and implemented by company employees, is an electronic track inspection system linked to GIS mapping of the network that has made a significant impact on the company's ability to improve safety and productivity.
The Event Recording Auto Download system (ERAD), which is comparable to an airplane's "black box," provides a continuous stream of data from the locomotive about train handling and fuel use. An accompanying GPS system allows tracking of locomotive positions on the network and dwell time within terminals. Implementation began in 2006 and more than 1,100 locomotives are expected to be equipped with ERAD by the end of 2007.
24
 
OPERATIONS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
Digital video cameras are being installed to record sights and sounds outside the locomotives. These cameras record the tracks ahead, including signal lights and rail crossings. The recordings provide information that will help CSX continue to improve grade crossing safety.
The company also uses process improvement teams that employ Six Sigma and Lean tools to improve the performance, effectiveness and cost of fundamental company processes. Employees undergo training to achieve Green Belt, Black Belt or Master Black Belt levels of excellence.
Since 2001, the process improvement teams have completed more than 500 projects, improving car and locomotive dwell, enhancing labor productivity and redesigning many other key processes of the company, creating nearly $400 million in operating expense value. Recent successes include:
The locomotive shutdown project, which reduced fuel waste from excessive locomotive idling and will save the company $26 million by year-end 2007.
The waybill suspense project, which eliminated failures in the billing- to-cash receipt process and created over $100 million of additional working capital.
The company now has embarked on a new initiative, Total Service Integration (TSI), to better align customer demands and CSX capabilities, ensuring that the company operates in the most efficient manner, in effect creating additional capacity on the network.
Under TSI, CSX evaluates customers' service requirements and determines the operational capabilities needed to develop a more efficient design for the service product. The objective is to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while offering better scheduled service to customers.
This intense focus on customer service has paid off well for the company. The most recent customer satisfaction survey that rates 15 aspects of service shows CSX's highest ranking ever in more than four years of study.
The continual drive for more efficient operations, as well as enhanced reliability and customer service, sets the stage for even better results in the future.

COAL, COKE
& IRON ORE
In 2006, coal, coke and iron ore revenues totaled almost $2.4 billion, nearly a $300 million or 14% increase compared to 2005. This volume represents 25% of CSX's total revenue. Revenue growth was supported by more than 80,000 additional carloads, or a 5% year-over-year increase. Increased prices and favorable market conditions resulted in an increase in revenue per car of 9%.
CSX delivered 202 million tons of coal, coke and iron ore in 1.9 million carloads to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants.
The company transports almost one-third of every ton of coal used for generating electricity in the areas served by CSX. More than 80% of all the coal handled by CSX is used for electricity generation in the United States. The continued demand for electrical power and the cost efficiency of coal-fired generation creates a favorable outlook for CSX as a coal transporter.
International growth in coal demand also provides an opportunity for incremental coal deliveries to the ocean terminals. In 2006, the export market accounted for 7% of CSX's coal carloads.
CSX is the largest coal transporter east of the Mississippi River, originating 162 million of the total 193 million tons handled. The remainder includes western-received coal, coke, iron ore and synthetic fuel moved between plants. CSX serves 130 mining operations and delivers to 137 different destinations. In 2006, a typical CSX coal loading week resulted in more than 300 unit trains or 30,000 carloads of coal and more than 40 trains or 4,000 carloads received from connecting rail carriers.
The Appalachian coal fields lie within the heart of CSX's 21,000-mile network. This network also includes:
The major coal export terminals at Mobile, Newport News and Baltimore; three coal terminals on the Great
Lakes including Ashtabula, Conneaut and Toledo; and some of the growing import facilities along the East Coast and Gulf Coast.
Access to the growing Illinois Basin coal fields and major interline connections to railroads originating western coal from both the Powder River Basin and Colorado.

COAL, COKE & IRON ORE
Outlook
Today coal is used to generate more than half of the nation's electricity. The U.S. Department of Energy projects U.S. coal production increases of 1.1% each year from 2005-2015 and nearly double that growth from 2015-2030. The total energy produced by coal for states east of the Mississippi River is projected to increase by 39% from 2005 to 2030.
Meeting that demand will require greater utilization of existing coal-fired plants and the building of new plants. More than 10 new coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in CSX's territory. These new plants are expected to use up to 25 million tons a year to meet growing energy demand.
While a small number of obsolete plants are expected to close, coal volumes should increase as coal-fired generation expands. In addition to the power plants, coal-to-liquid facilities are expected to come on line between 2015 and 2030 to help reduce dependence on non-U.S. fuel sources.
The company is well positioned for long-term growth in the coal market, benefiting from the continued growth in electricity, additional applications of coal and the substantial population growth in the southern region of CSX's territory.
Coal users are making great efforts to ensure technology, process and operating disciplines make coal environmentally compatible. Carbon constraints will impose additional expense on coal-fired generation plants, but more effective carbon capture methods are being developed. Coal users continue to invest billions of dollars in capital to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury.

CHEMICALS
CHEMICALS
More than 528,000 carloads of chemical commodities were shipped for customers during 2006. Plastics and related feedstocks, a wide array of petroleum products, liquefied petroleum gases (LPGs), specialty chemicals and glass manufacturing products represent some of the commodities handled.
The growing Southeast is rapidly becoming the cornerstone of CSX's chemical network. Since 2005, CSX has been successful in securing more than 6,000 annual carloads of new business associated with plant construction and expansions along the company's rail network, primarily in the Southeast.
The company's chemicals volumes declined by 1% in 2006. Double digit growth in the LPGs business, due in part to a new, streamlined CSX service to and from Sarnia, Ontario, helped minimize this decline. Yield management initiatives more than offset volume-related declines, as revenues grew by 11% during the same time period.
Market Highlights
Plastics represent 25% of CSX chemical carloads. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin market, which is driven by demand for plastic bottles and containers, is one of the fastest growing manufacturing segments in the country, increasing 7% to 10% a year. CSX handles more carloads of PET than any other North American railroad.
The CSX system reaches nearly 100 glass manufacturing plants, plastic pellet manufacturing plants and refineries, and more than 500 receivers of plastic pellets. In addition, the company provides the most comprehensive access to bulk transloading sites in North America through its TRANSFLO subsidiary. TRANSFLO enables chemical shippers to leverage the economics and productivity of bulk rail loadings to reach customers that are not rail served or lack volume to justify rail carloads.
Outlook
U.S. chemical manufacturing should remain stable over the next several years, despite the high price of natural gas and crude oil-based feedstocks. CSX expects moderate volume growth in chemicals over this time frame, contingent upon continued strength in U.S. manufacturing activity.
The company's plastics and plastics feedstock segments, and specifically the PET market, will drive the majority of volume growth over the next several years. Expansions by Southeastern-based PET resin producers are projected to increase CSX's carload volumes by more than 12,000 by 2010.
Two other emerging chemical markets, trona and biodiesel, are also expected to generate volume growth. Trona, the raw ingredient of soda ash, absorbs emissions from coal-fired utility plant boilers. As a result of the Clear Skies Act of 2002, trona is expected to grow from virtually no carloads in 2006 to approximately 1,500 annual carloads by 2010.
38
 
CHEMICALS
Biodiesel is created by blending petroleum-based diesel fuel and agriculture oils, such as soybean oil. Fewer than 800 carloads were shipped in 2006, but CSX expects more than 2,000 carloads in 2007, with additional growth to 2010 and beyond.
Overall, the company expects strong revenue growth based on modest volume growth and a continued strong pricing environment.

EMERGING MARKETS
EMERGING MARKETS
Emerging markets includes aggregates, processed materials, waste and machinery. This diverse mix of products generated more than 524,000 carloads with revenue of $580 million in 2006.
Aggregate shipments were strong, primarily due to increased spending on commercial and public works construction. CSX handled more than 290,000 carloads of crushed stone, sand and gravel.
The processed materials market experienced lower cement shipments in 2006, but demand for fly ash, slag and lime increased significantly. CSX serves numerous lime plants and connects producers with large power plants, steel mills, mining operations and water treatment facilities.
Municipal and construction waste shipments increased. This growth results from new direct rail service from a transfer station in Staten Island, N.Y., to South Carolina, and the development of rail service from the Northeast to a landfill in Kentucky.
Machinery shipments increased dramatically in 2006 as a result of more power generation projects. Traditionally, CSX handles gas turbines, generators and transformers. The nation's increased focus on renewable energy sources has caused a surge in demand for wind energy projects.
Wind energy components can generally move more economically and safely by rail. In addition, the company continues to meet the needs of the nation's military as materials and equipment are deployed.
TRANSFLO manages a network of more than 60 bulk transfer terminals in the eastern U.S. that enables customers not on the rail network to enjoy the benefits of rail. These terminals maintain the highest safety, customer service and handling standards.
Outlook
Commercial and public construction should continue to drive the demand for aggregate shipments. Growing domestic cement production will increase finished product shipments on rail, as well as require additional fly ash movement. CSX will handle more lime shipments as demand increases in key end-use markets, such as soil stabilization, steel production and waste water treatment. In addition, major producers are expanding production and expect to ship more lime on CSX.
Municipal solid waste, as well as construction and demolition debris, continue to represent key growth segments as additional rail-served landfills and transfer stations are developed within the company's service territory.
CSX will continue to be a major transportation provider for military equipment, as well as farm and construction machinery and power generation equipment, as the nation's transportation, food and energy demands increase.

PHOSPHATES & FERTILIZERS
PHOSPHATES & FERTILIZERS
With exclusive operations in one of the world's largest phosphate reserves, CSX leads the rail industry in phosphate and fertilizer volume, filling a critical role in global agricultural markets. CSX's extensive rail network serves four mines and five processing plants in Central Florida's 1,977-square-mile Bone Valley, the heart of Florida's phosphate-mining area, as well as six port facilities.
In 2006, phosphate and fertilizer revenues totaled $354 million, or approximately 4% of CSX's total revenue and 5% of total carloads. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year. About 80% of the phosphate used domestically and 25% used around the world originates in Florida.
Exporting from its own Tampa Bay terminal to global destinations, CSX also dispatches unit trains of processed phosphates and fertilizers to midwestern and Canadian farm belts via the Chicago gateway. About 66% of CSX's phosphate and fertilizer revenue comes from domestic shipments. The remaining 34% is exported, primarily to China, India and Australia.
The phosphates and fertilizers market includes three primary crop nutrients (nitrogen, phosphates and potash) and molten sulphur, which is used in the processing of phosphate rock.
CSX's strengths in the phosphate and fertilizer market include the following:
Service to six Tampa Bay port facilities, providing water access for exports and trans-Gulf shipments.
The CSX Rockport facility at the Port of Tampa, which has 100,000 tons of storage capacity, and handles approximately 2 million tons of exports a year.
Efficient shuttle train operations that move 22 million tons of phosphate rock and finished phosphate product among mines, processing plants and ports within the Bone Valley. Much of the equipment in this service cycles within 36 hours.
Access to an extensive network of 64 domestic fertilizer warehouses capable of handling unit trains.
An efficient, fast domestic phosphate unit train service from Central Florida to the Midwest within five days.
Access to nine import terminals for handling foreign-produced liquid and dry nitrogens. CSX is actively developing additional port and inland terminals to handle growing demand.
Beyond its extensive phosphate and fertilizer segment in Central Florida, CSX also serves many other important crop nutrient producers and consumers through its network and alliances with other carriers.
42
 
PHOSPHATES & FERTILIZERS
WITH EXCLUSIVE OPERATIONS IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PHOSPHATE RESERVES, CSX LEADS THE RAIL INDUSTRY IN PHOSPHATE AND FERTILIZER VOLUME.
Outlook
Consumer food and biofuel demand are primary drivers in the phosphate and fertilizer market. As population growth places more demand on food supplies and energy resources, farmers will need additional nutrient supplies to enhance crop yields. Fertilizer demand also will increase as farmers look to boost corn production for ethanol-based fuels.
While overall fertilizer shipment growth is expected to be moderate, CSX expects stronger near-term growth as U.S. corn plantings increase by nearly 15% in 2007, and U.S. nutrient use is expected to increase by 10%. With the amount of corn used for ethanol expected to double in the next three years, the U.S. will need to plant additional acres of corn and increase yields where possible.
The world supply and demand for phosphates has become balanced after a two-year period of lackluster demand. Several phosphate plant closures in the world combined with an estimated increase of 4.5% in world nutrient use will keep the U.S. producers well positioned for volume and margin growth in the near term.
Long term, CSX expects fertilizer shipment revenue and volume to grow, driven by an emphasis on efficient unit train distribution and industry-leading access to fertilizer-consuming regions of the Midwest. CSX has access to 64 dedicated unit train facilities in the U.S., and this total is expected to grow by 15% in the next three years.

FOREST PRODUCTS
FOREST PRODUCTS
Forest products represented more than 8% of CSX's total revenue in 2006. The company shed more than 35,000 carloads of under-performing business in 2006, boosting per-car revenues by 17%.
CSX, a primary partner of the North American forest products industry, provides service to more than 90 pulp and paper mills, 50 lumber mills, 40 building materials mills and 30 panel mills. The railroad also serves numerous printing facilities, box plants and distribution centers for major home improvement retailers.
The network's span reaches every segment of the forest products market east of the Mississippi River. CSX's extensive network, combined with the long-term relationships forged between suppliers and receivers, makes CSX an industry leader in forest products.
Close alliances with other carriers allow CSX to enhance its market presence within the forest products industry, including inbound shipments of Canadian lumber and panel product, and wood pulp and paper originating in Wisconsin, New England and eastern Canada. CSX ships pulp and paper products to western destinations, including California.
CSX's extensive network, combined with the long-term relationships forged between suppliers and receivers, makes csx an industry leader in forest products.
Outlook
The U.S. housing market continues to correct after several years of rapid growth. Until new home inventories are reduced, the short-term demand for lumber and other construction materials is expected to remain soft. Once the housing market stabilizes, CSX's strong presence in the Southeast will position the company for long-term growth.
Growth of electronic media continues to negatively affect the newsprint market, with U.S. consumption dropping an average of 6% per year. Domestic printing paper production also is declining as imports grow and industry consolidation efforts continue.
The containerboard, packaging and wood pulp industries located on CSX's network remain in a strong position, with any variations tied to economic conditions.
Working with other carriers, CSX offers customers an updated and expanded fleet of flat cars specifically designed for the lumber and panel markets. National pooling programs also enable CSX to increase the flexibility and efficiency of the boxcar fleet for paper handling.
With the trucking industry facing higher fuel and insurance costs, tighter emission standards, increased congestion and revised driver regulations, CSX is in a favorable position to capture a greater share of this market.

METALS
METALS
Metals generates 7% of CSX's revenue. In 2006, metals revenue reached a record $673 million, representing revenue growth of 18% on volume that grew 1% compared to 2005. Fueled by heavy demand for steel at home and abroad, CSX serves more than 800 metals customers and reaches more metal-producing states in the East than any other carrier.
The CSX metals business is comprised of seven key market segments: ferrous scrap; sheet steel; semi-finished; plate; pipe; bar-rod; and structural and non-ferrous products. Ferrous scrap and sheet steel account for 63% of the metals revenue base.
Through its network, CSX transports:
More ferrous scrap than any other transportation provider in North America.
Sheet steel from all the major producers to processing facilities and key end-use markets, including steel warehouses serving the automotive and appliance industries.
Millions of tons of bar, coiled rod and structural steel annually for the construction industry.
Hundreds of thousands of tons per year of alumina, ferro-alloy and other raw materials to aluminum and steel producers.
CSX also provides specialized services like MetalNet, through which the company establishes relationships with a network of metals warehouses that provides rail service to non-rail served customers.
While the majority of metals shipped are domestically produced, the market has become more global. China's need for steel is creating unprecedented scrap demand, which is being filled through U.S. East Coast sources. This demand requires domestic mills to draw on scrap supply from inland producers, which in turn, generates substantial long-haul opportunities for CSX.
Additionally, CSX offers multifaceted solutions to further capture the expanding global opportunities.
Outlook
Overall steel demand remains strong domestically and globally. The current domestic automotive and housing softness will continue over the near term, but is expected to be offset by greater demand in the energy and non-residential construction markets.
Industry consolidations, which have added greater stability and discipline to the metals market, will continue. Domestic steel mills are now more focused on maintaining a balance between supply and demand, with
46
 
METALS
the result that steel product prices have become less volatile. New mill capacity is developing to meet expanding energy and southern automotive markets.
In addition, Asian steel output and demand are expected to remain strong. However, U.S. steel imports are expected to decline given the dollar's relative weakness, rising vessel costs and China's efforts to slow steel exports.
The metals market should continue to enjoy significant success on both the demand and pricing fronts. Growth is expected to continue, but the pace of this growth could ease if interest rates rise and the economy slows.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS
Agricultural products represented approximately 7%, or $681 million, of CSX's total revenue in 2006. Volume growth in 2006 reflected gains in ethanol, feed grains, soybeans and export shipments.
Revenues grew nearly 24% in 2006 based on strength across all commodity lines, but particularly in ethanol shipments transported to the Northeast and export grain shipments. Improved yield management strategies in soybeans and feed ingredients also contributed to revenue growth.
Domestic shipments comprise the majority of CSX's agricultural traffic. Within the agricultural products group are two distinct markets: whole grains, such as corn, soybeans and wheat; and processed grain products, such as feed ingredients, flour, edible oils, corn sweeteners and ethanol.
Transporting more than 21 million tons of grain annually, CSX serves more than 400 grain elevators in the Midwest and supplies more than half the feed used by the livestock industry in the Southeast.
In the processed grain products market, ethanol is growing significantly, as both production and consumption of this gasoline-saving fuel additive grows dramatically.
CSX offers particular strengths to the agricultural market, including:
Service to grain elevators throughout the Midwest, primarily in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
Service to more than 100 feed mills in the Southeast.
Access to more than 15 grain processing facilities, as well as a number of bakeries and soft drink production facilities throughout the East.
Outlook
Demand for agricultural products is expected to strengthen steadily over the next three years, primarily driven by growth in feed grains from new and expanded feed mills on CSX routes.
A promising emerging market continues to be ethanol. As the country continues to develop renewable fuels related to ethanol production, demand for rail transport in coming years should continue to grow.

FOOD & CONSUMER
FOOD & CONSUMER
Food and consumer contributed $477 million, or approximately 5% of CSX's 2006 revenues. Revenues were up more than 9% over 2005 despite a 2% reduction in shipments, driven primarily by a slowdown in the housing sector.
CSX transports the food, beverages, building products and appliances that end up in local grocery stores, fast food establishments and other retail destinations across the nation. Much of the company's annual volume reflects domestic shipments, with a growing number of consumer goods originating in Mexico.
Key components of the food and consumer market are:
Dry grocery goods, which include beverages, canned goods and dry packaged goods. This category accounted for 25% of 2006 shipments for the food and consumer group.
Transportation equipment, including new locomotives, railcars and wheel sets. Building products, including roofing granule. Refrigerated products.
Clay and ores, primarily used for the manufacture of housing-related materials and paint.
Consumer products, including manufactured goods and appliances.
CSX is well positioned to serve the growing demand for these diverse products, in some cases through partnerships with other transportation companies:
Numerous processing plants that produce food and beverage products, building products, appliances and other consumer products are located directly on CSX lines.
CSX serves a large network of warehouses that customers use to transfer products to their final destinations by truck.
CSX links beverage producers and appliance manufacturers in Mexico with eastern U.S. markets through interline rail connections.
In late 2006, CSX introduced a new, state-of-the-art service to transport fruits and vegetables from producer markets in the state of Washington to key consumer markets in the Northeast. This new five-day service features loading and unloading inside cooled facilities, maintaining the temperatures needed to preserve these perishables.
The refrigerated boxcars used for this service are a new generation of 64-foot railcars with enhanced insulation, energy-efficient cooling systems and GPS monitoring to ensure proper temperature control. This innovative service creates cost-effective options for shippers of perishable goods who have traditionally relied on trucks to meet their transportation needs.

FOOD & CONSUMER
CSX TRANSPORTS THE FOOD, BEVERAGES, BUILDING PRODUCTS AND APPLIANCES THAT END UP IN LOCAL GROCERY STORES, FAST FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS AND OTHER RETAIL DESTINATIONS ACROSS THE NATION.
Outlook
The U.S. housing market continues to slump after several years of rapid growth. Until new home inventories are reduced to more sustainable levels, the short-term demand for wallboard, brick and other building materials is expected to remain soft.
Food and beverage markets are expected to consolidate, spurring rail traffic growth between food processors and distributors, with a continued emphasis on the forward positioning of products and inventory management.
Reflecting higher levels of investment by major national and regional railroads, transportation equipment deliveries are expected to remain strong.
In total, the food and consumer group should grow at a steady pace over the longer term, as CSX's innovative service offerings promote conversion of traffic from highways to rail.

INTERMODAL
Major truckload carriers are increasingly working hand-in-hand with CSX, converting their constrained driver supply to cover short-haul pickups and deliveries, while relying on railroads to service the long-haul portion of the route. Intermodal provides an attractive, secure and environmentally friendly alternative for those companies moving freight within CSX's rail network, alleviating the need for costly backhauls and driver repositions, while offering additional capacity solutions utilizing Intermodal containers and truck operations.
Outlook
Global demand is continuing to shift production to China, supporting the growth of containerized imports by over 50% in the past 5 years. Imports are expected to grow nearly 5% per year through 2020, with China and India dominating that growth. Many of the major East Coast ports have either begun or completed dredging and expansion projects to accommodate this projected growth.
As the ports prepare for growth, Intermodal is mobilizing to capture that growth and collaborating with the major East Coast ports to either establish or aggressively expand on-dock and near-dock intermodal service to enhance the range of destinations offered to customers and to further reduce highway congestion around the ports.
Intermodal is targeting new international import traffic, improving its connections with western railroads and working with trucking companies who are increasingly expanding their business models to include intermodal shipments. Terminal expansions and strategic infrastructure developments by the railroad are also driving Intermodal's ability to meet market needs and grow profitably.
In February 2007, CSX launched a new service in cooperation with Burlington Northern Santa Fe to provide a high-volume rail intermodal corridor between California and Atlanta, Ga. Initially offering one intermodal train each day, volume is expected to grow with the overall expansion of the West Coast to Southeast intermodal market.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), an independent provider of proxy voting and corporate governance services, recently reported that, in July 2007, CSX's corporate governance quotient was better than 86% of the companies in the S&P 500 and 98% of the companies in the transportation industry in corporate governance practices.
The Board has adopted corporate governance guidelines that reflect the high standards and core values that those who deal with the company - employees, investors, customers, vendors, communities and regulators - can expect from CSX. These guidelines include the qualification criteria for director candidates and the authority of each Board committee to retain outside, independent advisors and consultants when appropriate.

CALCULATION OF CERTAIN NON - GAAP MEASURES
CALCULATION
OF CERTAIN NON - GAAP MEASURES
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the company's business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. Additionally, CSX's definitions below may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is calculated by taking cash from operations and subtracting property additions and certain other investing activities. These other investing activities include proceeds from sale of businesses, insurance proceeds and other items. Also, added to free cash flow is CSX's 42% economic interest in Conrail's free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts. Other deposits, which are included in cash provided by operating activities, are not included in the Company's free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that are set aside for certain future debt payments. Management believes that free cash flow is important in evaluating the company's financial performance and measures the ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing.
Return on Invested Capital
Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income after taxes by invested capital. Adjusted operating income is calculated by eliminating the impact of interest and certain one-time items to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted operating income is then decreased for income taxes at a standard 38% tax rate. Invested capital consists of debt, common stock, and the net present value of CSX operating leases offset by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Management believes that this metric is an important measure for evaluating the company's return on its capital investments, relative to its cost of capital.
All-in Debt to Capital
All-in debt to capital is calculated by adding the net present value of CSX operating leases to total balance sheet debt and dividing the total by all-in capital. All-in capital is all-in debt plus shareholders' equity. This non-GAAP measure is presented because management believes that total debt plus operating leases are relevant in assessing the company's total leverage relative to its overall capital structure.
Funds from Operations to Adjusted Debt
This ratio is calculated by dividing Funds from Operations by Adjusted Debt as CSX believes Standard & Poor's ("S&P") defines it. Funds from Operations consists of net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for certain items such as: insurance proceeds included in operating activities, certain non-cash tax benefits or charges, changes in operating assets and liabilities, operating lease principal reductions (defined as the annual change in the net present value of operating leases), Conrail free cash flow and after-tax debt repurchase expense.
Adjusted debt consists of total balance sheet debt adjusted for the company's unfunded pension obligation and off-balance sheet debt, using the S&P approach to calculating the net present value of operating leases. This non-GAAP measure is presented because management believes it is a good indicator of the company's ability to service its debt over time.
Retained Cash Flow to Adjusted Debt
This ratio is calculated by dividing Retained Cash Flow by Adjusted Debt as CSX believes Moody's defines it. Retained Cash Flow consists of net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for certain items such as: insurance proceeds included in operating activities, certain non-cash tax benefits or charges, changes in operating assets and liabilities, operating lease principal reductions (defined as two-thirds of rent expense on operating leases), dividends paid, CSX's 42% economic interest in Conrail's free cash flow and after-tax debt repurchase expense.
Adjusted debt consists of total balance sheet debt adjusted for the company's unfunded pension obligation and off-balance sheet debt using the Moody's approach of six times rent expense on operating leases. Like the Funds from Operations to Debt ratio, this non-GAAP ratio is a good indicator of the company's ability to service its debt over time.

CALCULATION OF CERTAIN NON - GAAP MEASURES
Free Cash Flow
The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure). Historically, CSX had included dividends paid to shareholders in its calculation of free cash flow. In the table below and going forward, CSX will calculate free cash flow before dividends paid to shareholders as dividends do not directly impact CSX's ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. The calculation of free cash flow is as follows:

CSX believes Standard and Poor (S&P) calculates the above items as follows:
Principal reduction of operating leases: Change in the net present value of operating leases Off balance sheet debt: Net present value of operating leases
(a) Changes in operating assets and liabilities are calculated from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements (b) Total balance sheet debt includes short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt (c) Calculated on an annual basis, so the last 12 months' balance of $564 reflects the ending 2006 balance

CSX believes Moody's calculates the above items as follows:
Principal reduction of operating leases: Two-thirds of rent expense on operating leases Off balance sheet debt: Six times rent expense on operating leases
(a) Changes in operating assets and liabilities are calculated from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements (b) Total balance sheet debt includes short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt (c) Calculated on an annual basis, so the last 12 months' balance of $564 reflects the ending 2006 balance
(d) Off balance sheet debt primarily reflects the present value of remaining lease obligations. The Moody's-style amount is six times all rent expense, which produces a much larger debt balance primarily because rent includes car hire, which was $355 million in 2006.
Car hire generally is not a continuing financial obligation of the company absent a related freight car movement.

Freight Car Fleet
To help the company provide on-time and safe delivery for its customers, the railroad will spend more than $78 million on its freight car fleet in 2007. The average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 225,000 cars, including about 117,000 cars that are privately owned by shippers and about 39,000 foreign (other railroad marked) cars. Daily interchange with other rail carriers consists of tens of thousands of cars to and from CSX for transport to final destinations.
On any given day, about 225,000 freight cars occupy the railroad's network, delivering approximately 7.4 million carloads of products and raw materials annually. Intermodal represents nearly 2.2 million loads, while the remaining nearly 5.2 million carloads are handled in CSX's merchandise, coal and auto networks.
CSX provides specialized equipment to deliver merchandise and raw materials from the source to distributors or end users:
Gondolas make up the bulk of the CSX fleet at 29% and primarily support the metals markets. Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for protecting products like coil and sheet steel.
Open-top hoppers represent 20% of CSX's fleet with 20,447 cars. These freight cars serve primarily the coal, coke and iron ore markets and also aggregates and other bulk commodities.
Boxcars account for 15% of the CSX fleet and include a variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and building materials. Insulated boxcars deliver food products, canned goods, beer and wine.
Covered hoppers, totaling 15,256 cars, or 15% of the CSX fleet, are segregated based upon commodity density. Lighter bulk commodities use larger cubic capacity "jumbo covered hoppers" for grain, fertilizers, flour, clay and lime. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in "small cube covered hoppers."
Multi-level railcars handle finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels: bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs, and tri-levels for sedans and smaller automobiles. CSX controls 12,548 units, two-thirds of which are bi-levels.
Flat cars transport bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.
Other cars on the network include: center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products, flat cars for shipping intermodal containers and trailers, and bulk and finished goods, such as lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.

Locomotives
The railroad operates 3,853 total locomotives, owned or leased long term, including 2,489 road and freight locomotives, 1,175 yard and local service locomotives and 189 auxiliary units (used to produce extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain).
The railroad focuses on maximum use of its fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the company's Surface Transportation system. Better locomotive management helps the company move freight more efficiently, while continued investment in the company's power source means the railroad is operating more locomotives better than ever.
The fleet will receive 200 high-horsepower units in 2007, in addition to the 100 locomotives added in 2006. These newer locomotives meet the Clean Air Act's emission standards and offer more fuel efficiency and greater reliability than earlier models. As a result, 150 leased units will be retired.
