Surface Transportation Highlights:
 
    Double-digit gains in operating income
    Operating ratio improves on higher productivity and efficiency
    Strong safety and customer service performance
 
 CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported third quarter 2007 net earnings of $407 million, or 91 cents per share, including 24 cents per share from discontinued operations.  In the same quarter last year, the company reported earnings of $328 million, or 71 cents per share, including 17 cents per share from insurance gains and the resolution of certain tax matters.  On a comparable basis, excluding these items, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24 percent on a year-over-year basis.  (See table below for reconciliation of quarter items to reported numbers.)
Jacksonville, Florida (Oct. 16, 2007)
 
Our core earning power continues to improve in a more challenging transportation environment, said Michael Ward, chairman, president and CEO.  The CSX team delivered exceptional levels of safety and service for our customers and excellent third quarter results that build on the superior value we have delivered for our shareholders over the last three years.
 
Third quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, a 3 percent increase over the third quarter of 2006. This increase was driven by an 8 percent improvement in revenue per unit, more than offsetting the 4 percent decline in volume.
 
The companys Surface Transportation businesses recorded third quarter operating income of $552 million versus $489 million in the same quarter last year.  Both quarters included insurance recoveries of $1 million and $15 million, respectively. On a comparable basis, excluding the insurance recoveries, operating income rose 16 percent on a year-over-year basis.
 
Continued improvements in safety, service and productivity combined to help improve the companys operating ratio to 78 percent for the quarter. This represents a 240 basis point improvement on a comparable basis from the same period last year.
 
With our financial results improving on a sustained basis, we are targeting nearly $5 billion of investment in our transportation network over the next three years, said Ward.  These investments will position us to meet the pressing transportation needs of our nation in a way that reduces highway congestion and supports the environment.  When we do this, we create long-term value for shareholders, and that value is enhanced in the near term when we return capital through dividends and repurchases.  This balanced approach to value creation is serving our shareholders very well.

GAAP Reconciliation
1
 
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
 
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided Surface Transportation operating income and earnings per share adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.
 
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided above. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
CSX recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 million and $15 million for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gains represent insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
In the third quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Companys pre-filing agreement, which is an early review of specific transactions.  The company recorded an income tax benefit of $110 million in the third quarter of 2007, primarily associated with the resolution of income tax matters related to former activities of the container shipping and marine service businesses.   This third quarter benefit is recorded as discontinued operations as the Company no longer is active in these businesses.  This benefit is associated with tax basis adjustments, foreign dividends and foreign tax credits from operations over a multi-year period.

Third quarter 2007 Surface Transportation revenue represents over five years of quarter-over-quarter revenue gains.  Improved pricing due to the competitive advantage of rail-based transportation solutions and high levels of customer service continued to be the primary drivers of revenue gains offsetting weakness in housing construction and related markets.
Merchandise
 Revenue and revenue per unit increases were driven by continued yield management improvements.  While overall volume was down, there were increases in biodiesel and chemicals used in plastics production.  These gains were more than offset by volume declines in chlorine, plastics and petroleum product shipments.
Chemicals
 Revenue and revenue per unit improved through positive mix changes including an increase in high revenue per unit shipments in military traffic and higher demand in the domestic cement markets due to a reduction in imported cement.  Total volume declined primarily due to lower aggregate shipments, which include crushed stone, sand and gravel, as a result of continued weakness in residential construction.
Emerging Markets
 Revenue was down even with continued yield management initiatives which led to gains in revenue per unit.  Volume declines were seen in lumber and panel shipments driven by the downturn in residential construction.  Volumes were also negatively affected by lower paper production due to electronic media substitution.
Forest Products
 Pricing gains drove increases in revenue and revenue per unit.  Continued growth in ethanol and feed ingredients were more than offset by weak grain and export volumes driven by higher commodity prices and an increased Southeastern crop which lessened the need for long-haul rail transportation.
Agricultural Products
 Volume was down as a result of steel production decreases for the quarter primarily due to weakness in the housing market.  This decline was partially offset by strength in steel exports and increased scrap metal shipments due to inventory replenishment.
Metals
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Lower global demand for domestically produced phosphates led to lower volume.  This decline was partially offset by higher fertilizer shipments due to increased demand for corn from ethanol products.  Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to pricing and changes in traffic mix.
 Volume declines in the quarter were driven by decreased demand for building products and reduced shipments of transportation equipment.  Revenue per unit increases were driven by continued pricing gains due to improved service.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Positive revenue and revenue per unit were influenced by favorable pricing efforts. Volume declined slightly as increased exports were more than offsetby utility inventories at target levels and a resulting decrease in domestic coal shipments.
 
Automotive
Revenue and revenue per unit improved as a result of continued focus on yield management. Volume gains were driven by an increase in year-over-year North American light vehicle production.
Other Rail Revenue
The primary driver of this positive change was the increase in revenue generated by the companys affiliated businesses.
 
 
Intermodal
 Volumes were lower primarily due to the termination of certain customer contracts, losses due to select steamship carriers withdrawing from certain markets and slower growth from Aisan markets. Also, volume was impacted by the closing of a terminal facility earlier this year.  Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit decreased due to unfavorable mix changes.
International
 Revenue and volumes increased due to a new shorter-haul train service.  The unfavorable mix impact on revenue per unit from this new traffic more than offset price gains in the remaining domestic business.
Domestic
9
 
Surface Transportation expenses increased $20 million from last years third quarter.  Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased $10 million primarily due to the effect of inflation. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in train crew headcount due to lower volume and productivity gains from improved operations.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $6 million primarily due to inflation. The increase was mostly offset by a decrease in costs associated with the reduction in train accidents and related costs reflecting continued improvement in safety performance.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expenseincreased $5 million due to higher fuel prices, mostly offset by increased fuel efficiency as well as lower volume.
Fuel
 
expense increased $7 million. A larger asset base related to higher capital spending was partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from an equipment life study completed earlier this year.
Depreciation
expense decreased $19 million due to lower volumes and better asset utilization driven by operational fluidity reflected in lower shipment cycle times and cars-on-line measurements.
Equipment and Other Rents
of $1 millionrepresents insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina property damage and lost profits.  The $14 million decrease from last years quarter is due to timing of cash receipts.
