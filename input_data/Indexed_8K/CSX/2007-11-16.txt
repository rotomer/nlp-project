GAAP Reconciliation Disclosure
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the Companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the Securities and Exchange Commission may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In certain information that is publicly available, CSX has provided non-GAAP financial measures.  This information is provided because the Companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these non-GAAP measures.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information.  Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations.  A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.  Additionally, CSXs definitions may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
These slides should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Historically, CSX had included dividends paid to shareholders in its calculation of free cash flow.  In the table above and going forward, CSX will calculate free cash flow before dividends paid to shareholders as dividends do not directly impact CSXs ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing.
