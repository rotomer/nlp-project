Fourth Quarter and Full Year
Surface Transportation Highlights:
      Best-ever safety and customer service performance
 
Jacksonville, Florida (Jan. 22, 2008)
 CSX Corporation [NYSE: CSX] today reported fourth quarter 2007 net earnings of $
365
million, or 86 cents per share, including a penny per share from insurance gains.  In the fourth quarter of last year, the company reported earnings of $347 million, or 75 cents per share, including 18 cents per share from insurance gains, a gain on Conrail property
 
and the resolution of certain tax matters. On a
reported
basis, earnings per share increased
15%
percent on a year-over-year basis.
Once again, CSX delivered outstanding financial gains for our shareholders through strong improvements in safety, service and productivity, said Michael Ward, chairman, president and CEO.  These improvements reflect the value we are delivering for our customers, the continued momentum in our business and the strong fundamentals of our industry in an evolving transportation marketplace.
The companys Surface Transportation businesses produced record fourth quarter operating income of $609 million versus $505 million in the same quarter last year. These results included insurance
gains
of $8 million and $27 million, respectively. On a comparable basis, excluding the insurance gains, operating income rose 26 percent on a year-over-year basis. 
  (See table below for reconciliation of quarter items to reported numbers.)
The significant increase in operating income resulted from strong revenue growth and productivity improvements that allowed CSX to overcome the impact of higher fuel prices
.  In addition, the sustained improvements in the companys safety record resulted in a
favorable personal injury reserve adjustment
for the quarter.
Full-Year Revenues Break $10 Billion Mark; Operating Ratio Best in a Decade
CSX reported full-year 2007 earnings per share of $2.99, including 29 cents per share from discontinued operations and insurance gains.  In 2006, the company reported full-year earnings per share of $2.82, including 60 cents from insurance gains, a gain on Conrail property and the resolution of certain tax matters.  On a comparable basis, excluding these items, earnings per share increased 22 percent on a year-over-year basis.  (See table below for reconciliation of full-year items to reported numbers.)
Earnings growth in 2007 was supported by Surface Transportation revenues that exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the companys history, and record Surface Transportation operating income of more than $2.2 billion. The companys operating ratio for the full year improved to its best level in a decade.
By nearly every measure of safety, customer service and financial performance, CSX is the fastest-improving company in an attractive rail industry.  In fact, we now rank among the industrys best companies in safety and service, said Ward.  Our performance has generated significant shareholder value and has led to the highest share price gain of any major North American railroad in the past three years.
With momentum in the companys performance, a strong outlook for rail transportation, and the benefits of key investments in its network, management today reaffirmed its long-term financial targets, which include
double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share, as well as a mid- to low 70s operating ratio and free cash flow before dividends of $800 million to $1 billion by 2010.
Our employees are continually raising the bar and creating shareholder value in both the short-term and long-term while
meeting the nations pressing transportation needs in ways that are good for
the environment and the economy,
said Ward.
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services. The companys transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.

GAAP Reconciliation
1
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the SEC may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided Surface Transportation operating income and earnings per share adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided above. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.
Forward-looking statements
This press release and other statements by the company contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act with respect to, among other items: projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, cost-savings, expenses, or other financial items; statements of managements plans, strategies and objectives for future operation, and managements expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; statements concerning proposed new products and services; and statements regarding future economic, industry or market conditions or performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as believe, expect, anticipate, project, estimate and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual performance or results could differ materially from that anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements include, among others: (i) the companys success in implementing its financial and operational initiatives; (ii) changes in domestic or international economic or business conditions, including those affecting the rail industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation); (iii) legislative or regulatory changes; (iv) the inherent business risks associated with safety and security; and (v) the outcome of claims and litigation involving or affecting the company.

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
CSX recognized a pre-tax gain of $8 million and $27 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the years 2007 and 2006, the pre-tax gain was $27 million and $168 million, respectively. These gains represent insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina property damage and lost profits. Additional gains are expected in future periods as more cash is collected.
In the fourth quarter of 2006, CSX recognized an income tax benefit of $41 million, principally related to the resolution of  federal income tax audits. For the year 2006, CSX recognized $151 million of income tax benefits, principally related to the resolution of certain tax matters.
In the third quarter of 2007, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the companys pre-filing agreement, which is an early review of specific transactions.  The company recorded an income tax benefit of $110 million in the third quarter of 2007, primarily associated with the resolution of income tax matters related to former activities of the container shipping and marine service businesses.  This benefit is recorded as discontinued operations as the company is no longer active in these businesses.  This benefit is associated with tax basis adjustments, foreign dividends, and foreign tax credits from operations over a multi-year period. 
The decrease in Other Capital was primarily driven by $2.1 billion of share repurchases in 2007, partially offset by stock option exercises and the conversion of convertible debt to equity.

Fourth quarter 2007 Surface Transportation revenue represents nearly six years of consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue gains.  The Company was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that rail based solutions provide versus other modes of transportation. These pricing gains, and higher fuel recovery, more than offset volume weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production, and related markets.
Merchandise
 Revenue and revenue-per-unit increases were driven primarily by improved pricing and a higher fuel surcharge rate.  Volume was down slightly primarily due to weakness in propane volumes caused by a slow start to the winter heating season.
Chemicals
 Revenue per unit improved on a higher fuel surcharge rate and reduced shipments of lower revenue per unit aggregate shipments, which include crushed stone, sand and gravel, as a result of continued weakness in residential construction.
Emerging Markets
 Revenue and volume declined due to continued weakness in residential construction.  Volumes were also negatively affected by lower paper production due to electronic media substitution.
Forest Products
 
 Gains in price and fuel surcharge coverage drove increases in revenue and revenue per unit.  Volume growth was due to increased shipments of feed grains and wheat. Additionally, ethanol volumes rose substantially as a result of expanded use in the Northeast.
Agricultural Products
 Improved pricing and focus on longer-haul opportunities continue to drive revenue and revenue per unit increases.  Volumes were down due to lower steel production resulting from weakness in the automotive market.
Metals
 Revenue increased due to continued yield management initiatives, and a rise in long-haul, high revenue per unit, shipments of fertilizer.  Continued strength in fertilizer volumes was driven by higher demand for corn used in ethanol production.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
 Volume and revenue declines were due to weakness in building product demand and reduced shipments of transportation equipment.  Revenue-per-unit increases were driven by continued pricing initiatives within the clay and ore markets.
Food and Consumer
Coal
Sustained growth in yield and improved fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit.Volume increased in the export market due to strong overseas demand and a weak U.S. dollar.  These gains were offset by continued weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels. Overall, volumes were flat as higher capacity cars allowed the movement of more tons with fewer cars.
 
Automotive
 
Volume was down due to a decline in vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment.  Revenue per unit improved due to a higher fuel surcharge rate.
 
Intermodal Operating Revenue
 Revenue-per-unit increases in the fourth quarter were driven by fuel recovery, yield management initiatives, and favorable mix.  Revenue and volume were down due to slower growth of imports and losses of several accounts in previous quarters.
International
 The continued growth of new shorter-haul train service positively influenced domestic revenue and volume.  Volume also grew by the opening of a new terminal.  Revenue per unit declined as higher fuel recovery was more than offset by the mix impact of this new shorter-haul service.
Domestic
 
10
CSX Corporation
 
Surface Transportation expenses increased $77 million from last years fourth quarter.  Significant variances are described below.
expenses increased only $6 million.  These expenses were basicallyflat primarily due to a reduction in headcount from lower volume and productivity gains related to improved operations.  These savings were offset by the effects of inflation and other employee benefit costs.
Labor and Fringe
 
 
 
expenses decreased $29 million. The primary driver was a decrease of $56 million related to a change in estimate for personal injury reserves offset by increased environmental costs. This net favorable change was partially offset by train accident costs and inflation.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expenseincreased $86 million due to higher fuel prices, somewhat offset by increased fuel efficiency as well as lower volume.
Fuel
 
expense increased $4 million. A larger asset base related to higher capital spending was mostly offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from asset life studies.
Depreciation
 
expense decreased $11 million due to lower volumes and better asset utilization driven by operational fluidity reflected in lower shipment cycle times and cars-on-line measurements.
Equipment and Other Rents
of $8 millionrepresents insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina property damage and lost profits.  The $19 million decrease from last years quarter is due to timing of cash receipts.
