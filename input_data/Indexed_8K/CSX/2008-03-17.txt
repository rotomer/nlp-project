HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
Demonstrating confidence in the earning power, performance and momentum of its business, CSX Corporation today provided 2008 earnings guidance, raised its long-term guidance through 2010, and announced additional actions to continue delivering value to shareholders through enhanced dividends and share repurchases.
Jacksonville, FL  March 17, 2008 
 
CSX is an industry leader in virtually every key measure of safety, customer service and financial improvement.  Our Board and management team have driven top-tier stock returns in the industry and among the S&P 500 over the past one, three and five years, said Michael J. Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  The actions announced today reflect our high level of confidence in our ability to continue delivering superior value for all shareholders.
2008 GUIDANCE
CSX expects to report earnings per share (EPS) of 74 cents to 77 cents for the first quarter of 2008, a 42 percent to 48 percent increase compared to reported EPS of 52 cents in the first quarter of 2007.  Building on this momentum, CSX also expects to report full-year 2008 EPS of $3.40 to $3.60, representing a 24 percent to 31 percent increase compared to reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.74 in 2007.  The first quarter and full-year guidance includes a gain from a sale of real estate of four cents per share.
The first quarter and full-year guidance reflects the resiliency of the companys diverse portfolio of business, strong pricing resulting from customer service improvements, and greater productivity and efficiencies in CSXs operations.
 
 
 
LONG-TERM GUIDANCE
Based on the strong momentum that is expected to continue beyond 2008, the company also raised its long-term guidance through 2010, including:
 
 
RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS
The following actions are designed to deliver additional value to shareholders:
 
 
We remain committed to maximizing value for all shareholders through strategic investment, share repurchases and dividends while maintaining our investment grade credit profile, said Oscar Munoz, executive vice president and chief financial officer.  Our approach strikes the right balance between shareholders who want substantial value in both the short- and long-term, and customers who depend on our transportation network to deliver reliable service now and in the future.
Through its share repurchase program, CSX will repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions, using the companys available cash, free cash flow and incremental debt.  The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by the companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors.  In addition, the program could be suspended or discontinued at any time, based on market, economic or business conditions.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today announced that it has filed a lawsuit against The Childrens Investment Fund (TCI) and 3G Capital Partners (3G) alleging violations of federal securities laws.  TCI and 3G are hedge funds that have formed a group to nominate a slate of directors to stand for election at the 2008 CSX annual meeting.
Jacksonville, FL  March 17, 2008
Today CSX filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of federal securities laws, including violations of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that TCI has employed swap agreements in order to evade the filing requirements of Section 13(d), and that TCI's disclosures concerning its 11.5 percent swap position in CSX shares are materially misleading because they fail to disclose that, by virtue of agreements, understandings or relationships
with TCI, swap counterparties intend to vote CSX shares in accordance with TCI's wishes.
The lawsuit further alleges that TCI and 3G's disclosures concerning their formation of a Section 13(d) group are false and misleading and, therefore, material information that the investing public should have regarding the group and its intentions with respect to the Company is currently unavailable.
Edward J. Kelly, III, presiding director of the CSX Board of Directors stated, By virtually all measures the performance of CSX has been exceptional.  Notwithstanding this, in an effort to avoid the disruption and expense of a proxy contest weve spoken with TCI on a number of occasions in an attempt to find common ground.  Based on these conversations the Board concluded that TCI is not simply interested in having a representative voice on the Board, but instead is seeking to achieve effective control of the CSX Board of Directors and dictate Company strategy.
Because CSX believes the integrity of voting in its shares could be undermined by the violations of the TCI/3G group, the company has rescheduled the 2008 annual shareholder meeting to allow an opportunity to pursue this matter and provide adequate time for full and complete information to be made available to shareholders.  The CSX 2008 annual meeting of shareholders will be held in New Orleans on June 25, 2008.  The close of business on April 21, 2008 is the new record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the 2008 annual meeting.
 
 
 
"We filed this suit against TCI and 3G to ensure that all of our shareholders receive complete and accurate information about the group's holdings, agreements, plans and motivations to which they are entitled under federal securities laws," said Michael Ward, CSX chairman, president and CEO. "We are committed to protecting the interests of all CSX shareholders and continuing to execute on our successful and proven strategy to further enhance value."

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff CSX Corporation (CSX), by its undersigned counsel, alleges upon knowledge as to itself and its own acts and, unless otherwise specifically stated, upon information and belief as to all other matters, as follows:
 
1.           CSX brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against defendants in connection with its annual meeting scheduled for June 25, 2008.  Defendants plan to elect a slate of nominees to CSXs board of directors and amend CSXs Amended and Restated Bylaws in order to make In carrying out their plan, defendants have violated Sections 13(d) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder.

2.           The securities laws require defendants to disclose information that shareholders need to make decisions with respect to their investment.  13(dbeneficialownershipact as a group for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities of an issuer, such group shall be deemed a person and be required to make disclosures within 10 days of collectively acquiring more than 5 percent of the issuers stock. Similarly, Section 14(a) of the 34 Act and Rule 14a-9 prohibit any person from soliciting proxies on the basis of false and misleading information in order to enable shareholders to make an informed choice when voting their proxies.

as to the number of shares beneficially owned, any

3.           Defendants are attempting to change or influence control of CSX.  Defendants employed sophisticated derivative transactions with financial counterparties (swaps or swap arrangements) and secretly coordinated efforts with respect to their interests in CSX among themselves and with others, as part of a plan to change or influence control of CSX by acquiring a large stake in CSX while evading the reporting requirements of the securities laws.
 
-2-
 
4.           Defendants acquired more than 5 percent of CSX common stock, in excess of the statutory threshold, without making the disclosures required by the securities laws.  In February 2007 defendant Snehal Amin told CSX that TCI owned 14 percent of CSX.  Defendants repeated this assertion to CSX and to CSXs advisors on several occasions.  Yet, defendants did not make any disclosure required by Section 13(d) until they filed their Schedule 13D on December 19, 2007, 10 months after defendant Amin stated that TCI owned 14 percent of CSX.
5.           The December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D is materially false and misleading. Defendants failed to disclose, among other things, the extent of defendants interest in CSX, the extent of defendants coordinated efforts and their contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships relating to shares of CSX, and defendants plans to change or influence control of CSX.
6.           Defendants have continued to violate the securities laws with a proxy solicitation seeking to elect a slate of nominees to CSXs board of directors at the 2008 annual meeting of CSX shareholders as part of a plan to change or influence control of CSX.
7.           Defendants preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2008, is materially false and misleading. Defendants failed to disclose, among other things, the extent of defendants interest in CSX and the extent of defendants coordinated efforts and their contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships relating to shares of CSX.

8.           The declaratory and injunctive relief sought herein is necessary, among other reasons, to prevent defendants from benefitting from their wrongdoing, and to provide CSX shareholders with all information to which they are entitled and that they need in order to vote at the June 25, 2008 annual meeting.  Proper disclosure will allow CSX shareholders to evaluate fairly their investment in CSX and any actions relating to CSX, including the election of directors.  Without truthful information about defendants holdings in CSX securities, defendants motives for acquiring those securities, defendants plans for CSX and the extent of their relationships with other parties regarding their interest in CSX, shareholders will be irreparably harmed.
9.           Defendants should be required to divest themselves of all CSX shares that they acquired, and terminate all swaps referencing CSX shares that they entered into, renewed or extended from the time when defendants should have but failed to file a Schedule 13D disclosing their beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of CSX common stock and the other information required to be disclosed under the securities laws.  Alternatively, defendants should either be prohibited from voting such shares at the 2008 annual meeting or be required to vote such shares in proportion with the votes of the other CSX shareholders.
10.           This action arises under Sections 13(d), 14(a) and 20(a) of the 34 Act, 15 U.S.C.  78m(d), 78n(a), 78t(a) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC.
11.           Jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action is based upon 28 U.S.C.  1331, 1332, 1367 and Section 27 of the 34 Act, 15 U.S.C.  78aa.

12.           Venue in this district is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the 34 Act, 15 U.S.C.  78aa, and 28 U.S.C.  1391(d).
13.           Declaratory relief is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2201 because an actual controversy exists regarding defendants compliance with Sections 13(d) and 14(a) of the 34 Act and with CSXs Amended and Restated Bylaws.
14.           Plaintiff CSX is a publicly traded transportation company incorporated under the laws of Virginia and headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida.  Through its wholly owned subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc., a Class I rail carrier incorporated under the laws of Virginia, it operates one of the largest rail systems in the United States and the largest rail system in the eastern half of the country.

15.           Defendant The Childrens Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP (TCIF UK) is a United Kingdom limited liability partnership.
16.           Defendant The Childrens Investment Fund Management (Cayman) Ltd. (TCIF Cayman) is a Cayman Islands company affiliated with TCIF UK.
17.           Defendant The Childrens Investment Master Fund (TCI Fund) is a Cayman Islands company managed by both TCIF UK and TCIF Cayman.
18.           Defendant Snehal Amin is a citizen of the United States and a founding partner and a controlling person of TCIF UK.

20.           Defendant 3G Fund L.P. (3G Fund) is a Cayman Islands limited partnership.
21.           Defendant 3G Capital Partners L.P. (3G L.P.) is a Cayman Islands limited partnership and the general partner of 3G Fund.

24.           In connection with their investment in shares of CSX common stock, TCI formulated a plan to make began a series of calls and requests for meetings with CSX management, resulting in a meeting with CSXs financial advisors from Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York in January 2007.

25.           TCI presented various proposals to CSX management and their advisors, including a proposal that CSX management pursue a leveraged buyout (LBO) transaction and a proposal that CSX pursue an extraordinary recapitalization involving taking on substantially more debt and repurchasing a significant portion of its outstanding shares.  The recapitalization would have required CSX to increase its leverage to the point where its credit ratings would fall significantly below investment grade.
26.           TCI represented that it owned a significant stake in CSX,  between 10 and 14 percent of CSX,  and that a large portion of that interest was held through derivative swap arrangements. TCI stated that it had all the economic interests of ownership through swaps that it could convert at any time to physical ownership of CSX shares.
 
-6-
 
27.           On February 15, 2007, during a BB&T Capital Markets Transportation Conference, defendant Amin told CSXs Chief Financial Officer that we own 14 percent of your company.
28.           On March 2, 2007, TCI made a filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR) to cross the $500 million acquisition threshold with respect to shares of CSX common stock.  That filing would not have been required if TCI had only a passive investment purpose for acquiring those shares.
29.           On March 29, 2007, during a meeting with CSX in New York, defendant Amin told CSX that TCIs swaps were equivalent to more than 10 percent of CSXs outstanding shares; that our swaps give us the economic equivalent of ownership; that TCI could become the direct owner of more than 10 percent of CSXs outstanding shares; and that TCI would be taking voting positions with respect to shares of CSX. TCI threatened that if CSX did not immediately announce a 20 percent stock repurchase in its April 2007 earnings release, there would be no limits to what TCI would do.
30.           On April 7, 2007, during a call with CSXs outside advisors from Evercore Partners (Evercore), defendant Hohn stated that TCI had plans to convert indirect holdings of CSX to direct holdings and were then doing so currently.
31.           On May 8, 2007, during a Bear Stearns conference in New York, defendant Amin made a presentation to investors in which he said that CSX could sell itself in an LBO, indicating that he had contacted private equity firms to line up bids and had, in hand, a 100-page indicative financing proposal from a bank that could underwrite the LBO debt.

32.           On June 14, 2007, after a presentation given by CSXs Chief Financial Officer at the Merrill Lynch Global Transportation Conference in New York, defendant Amin suggested that if CSXs board of directors was opposed to changes in CSXs capital structure to increase leverage, the board was inhibiting the creation of value.
33.           On June 20, 2007 TCI representatives met with CSXs advisors from Evercore in New York and indicated that TCI directly owned 4 percent of CSXs shares and held over 10 percent in swaps.  At that meeting, TCI told Evercore that they would go to war and seek to replace the entire CSX board of directors if CSX management did not yield to TCIs demands.
34.           On July 17, 2007, in a call with CSXs advisors from Evercore, defendant Hohn said that TCI would attempt to change the entire CSX board of directors.
35.           On October 16, 2007, TCI sent a letter to the board of directors of CSX, which it publicized, urging CSX to allow shareholders of 10 percent of CSXs shares to call special meetings for any purpose, including the election of directors.
36.           From May 9 through May 15, 2007, defendant Amin sent CSX a series of emails requesting information about the result of a shareholder vote that was announced at the 2007 annual meeting of CSX shareholders. The vote was on a non-binding proposal to give a minority of shareholders the ability to call special meetings.
37.           On May 9, 2007, CSX received a phone call from 3G inquiring about the result of that same shareholder vote.
38.           In the period from May 9 through May 17, 2007, CSX received phone calls from other hedge funds requesting information regarding the result of that shareholder vote.

39.           On June 13, 2007 CSX met with defendant Behring of 3G at 3Gs New York office.  At that meeting, 3G told CSX that 3G would be making an HSR filing.  CSX executives saw in 3Gs offices a copy of presentation materials prepared by TCI about TCIs proposals with respect to CSX.
40.           On June 14, 2007, CSX was formally notified of a 3G HSR filing indicating 3Gs intent to acquire shares of CSX common stock in excess of $597.9 million. TCI had made its HSR filing on March 2, 2007.  Those filings would not have been required if 3G and TCI had only passive investment purposes for acquiring those shares.
41.           On September 6, 2007, TCI and 3G together attended the CSX Analyst/Investor conference in New York. Afterwards, defendant Hohn along with representatives of 3G approached CSXs Chief Financial Officer.  Soon thereafter, defendant Hohn approached CSXs advisors from Evercore and Morgan Stanley & Co. to discuss CSXs board composition, CSXs share repurchase program, and the non-binding special meeting proposal that was approved at the 2007 annual meeting.
42.           One of the defendants nominees to CSXs board, Gilbert Lamphere, purchased CSX common stock on November 6, 2007 and November 13, 2007.  Lamphere purchased those shares in connection with his becoming a nominee to the CSX board, and he entered into a nominee agreement with 3G, obliging 3G to pay the costs of soliciting proxies and to indemnify Lamphere against certain losses.
43.           Another of the defendants nominees, Timothy OToole, purchased shares of CSX common stock on December 6, 2007.  OToole purchased those shares in connection with becoming a nominee to the CSX board and entered into a nominee agreement with TCI,  obliging TCI to pay the costs of soliciting proxies and to indemnify OToole against certain losses.

44.           In anticipation of a May 7, 2008 annual meeting date and a related record date of February 27, 2008, representatives of CSX began notifying brokers and the NYSE of the record and meeting dates beginning on January 30, 2008.  That information became generally available to bankers, brokers and other financial institutions.
45.           Financial institutions that hold shares of publicly traded companies for their own account or for the account of their customers frequently lend such shares to traders who engage in short-selling of such shares.  Under the terms of the lending arrangements, ownership of the shares is transferred to the short-seller, but the financial institution has the right to require the short-seller to return ownership of the shares to the financial institution at any time.
46.           Where a financial institution holds shares for its own account to hedge its commitments under a swap arrangement, the financial institution has no incentive to require that the short-sellers return shares ahead of a record date for a shareholder meeting unless there is a contractual requirement or some explicit or implicit understanding with the swap holder with respect to the voting of the shares.
47.           Between February 15, 2008 and February 27, 2008, the two-week period prior to original the record date, almost 37 million shares of CSX common stock were transferred to financial institutions that have been identified by defendants as counterparties to their swaps that reference shares of CSX common stock (net of any shares transferred from such institutions), establishing custody of those shares in such institutions as of the record date.

48.           The number of shares involved in those transfers substantially exceeds the number of shares transferred in connection with dividend and voting record dates in 2007, including those dates after which TCI and 3G acquired substantial positions in CSX stock.
49.           After the record date passed, between February 28, 2008 and March 10, 2008, over 20 million shares were transferred from the same financial institutions back to third parties.
50.           The volume of shares moving into the custody of swap counterparties in advance of the original February 27, 2008 record date indicates the existence of agreements or understandings that those counterparties would vote the shares in accordance with the wishes or expectations of TCI and 3G, or alternatively, that the swap counterparties are intending to vote the shares in accordance with the wishes or expectations of TCI and 3G because of their relationships with TCI and 3G.
51.           On March 17, 2008 CSX announced that the 2008 annual shareholder meeting would be held on June 25, 2008 and that the record date for purposes of the meeting would be April 21, 2008.
52.           On March 10, 2008, the defendants filed their preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A.
53.           Under Rule 14a-6, defendants may be able to file their definitive proxy statement as early as March 20, 2008.
54.           As soon as defendants file their definitive proxy statement, they may begin to solicit and receive proxies to vote at the annual shareholder meeting on June 25, 2008.

Schedule 14A is the official form for compliance with
 
the number of shares of the issuer which are beneficially owned and information as to any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with any person with respect to that interest.

59.           In their Schedule 13D and preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, defendants state that they are the beneficial owners of 35,054,952 (approximately 8.7 percent) of outstanding ordinary shares of CSX.  Defendants disclaim beneficial ownership of the approximately 12.3 percent of CSXs shares referenced in the defendants swap arrangements. Those statements are false because the securities laws confer beneficial ownership of that 12.3 percent of shares referenced in the swaps on the defendants.
60.           Defendants are now and have been for at least 10 months before they made their December 19, 2007 disclosure, the beneficial owners of the shares referenced in the swaps.

Defendants beneficially own the shares of CSX referenced in their swaps because they were
part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of the
s

aws. Throughout 2007,
TCI
and 3G each independently maintained direct ownership of over 4 percent of the outstanding shares of
CSX
common stock--just below the 5 percent reporting threshold.  
TCI
and 3G did not disclose that they were coordinating their efforts.  At all relevant times,
TCI
intended to change or influence control of
CSX
.  At all relevant times,
TCI
could convert the shares referenced in the swaps at any time.  
TCI
and 3G each entered into swap arrangements with the purpose or effect of divesting [them] of beneficial ownership . . . or preventing the vesting of such beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements.
 
-15-
 
64.           Defendants beneficially own the shares of CSX referenced in their swaps because of the arrangements or understandings they have with swap counterparties, or because of the nature of the relationships between defendants and the counterparties.  Based on those understandings or relationships, the counterparties will vote the shares in accordance with defendants wishes, or they will deliver physical shares of CSX stock to defendants upon settlement of the swaps.  Such understandings or relationships give defendants beneficial ownership of the shares by way of indirect voting or investment power.
65.           TCI could convert its swaps into direct ownership of CSX shares at any time because of an understanding between TCI and the counterparties to the swaps that they will sell or otherwise deliver the physical the shares of CSX stock referenced in the swaps to TCI upon settlement or because of the relationship between TCI and the counterparties.
 
66.           Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act states that when two or more persons act as a ..  .  .  group for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of securities of an issuer, such ..  .  .  group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection.
67.           Independent of the shares referenced in defendants swap arrangements, TCI and 3G formed a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) which beneficially owned more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of CSX common stock, yet defendants failed to timely make disclosures pursuant to Section 13(d).
 
-16-
 
68.           Defendants, in their Schedule 13D and preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, misrepresent the facts concerning the formation of the defendants group.  The defendants represent that TCI and 3G agreed to coordinate their efforts with respect to their interests in CSX on December 12, 2007.  That representation is false because TCI and 3G formed a group no later than November 6, 2007.
69.           According to Appendix A of the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D filing, defendants nominee to CSXs board, Gilbert H. Lamphere, purchased shares of CSX stock on November 6 and November 13, 2007.  Item 4 of that same disclosure states that Mr. Lamphere made those purchases in connection with becoming [a] nominee[] to the board of directors of [CSX].
70.           Even though a nominee purchased stock as early as November 2007, the defendants failed to disclose themselves as a group whose beneficial ownership exceeded the 5 percent threshold until December 19, 2007.
71.           The formation of the defendants group occurred even earlier than November 6, 2007.  TCI and 3G coordinated their efforts with respect to their interests in CSX:

In the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, defendants falsely state that TCI beneficially owned an aggregate of 17,796,998 Shares, constituting approximately 4.2 % of the Shares outstanding. (, Item 5). Defendants also falsely disclaim any beneficial ownership of the approximately 11 percent of CSX shares referenced by TCIs swap arrangements. (, Item 6).  Those statements are false because TCI beneficially owned the approximately 11 percent of shares associated with the swaps, giving it beneficial ownership of more than 15 percent of CSXs outstanding shares.

(, Item 5). Defendants also falsely disclaim any beneficial ownership of the approximately 0.8 percent of CSX shares referenced in 3Gs swap arrangement. (, Item 6).  Those statements are false because 3G beneficially owned the approximately 0.8 percent of shares associated with the swaps, giving it beneficial ownership of approximately 4.9 percent of CSXs outstanding shares.

76.           In the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, defendants falsely state that, as of December 12, 2007, TCI and 3G entered into an agreement to coordinate certain of their efforts and that TCI and 3G may be deemed to have formed a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) [of the 34 Act]. (, Item 5). That statement is false because the defendants formed a group prior to December 12, 2007.

77.           In the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, defendants falsely state that TCI expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by [3G] and the Additional Nominees while 3G expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by [TCI] and the Additional Nominees. (, Item 5). That statement is false because once the group was formed, each defendant beneficially owned all shares of CSX common stock that were beneficially owned by all members of the group by operation of law.  Rule 13d-5(b)(1) states that when two or more persons agree to act together for the purposes of acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of equity securities of an issuer, the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, for purposes of [section 13(d) of the 34 Act], as of the date of such agreement, of all equity securitiesof that issuer beneficially owned by any such persons.

In the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, defendants falsely state that they acquired Shares for investment in the ordinary course of business, and failed to disclose that their purpose in acquiring shares of CSX common stock is to change or influence control of CSX. (, Item 4).  Defendants have been planning to change or influence control of CSX since no later than June 2007, when TCI told CSXs advisors that TCI would go to war and seek to replace the entire board.  Defendants failed to disclose their plans and proposals to make major changes in CSXs business and corporate structure.

79.           In the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, defendants falsely state that they have no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) . .. . with respect to any securities of CSX, except as described elsewhere in the Schedule 13D. (, Item 6).  That statement is false because defendants have acted with respect to CSX securities pursuant to contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with other persons that have not been disclosed.
Id.
80.           In violation of Item 3 of Schedule 13D, the defendants misrepresented the source of funds used to acquire their interest in CSX as solely the general working capital of TCI and 3G.  Defendants falsely state that the source of funds used to acquire the [TCI or 3G] Shares reported herein was the general working capital of [the TCI Fund or the 3G Fund.] (Item 3). TCI and 3G have used borrowed funds to acquire their interest in CSX.

85.           On March 10, 2008, defendants filed their preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A.  That Schedule 14A is materially false and misleading because, among other reasons, it repeats material misstatements contained in the December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D, does not adequately disclose and it falsely states defendants purposes in seeking to elect its nominees as directors.

Defendant TCI also falsely disclaims any beneficial ownership in securities that may be referenced in [swap arrangements] or that may be held from time to time by any counterparties to the contracts with regard to the approximately 11.5 percent of CSX shares referenced by TCIs swap arrangements.

Those statements are false because TCI beneficially owns the approximately 11.5 percent of shares associated with the swaps, giving it beneficial ownership of approximately 15.9 percent of CSXs outstanding shares.

In the March 10, 2008 Schedule 14A, defendants falsely state that TCI expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by [3G] and the Nominees (as applicable) while 3G expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Shares beneficially owned by [TCI] and the Nominees (as applicable).

On January 8, 2008 defendants submitted a Stockholder Notice of Intent to Nominate Persons for Election as Directors to CSX Corporation (January 8 Notice) in which they claimed group beneficial ownership of 8.3% of the outstanding shares of CSX common stock.

97.           In the January 21, 2008 and January 25, 2008 Notices, defendants incorporated the information provided in the January 8 Notice concerning their beneficial ownership.
98.           Defendants Notices fail to comply with Article I, Section 11(a)(ii) of CSXs Bylaws because, in order for shareholders to nominate persons for election to the CSX board of directors or to propose other business to be considered at an annual meeting of shareholders, they are required to disclose the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially.

125.           Defendants Behring, Hohn and Amin are controlling persons of TCI, 3G and the defendant group within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the 34 Act and liable for the violations of Sections 13(d) and 14(a) of the 34 Act as set forth above.
 
126.           CSX repeats the allegations of preceding paragraphs 1-125 as if fully set forth herein.
127.           Section 13.1-624 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act provides that a corporations bylaws may contain any provision for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the corporation that is not inconsistent with the law or the articles of incorporation.
128.           Defendants are bound by the terms of the Bylaws with respect to the matters contemplated thereby, including Article I, Section 11(a)(ii)s provisions governing the way in which a shareholder may properly bring a nomination or other business before an annual meeting.

129.           Article I, Section 11(c)(i) of CSXs Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that [o]nly such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11 shall be eligible at an annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Section 11.
130.           On January 8, 21 and 25, 2008, defendants supplied to CSX purported Notices of their intent to nominate five persons for election to the CSX board of directors at the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders and to propose amendments of the CSX Amended and Restated Bylaws, in compliance with Article I, Section 11 of CSXs Amended and Restated Bylaws.
131.           Defendants Notices fail to comply with Article I, Section 11(a)(ii) of CSXs Bylaws because they failed to accurately report the number of shares of capital stock of CSX that defendants owned beneficially. As in their December 19, 2007 Schedule 13D and March 10, 2008 preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, defendants falsely state their beneficial ownership in the Notices.
132.           By reason of the foregoing, defendants Notices are invalid as noncompliant with CSXs Bylaws, and CSX is entitled to a declaration to that effect.
 
WHEREFORE, CSX prays for relief in the form of an Order:
(a)           Declaring that defendants failed to file timely, complete and accurate disclosures in violation of Sections 13(d) and 14(a) of the 34 Act;
(b)           Directing that defendants file truthful and accurate Schedule 13D and Schedule 14A disclosures, in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations, forthwith;
 
-29-
 
(c)           Enjoining defendants from acquiring additional shares of CSX until accurate and compliant Schedule 13D and Schedule 14A disclosures have been filed;
(d)           Enjoining defendants from acquiring any CSX shares referenced in swap arrangements to which they are party;
(e)           Directing that defendants sell, in an orderly manner pursuant to a plan ordered by the Court, all shares acquired, and terminate all swaps referencing CSX shares that they entered into, renewed or extended, after the date by which they should have filed a Schedule 13D and enjoining defendants from voting such shares at the 2008 annual meeting of CSX shareholders or, alternatively, directing that defendants vote such shares in proportion with the votes of the other CSX shareholders;
(f)           Enjoining defendants from voting any proxies received prior to such time as the Court ascertains that defendants have filed accurate and compliant Schedule 13D and Schedule 14A disclosures;
(g)           Declaring defendants Notices invalid as noncompliant with CSXs Bylaws;
(h)           Granting leave to CSX to conduct expedited discovery with respect to the claims alleged herein; and
 
-30-
 
(i)           Granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
