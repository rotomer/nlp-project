First Quarter Highlights:
 CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today reported first quarter earnings of $351 million, or 85 cents per share, versus $240 million, or 52 cents per share, last year. This represents a 63 percent improvement in earnings per share over last year.
Jacksonville, Florida (Apr. 15, 2008)
First quarter results included 5 cents per share from a non-cash equity earnings adjustment this year and 2 cents per share from insurance recoveries last year.  On a comparable basis, excluding these items, first quarter EPS was up 60 percent from a year ago. (See table below for reconciliation of quarter items to reported numbers.)
Our highly focused workforce continued to drive shareholder value at a record setting pace in the first quarter by delivering outstanding safety, customer service and financial results, said Michael Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  In addition, the diverse business portfolio we have created is allowing the company to grow though the current economic cycle.
CSX generated significant revenue growth in six of its ten markets, resulting in record first quarter revenues of $2.7 billion, a 12 percent increase over the first quarter of 2007. The company overcame softness in the housing and automotive sectors through yield management, fuel recovery and market drivers including growth in ethanol and grain shipments, increased demand for export coal, and a stable industrial economy.
The company achieved these revenue gains while holding non-fuel expenses flat, which drove record first quarter operating income of $626 million, up from $485 million last year. The respective quarters included insurance gains of $2 million and $18 million. On a comparable basis, excluding these gains, operating income was up 34 percent.  At the core of this improvement were stronger safety and service levels, greater labor productivity and increased fuel efficiency, resulting in a 370 basis point improvement in the operating ratio to 77 percent on a comparable basis.
Reflecting the companys strong first quarter performance and the underlying strength of its business, CSX is now targeting the upper end of its previously announced 2008 EPS guidance of $3.40 - $3.60 on a comparable basis.
CSX also reaffirmed its long-term financial targets announced on March 17, 2008. With 2007 as the baseline, the company is confident that it can achieve compound annual growth in operating income of 13 to 15 percent, as well as 18 to 21 percent compound annual growth in EPS before the impact of share repurchases through 2010.  Additionally, CSX is targeting an operating ratio in the low-70s and free cash flow before dividends exceeding $1 billion in 2010.
The company repurchased $300 million of its outstanding common stock in the first quarter and remains committed to repurchasing an additional $3 billion in common stock by the end of 2009.  As previously stated, the company is also investing $5 billion in its transportation network between 2008 and 2010 to meet the nations burgeoning demand for freight rail service.
Our guidance and actions to enhance shareholder value are indicative of our momentum and confidence in the future of the company, said Ward. CSX is poised and motivated to deliver substantial value in the short term while enhancing its network and service to create value for many years to come.
CSX Corporation, based in Jacksonville, Fla., is a leading transportation company providing rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services. The companys transportation network spans approximately 21,000 miles with service to 23 eastern states and the District of Columbia, and connects to more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Quarterly Financial Report available on the company's web site at http://investors.csx.com in the Investors section and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
CSX executives will conduct a quarterly earnings conference call with the investment community on April 16, 2008 at 8:30 a.m. ET. Investors, media and the public may listen to the conference call by dialing 888-327-6279 (888-EARN-CSX) and asking for the CSX earnings call. (Callers outside the U.S., dial 773-756-0199). Participants should dial in 10 minutes prior to the call.
In conjunction with the call, a live webcast will be accessible and presentation materials will be posted on the companys web site at http://investors.csx.com.
Following the earnings call, an internet replay of the presentation will be archived on the company web site.
 
GAAP Reconciliation
1
 
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the SEC may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided operating income and earnings per share adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided above. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.
Forward-Looking Disclosure
 
This information and other statements by the company contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act with respect to, among other items: projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, cost-savings, expenses, or other financial items; statements of managements plans, strategies and objectives for future operation, and managements expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved; statements concerning proposed new products and services; and statements regarding future economic, industry or market conditions or performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as believe, expect, anticipate, project, estimate and similar expressions.
 
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the company does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.
 
Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual performance or results could differ materially from that anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements include, among others: (i) the companys success in implementing its financial and operational initiatives, (ii) changes in domestic or international economic or business conditions, including those affecting the rail industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation); (iii) legislative or regulatory changes; (iv) the inherent business risks associated with safety and security; and (v) the outcome of claims and litigation involving or affecting the company.
 
Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified in the companys SEC reports, accessible on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and the companys website at http://investors.csx.com.

The Company was able to achieve continued pricing gains during first quarter 2008 predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that rail-based solutions provide versus other modes of transportation. These pricing gains, and higher fuel recovery due to higher fuel prices, more than offset volume weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets.
Merchandise
 Revenue and revenue-per-unit increases were driven primarily by improved pricing and increased fuel recovery.  Volume was down due to weakness in plastic shipments and chemicals used in construction.
Chemicals
 Volume declines in building products, appliances and aggregates, which include crushed stone, sand and gravel, were due to continued softness in residential construction and related markets.  Revenue-per-unit increases were driven by yield management initiatives and favorable fuel recoveries.
Emerging Markets, Forest Products, and Food and Consumer
 Gains in price and fuel  surcharge coverage led to increases in revenue and revenue per unit.  Volume growth was due to strong demand for many of the commodities in this segment including feed ingredients, export grain, wheat, soybeans and vegetable oil.  Additionally, ethanol volumes rose substantially as a result of expanded use of ethanol in the northeastern United States.
Agricultural Products
 Improved pricing and increased fuel recovery continue to drive revenue and revenue-per-unit gains.  Volumes were down slightly as weakness in sheet steel used for automobile production more than offset increases in scrap metal, semi-finished steel and pipe shipments.
Metals
 Revenue and revenue-per-unit increased due to favorable pricing actions and a rise in long-haul, high revenue per unit shipments.  Volume declines in short-haul phosphate shipments in Florida more than offset a trend of stronger fertilizer volumes due to increased crop plantings.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
Coal
Sustained growth in yield, longer length of haul and improved fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenue-per-unit. Volumes increased in the export market due to strong overseas demand.  These gains were offset by weakness in utility shipments.
Automotive
Volume was down due to declines in vehicle production and vehicle sales, and a strike at a supplier to the automotive industry. Revenue-per-unit improved due to price increases and higher fuel recoveries.
Intermodal Operating Revenue
International Revenue-per-unit increases were primarily driven by increased fuel recovery and yield management.  Volumes declined due to slowing imports and customer losses in 2007.
-
DomesticGrowth in transcontinental (coast-to-coast) shipments resulted in revenue and volume gains. Revenue-per-unit increases were primarily driven by increased fuel recovery as the favorable mix change from increased transcontinental business was largely offset by the growth in lower revenue-per-unit short-haul train services introduced in 2007.

Expenses increased $150 million from last years first quarter.  Significant variances are described below.
Labor and Fringe expense increased $11 million. This increase was primarily driven by wage and benefit inflation and higher incentive compensation. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity gains from improved operations and lower volume, which resulted in a reduction of train crew headcount.  
Labor and Fringe
 
expenses decreased $32 million. The primary driver was a decrease in train accident-related expenses from the prior year and a current year decrease in the cost associated with personal injuries.  These decreases were partially offset by inflation.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expenseincreased $157 million due to higher fuel prices which more than offset increased fuel efficiency.
Fuel
 
expense increased $1 million. A larger asset base related to higher capital spending was largely offset by lower depreciation rates, at rail and intermodal, resulting from the periodic review of asset useful lives.   
Depreciation
expense decreased $9 million primarily due to lower volumes which more than offset the impacts of inflation and asset utilization.
Equipment and Other Rents
of $2 millionrepresents insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina property damage and lost profits.  The decrease from last years quarter is due to timing of cash receipts.
