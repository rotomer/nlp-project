GAAP Reconciliation
1
CSX reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to manage the companys business that fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures) by the SEC may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparisons to prior reported results.
In press releases and presentation slides for stock analysts, CSX has provided financial information adjusted for certain items, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The companys management evaluates its business and makes certain operating decisions (e.g., budgeting, forecasting, employee compensation, asset management and resource allocation) using these adjusted numbers.
Likewise, this information facilitates comparisons to financial results that are directly associated with ongoing business operations as well as provides comparable historical information. Lastly, earnings forecasts prepared by stock analysts and other third parties generally exclude the effects of items that are difficult to predict or measure in advance and are not directly related to CSXs ongoing operations. A reconciliation between GAAP and the non-GAAP measure is provided above. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures.

Expenses increased $272 million from last years quarter.  Significant variances are described below.
expense decreased $10 million. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction of train crew headcount due to lower volumes and improved productivity. Largely offsetting this decrease was wage and benefit inflation.
Labor and Fringe
expenses increased $43 million. The primary drivers were year-over-year casualty reserve changes, proxy and related litigation costs and inflation.
Materials, Supplies and Other
expenseincreased $221 million due to higher fuel prices which more than offset increased fuel efficiency and lower volume.
Fuel
 
expense increased $5 million. A larger asset base related to higher capital spending was partially offset by lower depreciation rates at rail and intermodal, resulting from the periodic review of asset useful lives.   
Depreciation
expense increased $5 million as lower volumes were more than offset by equipment utilization due to a significant decline in the automotive business and inflation.
Equipment and Other Rents
increased $8 million driven by Intermodals increased transcontinental business and inflation.
