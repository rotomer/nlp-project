relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand, and of the Underwriters on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company and the Guarantor in connection with the purchase of the Securities hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company and the Guarantor or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.  For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company and the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.
 
8.            .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that if the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities within 36 hours of such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except as otherwise provided in Section 10.  In the event of a default by any
Default by an Underwriter
provided

Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or to any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.

This security (the Security) is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the Securities) of CSX Transportation, Inc., a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the Company, which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, unlimited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of December 13, 2007 (the Base Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 24, 2008, among the Company, CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the Guarantor) and the Trustee (the Second Supplemental Indenture) (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture being herein called the Indenture) to which indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an aggregate principal amount of $350,538,000 (THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS) (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Schedule A hereto, the Principal Amount) of the Securities of such series, with the dates for the payment of principal and interest (each such date, a Payment Date), date of original issuance, and Maturity Date specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.

The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of $350,538,000 (THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS), payable in installments of principal commencing on April 15, 2009, and ending on October 15, 2014, as set forth for each date in Schedule A hereto (as such Schedule A may be replaced from time to time pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Second Supplemental Indenture), and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from October 24, 2008 or from the most recent Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is a Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2009, and at the date of final Maturity at the rate of 8.375% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.  The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in full payment of this Note, and any premium, on any Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Payment Date.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at the date of final Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
The Indenture Estate is held by the Trustee as security for the Securities of this series.  Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the rights of the Holder of, and the nature and extent of the security for, this Security, as well as for a statement of the terms and conditions of the trusts created by the Indenture, to all of which terms and conditions in the Indenture each Holder hereof agrees by its acceptance of this Security.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph.  If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the Depository) notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable with the registration information necessary to prepare such definitive Registered Securities or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above,
definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof.  Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar.  Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.

Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by the Company for that purpose.  Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted.  Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of a Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity.  If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.
 
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the offices of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) as Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts by check mailed to the registered Holders thereof; , , that at the option of the Holder, payment of interest may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Person entitled hereto as such account shall be provided to the Security Registrar and shall appear in the Security Register.

(b) 
   
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and the Equipment Notes shall have been accelerated (and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded) pursuant to Section 502 of the Base Indenture or Section 6.3(a) hereof, then and in every such case the Trustee shall be entitled to exercise any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any and all of the remedies pursuant to Article Five of the Base Indenture and Article Six hereof and may recover judgment in its own name as Trustee against the Company and Indenture Estate and may take possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate, and may exclude the Company and all persons claiming under the Company wholly or partly therefrom.
 
(c) 
   
The Trustee may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, and either before or after taking possession, and without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first given written notice of such sale to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of such sale or the date on which the Trustee enters into a binding contract for a private sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein, at public auction to the highest bidder or at private sale in one lot as an entirety or in separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the Trustee may determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred to.  Any such public sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale or sales, without further notice, and the Trustee or the Holder or Holders of any Equipment Notes, or any interest therein, may bid and become the purchaser at any such public sale.  The Trustee may exercise such right without possession or production of the Equipment Notes or proof of ownership thereof, and as representative of the Holders may exercise such right without including the Holders as parties to any suit or proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the Indenture Estate.

Any action by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.3(d) will in all respects be subject to compliance with any mandatory legal requirements applicable to any such action.

The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, together with the installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in full payment of this Note, and any premium, on any Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Payment Date.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at the date of final Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
 
The Indenture Estate is held by the Trustee as security for the Securities of this series.  Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the rights of the Holder of, and the nature and extent of the security for, this Security, as well as for a statement of the terms and conditions of the trusts created by the Indenture, to all of which terms and conditions in the Indenture each Holder hereof agrees by its acceptance of this Security.
 
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph.  If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the Depository) notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable with the registration information necessary to prepare such definitive Registered Securities or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof.  Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar.  Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.

Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
 
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of a Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity.  If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.
 
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the offices of The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) as Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts by check mailed to the registered Holders thereof; , , that at the option of the Holder, payment of interest may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Person entitled hereto as such account shall be provided to the Security Registrar and shall appear in the Security Register.
