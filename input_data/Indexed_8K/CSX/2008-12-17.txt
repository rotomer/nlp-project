Exhibit 10.1
 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
WHEREAS, plaintiff, Deborah Donoghue (Plaintiff), a shareholder of CSX Corporation (CSX), brought this action (the Action) pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), to recover so-called short-swing profits alleged to have been realized by defendants The Childrens Investment Master Fund (TCI), The Childrens Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP, The Childrens Investment Fund Management (Cayman) Ltd., Christopher Hohn, Timothy OToole, 3G Fund LP (3G), 3G Capital Partners Ltd., 3G Capital Partners LP, Alexandre Behring and Gilbert H. Lamphere or some of them (collectively, the Settling Defendants) in connection with their putative purchases and sales of CSX securities;
WHEREAS, the Settling Defendants deny any wrongdoing whatsoever and this Stipulation of Settlement (Stipulation) shall in no event be construed or deemed to be evidence of or an admission or concession on the part of the Settling Defendants with respect to any claim, or any fault or liability or wrongdoing or damages whatsoever, or any deficiency in the defenses that the Settling Defendants have or may assert.  The Plaintiff, CSX and the Settling Defendants (collectively, the Parties) recognize, however, that the Action has been filed by Plaintiff and defended by the Settling Defendants in good faith and with adequate basis in fact under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that the Action is being voluntarily settled after advice of counsel and negotiation between counsel for the Parties;
 
 
WHEREAS, CSX and the Settling Defendants are parties to an action entitled v. , 08 Civil 2764 (LAK) (the 13D Action) in which the court issued a 115-page Opinion and Final Judgment (the Opinion) after trial; the Opinion is currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit;
CSX Corporation
The Childrens Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP
WHEREAS, Plaintiffs theory of liability in this Action is based on the June 11, 2008 Opinion in the 13D Action, wherein the court found that:  (i) TCIs transactions in total return cash-settled equity swaps (the equity swaps) resulted in it being deemed to be the beneficial owner, within the meaning of Rule 13d-3(b) of the Exchange Act, of CSX common stock held by its swap counterparties as hedges to the swaps; and (ii) TCI and 3G purchased and sold CSX common stock and/or equity swaps and were members of a group under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act along with other Settling Defendants;
WHEREAS, Plaintiff asserts that by reason of such beneficial ownership TCI may be deemed to beneficially own over 10 percent of CSXs common stock;
WHEREAS, Plaintiff asserts that 3G, by virtue of its membership in a group, may be deemed to beneficially own over 10 percent of CSXs common stock;
 
 
WHEREAS, the Settling Defendants vigorously contest the findings in the 13D Action and have appealed the Opinion;
WHEREAS, Timothy OToole and Gilbert Lamphere had no involvement in any of the trading activity alleged to give rise to Section 16(b) liability and were incorrectly named as defendants in this Action;
WHEREAS, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard argument in the 13D Action on August 25, 2008; the Parties recognize that, if the Second Circuit reverses the findings in the 13D Action that the Settling Defendants beneficially owned CSXs common stock through their transactions in equity swaps, there will be no basis for liability in this Action.  The Parties further recognize that CSXs theory of beneficial ownership in the 13D Action is novel, that a number of have submitted briefs in support and opposition to CSXs position, and that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), Division of Corporation Finance (the Division), sent a letter to the trial court stating that [t]he Division believes that interpreting an investors beneficial ownership under Rule 13d-3 to include shares used in a counter-partys hedge, absent unusual circumstances, would be novel and would create significant uncertainties for investors who have used equity swaps in accordance with accepted market practices understood to be based on reasonably well-settled law;
amici
WHEREAS, given the risks and uncertainties of the outcome of the appeal in the 13D Action, CSX and Plaintiff have concluded that it is in the interest of CSX to settle this Action on the terms set forth herein (the Settlement);
 
 
WHEREAS, CSX obtained significant discovery from the defendants in the 13D Action, including records reflecting all of the Settling Defendants transactions in CSX equity securities and equity swaps related to CSX stock; thereafter, CSX engaged an expert consultant to prepare an analysis of potential damages under Section 16(b) arising from the Settling Defendants transactions in equity swaps and common stock, which reflects that the maximum recoverable damages under the Rules which govern the calculation of recoverable profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, may be as much as $128,000,000 for TCI and $9.6 million for 3G; and in connection with the Parties settlement negotiations, CSX has shared its discovery and analysis with Plaintiffs counsel in this Action;
WHEREAS, the Settling Defendants believe that, even if the Second Circuit affirms the Opinion, they have several meritorious defenses to Plaintiffs Section 16(b) claims and that the potential liability for the Section 16(b) claims is substantially lower than the $137.6 million calculated by Plaintiff and CSX;
WHEREAS, the Parties engaged in settlement negotiations among themselves which culminated in an agreement whereby TCI will pay CSX the sum of $10,000,000 and 3G will pay CSX the sum of $1,000,000;
WHEREAS, CSX and its disinterested directors (i.e., directors who have no financial interest in this litigation and are not affiliated with or nominated by the Settling Defendants), who are represented by their own independent counsel, realize that a settlement of this litigation on the terms described herein is in the best interests of CSX and its shareholders; and
 
 
WHEREAS, in evaluating the proposed settlement provided for herein, Plaintiff and her counsel have considered:  the substantial benefit being provided by the proposed Settlement; the uncertainties of the outcome of this Action, which Plaintiff recognizes turns on the outcome of the appeal in the 13D Action and TCIs separate defenses to Section 16(b) liability in this Action; CSXs theory of liability in the 13D Action is hotly contested and there is no precedent directly on point; and that resolution of the claims in this Action, wherever and however determined, likely would be submitted for appellate review, there would be yet additional time until there would be a final adjudication of the claims and defenses asserted, and additional legal fees, which could reduce the amount of any ultimate recovery (whether on a litigated judgment, if Plaintiff were to prevail, or by settlement).
IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, as follows:
1.           As soon as practicable after this Stipulation has been executed, the Parties jointly shall move the Court for preliminary approval of this Settlement and the form of notice to shareholders, and for entry of a Preliminary Order, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
2.           Following entry of the Preliminary Order, (a) CSX shall file a Form 8-K with the SEC, issue a press release, place a notice of settlement on its website, and send notice of the proposed Stipulation substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Notice) by U.S. First Class Mail, to its shareholders who filed current Schedules 13D or 13G, or Form 13F, with the SEC, and (b) CSX and the Settling Defendants (other than Timothy OToole and Gilbert Lamphere) shall send a joint request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals advising it of the settlement of this Action and requesting that it defer further ruling on the appeal of the 13D Action until the Settling Defendants have sent notice that this Action has become Final or, in the event that it does not become Final, that litigation of this Action has resumed.
 
 
3.           If the Settlement contemplated by this Stipulation is approved by the Court after Notice and a hearing on the fairness of the Settlement, counsel for the Parties shall request that the Court enter an Order and Final Judgment (the Order and Final Judgment) substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit C.  The Order and Final Judgment shall become final (Final) following entry, either by expiration of the time for appeal or review of such Order or, if any appeal is filed and not dismissed, after the Order is affirmed on appeal and is no longer subject to review upon appeal or by writ of certiorari or motion for reconsideration.
4.           (a)           On or before the tenth business day after the Order approving the Settlement becomes Final (i) TCI shall wire transfer to CSX the amount of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) less the amount of attorneys fees and reimbursement of expenses, if any, awarded by the Court to Plaintiffs counsel, which amount shall be paid directly to Plaintiffs counsel and (ii) 3G shall wire transfer to CSX the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the Settlement Payments).  The total Settlement Payments, including any award of attorneys fee and reimbursement of expenses, shall not exceed $11,000,000.
(b)           Entry and Finality of the Order and Final Judgment is a condition precedent to TCIs and 3Gs obligation to make the Settlement Payment.
(c)           In the event the Court does not enter the Order approving the Settlement, or such Order does not become Final, this Stipulation shall be null and void except as to paragraphs 4(c), 6 and 13(a), and the Parties shall be returned to their positions as they existed on the date before the Settlement and without prejudice in any way.
nunc pro tunc
 
 
5.           In consideration of the Settlement Payment, CSX and Plaintiff on behalf of herself and any and all owners of any security (as defined in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act) of CSX or any other security or instrument, the value of which is derived from the value of any CSX equity security, each release and discharge the Settling Defendants, their present, future or former officers, directors, members, employees, agents, attorneys, representatives, advisors and affiliates or associates (as the latter two terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), trustees, parents, principals, subsidiaries, general or limited partners or partnerships, investment advisory clients and brokers, and each of their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns (the Related Parties) from any and all liability and damages under or based upon any and all claims, rights, causes of action, suits, matters, demands, transactions and issues, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to the assertions contained in the Amended Complaint in this Action or that could have been asserted in this Action (i) by Plaintiff on behalf of herself or any other person or entity, (ii) by CSX and/or (iii) by any and all owners of any security (as defined in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act) of CSX or any other security or instrument the value of which is derived from the value of any CSX equity security, or any of them, whether individually, directly, representatively, derivatively or in any other capacity for all claims arising out of or relating to any violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under Section 16 relating to trading in CSX securities, equity swaps and/or other securities or instruments the value of which is derived from the value of any CSX equity security, from the beginning of time up through the date that this Settlement becomes Final under paragraph 3.  This release does not extend to CSXs claims and the defendants defenses in the 13D Action.  Plaintiffs counsel, David Lopez, covenants not to bring any additional claims against the Settling Defendants and their Related Parties for trading in CSX securities, including, without limitation equity swaps or any other derivative security or instrument tied to the value of any CSX equity security arising from or relating to transactions in such securities or instruments up through the date that this Settlement becomes Final under paragraph 3, regardless of the theory of liability.
 
 
6.           This Stipulation and all negotiations and papers related to it, and any proceedings in connection with the Settlement, whether or not the Settlement becomes Final or is consummated, are not and shall not be construed to be evidence of, or an admission by, any of the Parties respecting the validity or invalidity of any of the claims or defenses asserted by the Parties or of the Settling Defendants liability or lack thereof with respect to any such claim or defense or for any damages sought in the Action, or of any wrongdoing or lack of wrongdoing by any or all of them whatsoever, and shall not be offered for admission or received as evidence of any such liability or wrongdoing or damages, or lack thereof.  This covenant expressly applies to but is not limited to the 13D Action: CSX and the Settling Defendants agree that neither this Stipulation, nor the proceedings or orders in this Action, shall be offered into evidence in the 13D Action or any other action or proceeding, nor may they cite to this Settlement as grounds for arguing the strength or infirmity of their claims or defenses in the 13D Action.
7.           Plaintiffs counsel will apply to the Court, on notice to counsel for the Settling Defendants and CSX and to the shareholders of CSX, for attorneys fees and expenses in an amount of five hundred fifty thousand dollars ($550,000.00), which application CSX has agreed to support.  Such attorneys fees and expenses as may be awarded by the Court are to be paid by TCI after the Order becomes Final in accordance with paragraph 4(a) and shall reduce the amount of the Settlement Payment to CSX as provided therein, so that, as described in paragraph 4(a), the total payment by TCI will equal $10 million and the total payment by 3G will equal $1 million.  The Settlement is in no way contingent upon any attorneys fees or expenses being awarded in any amount.
 
 
8.           This Stipulation contains the entire agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and neither party is relying upon any representation, promise or assertion not contained herein.
9.           This Stipulation may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original of this Stipulation and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement that no party shall be bound hereby unless and until all parties shall have executed and delivered this Stipulation.
provided
10.           The individuals signing this Stipulation represent that they have the authority to execute this Stipulation, to grant the releases in this Stipulation and to compromise and settle all their claims and their defenses relating to the Action.
11.           This Stipulation may not be modified or amended, nor may any of its provisions be waived, except by a writing signed by all Parties hereto.
12.           The Parties shall use their best efforts to execute such documents and shall take such other reasonable action as is necessary to effectuate this Stipulation as provided for herein.
 
 
13.           The Parties submit to the jurisdiction of this Court (a) for all purposes relating to this Action; and (b) for resolving any disputes over this Stipulation and its enforcement.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
This Notice is given pursuant to an Order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Court).  The purpose of this Notice is to advise of a proposed Settlement (the Settlement) involving defendants, The Childrens Investment Master Fund (TCI), The Childrens Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP, The Childrens Investment Fund Management (Cayman) Ltd., Christopher Hohn, Timothy OToole, 3G Fund LP (3G), 3G Capital Partners Ltd., 3G Capital Partners LP, Alexandre Behring, and Gilbert Lamphere (the Settling Defendants) in the above-captioned action (the Action).  The terms of the Settlement are set forth in a Stipulation of Settlement dated December 16, 2008, on file with the Court.  A hearing will be held before Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Courtroom _______ of the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, New York on ________________, 2009 at ______ _.m. (the Settlement Fairness Hearing) to determine whether the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and to consider the application of Plaintiff for attorneys fees.  The Settlement provides for an aggregate payment by the Settling Defendants of $11,000,000 (the Settlement Payment) to CSX Corporation (CSX).  Counsel for the Plaintiff who brought this Action intends to request that the Court award $550,000 for attorneys fees and expenses.  CSX has agreed to support this application.  Any award of fees and expenses will be paid from the Settlement Payment and such award will reduce the amount of the Settlement Payment to CSX.
 
 
Nature of the Claims and Defenses
The Action affected by this Settlement is based on an amended complaint which was filed by the Plaintiff as a shareholder of CSX and derivatively for its benefit against the Settling Defendants and which asserted claims under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  Section 16(b) permits an issuer of registered equity securities to recover certain trading profits, as defined by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), resulting from the purchase and sale of securities within a period of less than six months by, among others, investors who beneficially owned in excess of 10 percent of the issuers stock.  Recovery under the statute does not turn in any way on the wrongdoing of the defendant; rather, it is based solely on the existence and timing of purchases and sales under the definition of these terms set forth by the SEC rules and judicial decisions.
 
2
 
Plaintiffs theory of liability in this action is based on a June 11, 2008 Opinion and Final Judgment (Opinion) issued in an action entitled , 08 Civ. 2764 (LAK) (the 13D Action), which was brought by CSX against defendants for alleged violations of Section 13(d) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act.  CSX brought the 13D Action in order to restrin the Settling Defendants (other than Timothy OToole and Gilbert Lamphere) from voting or soliciting proxies at CSXs annual meeting on the grounds that they allegedly failed to timely file a Schedule 13D disclosing, among other things, their acquisition of 5 percent of CSXs common stock, and that they had formed a group with the objective of waging a proxy fight to support their nominees to CSXs Board of Directors.  Although the court denied CSXs motion to enjoin defendants from voting or soliciting proxies, it made certain findings in the 13D Action that provide the basis of plaintiffs theory of liability in this Action.  First, the court found that TCI and 3G formed a group and attained beneficial ownership surpassing the 5 percent threshold of stock ownership and failed to timely disclose their ownership plans.  Second, the court found that, under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, TCI may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of CSX common stock owned by several banks that had purchased CSX stock (the Hedged Shares) in order to hedge transactions in cash-settled equity swaps (the equity swaps) that had been initiated by TCI.  Based on the Opinion in the 13D Action, plaintiff in this action alleges that each time TCI entered into an equity swap contract with a bank, the purchase of the Hedged Shares by the bank constituted a purchase by TCI under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act because TCI was the beneficial owner of those shares under Rule 13d-3.  Plaintiff further alleges that each of those purchases is matchable against sales of the Hedged Shares by the banks.    CSX and plaintiff contend that if TCIs transactions in equity swaps during 2007 are deemed to give rise to the beneficial ownership of the Hedged Shares, the maximum disgorgable profits that are recoverable from TCI are as high as $128 million.
CSX Corp. v. The Childrens Investment Fund Management (UK) LLP, et al.
a
CSX established in the 13D Action that, with minor exceptions, whenever TCI terminated a swap agreement or the swap agreement expired, the counterparty bank sold
about
the same number of Hedged Shares and it did so on
or about
the same day that the swap was terminated.
 
3
 
Plaintiffs theory of liability against 3G hinges on another finding in the 13D Action that 3G was a member of a group along with TCI and the other Settling Defendants within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act so that its beneficial ownership reached the 10 percent threshold that must be established for Section 16(b) insider liability to attach.  While 3G purchased and sold CSX common stock, its own beneficial ownership standing alone never exceeded 10 percent of CSX outstanding stock.  Thus, Section 16(b) liability may only be imputed to 3G if (i) it is deemed to be a member of a group with TCI under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act so that its ownership combined with that of other members of the group exceeds the 10 percent threshold and (ii) TCIs equity swaps give rise to beneficial ownership of the Hedged Shares.  CSX and plaintiff contend that if those two conditions are established, 3Gs trading in CSX common stock within six-month periods during 2007 is matchable to yield disgorgable profits of approximately $9.6 million.
Thus, assuming plaintiff could prove the merits of her claims, the maximum recovery on her claims against both 3G and TCI under the current SEC rules governing determination of recoverable profits is alleged to be approximately $137.6 million.
The Settling Defendants deny all allegations of any liability under Section 16(b) and any other assertions of wrongdoing or violations of law.  The Settling Defendants have appealed from the Opinion in the 13D Action and have asked the Second Circuit to reverse and vacate the Opinion and, in particular, the findings that form the bases of plaintiffs theories of liability in this Action -- , that TCIs transactions in equity swaps gave rise to its beneficial ownership of the Hedged Shares and that defendants were members of a Section 13(d)(3) group.
i.e.
 
4
 
The parties recognize that CSX and plaintiffs theory of liability (that TCIs transactions in cash-settled equity swaps give rise to beneficial ownership of the Hedged Shares) is novel and that there is no prior case or rule directly on point.  If the Second Circuit reverses this finding in the 13D Action, there is no basis for liability in this Action against any of the defendants.  Moreover, if the Second Circuit reverses the finding that 3G was a member of a group along with TCI, there is no basis for liability against 3G because it did not beneficially own 10 percent of CSX common stock at any time.
The significant risks and uncertainties arising from the appeal in the 13D Action, and the possibility that a decision in that action is imminent, has prompted the parties to engage in settlement discussions in this Action on an expedited basis before defendants respond to the Complaint in this Action.  Following entry of an order preliminarily approving the proposed settlement of this Action, counsel for the Settling Defendants and CSX will request that the Second Circuit withhold issuing its decision in the 13D Action until the date that the proposed settlement becomes final, within the meaning of  3 of the Settlement, or if the Settlement is not approved, upon entry of an order denying final approval of the Settlement.

CSX obtained substantial discovery in the 13D Action, which proceeded through a full trial on the merits.  Defendants transactions in CSX securities and in equity swaps are described in detail in the 115-page Opinion in the 13D Action.  In addition, counsel for CSXs disinterested directors (i.e., directors who have no financial interest in this litigation and are not affiliated with or nominated by the Settling Defendants) and counsel for CSX engaged a financial expert to analyze and match all of the Settling Defendants transactions in equity swaps and common stock in order to derive the maximum potential recoverable damages under the rules applicable to Section 16(b) claims.  This assumes both that CSX ultimately prevails in the 13D Action on its claims about defendants beneficial ownership and group status and that the Settling Defendants do not prevail on any of their defenses in this Action to plaintiffs Section 16(b) claims, discussed below.
On December 2, 2008, CSX, its disinterested directors and plaintiff, entered into a cooperation agreement which provided for CSX to share its work product and damage analysis with plaintiffs counsel and which provided that plaintiffs counsel may seek an award of fees and expenses up to 5 percent of any settlement amount with a cap of $750,000.  Thereafter, counsel to CSX and its disinterested directors shared with plaintiffs counsel in this Action their damage analysis, the trading records of the Settling Defendants, and the contracts governing TCIs equity swaps so that he could perform his own analysis of the potential damages.  In December 2008, settlement negotiations were conducted by counsel for plaintiff, the Settling Defendants, CSX and CSXs disinterested directors, who are separately represented.

In agreeing to the Settlement, counsel for plaintiff, CSX and the CSX disinterested directors, weighed the risk of an unfavorable outcome if prosecution of this Action is continued; the fact that the claims involve novel legal issues of first impression and ones that are the subject of a hotly-contested appeal in the 13D Action in which numerous have filed briefs in support of and opposition to CSXs position; the fact that the SEC Division of Corporation Finance (the Division) sent a letter to the trial court in the 13D Action stating that [t]he Division believes that interpreting an investors beneficial ownership under Rule 13d-3 to include shares used in a counter-partys hedge, absent unusual circumstances, would be novel and would create significant uncertainties for investors who have used equity swaps in accordance with accepted market practices understood to be based on reasonably well-settled law; the fact that any ruling in this Action is likely to be appealed and that yet additional time would elapse before the final resolution of any such appeal; and counsel further weighed the risk of uncertainty inherent in the outcome of the appeal in the 13D Action, and the attendant costs, against the benefits and certainty of an immediate $11,000,000 cash settlement.  CSX, its disinterested directors, and plaintiff each has determined that the Settlement on the terms described herein is in the best interests of CSX and its shareholders.

Counsel for plaintiff, CSX and its disinterested directors also weighed defenses that counsel for TCI stated it will raise to the claims in this Action, but which are unrelated to the arguments TCI has raised in its appeal in the 13D Action.  Among other things, TCI asserts that the alleged purchases and sales at issue are exempt from Section 16(b) liability pursuant to (1) Rule 16b-6(b)s exemption for converting derivative securities to direct ownership of the underlying security, (2) Section 16(e)s arbitrage exemption, (3) Rule 16a-13s exemption for changes in the form of beneficial ownership, and (4) the unorthodox transaction doctrine.  Those defenses are based on TCIs contention that the alleged purchases and sales at issue arose from transactions in which (a) TCI closed swap positions and acquired equivalent positions in CSX stock, and (b) TCI closed swap positions with certain counterparties and opened the same number of swap positions with other counterparties in order to reduce credit risk.  Because the offsetting purchases and sales took place on or about the same day, and because of CSXs adversity to TCI during the period in question, TCI could not have utilized inside information to speculate on any movement in the price of CSX stock.  In addition, TCI claims that the transactions at issue are exempt from Section 16(b) liability pursuant to Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act because TCI entered into those transactions based on its good faith reliance on, among other things, prior SEC guidance that cash-settled equity swaps did not confer beneficial ownership over the Hedge Shares.  Those defenses are discussed more fully in the brief in support of CSX and plaintiffs joint motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement.  TCI further disputes the correctness of CSXs method of computing damages.  TCI contends that its defenses, if successful, could substantially reduce or eliminate the amount recoverable by CSX.

The Settlement is not and shall not be construed or deemed to be evidence or an admission or concession on the part of the Settling Defendants of any fault or liability whatsoever, and the Settling Defendants do not concede any merit to plaintiffs theories or any infirmity in the defenses that they have raised in the 13D Action, or that they would assert in this Action if it was litigated to judgment.

The Terms of Settlement
Pursuant to the Settlement, the Settling Defendants have agreed to pay to CSX the sum of $11,000,000.  In return this Action will be dismissed as against the Settling Defendants on the merits and with prejudice.  In addition, if the Settlement is approved, the Court will enter a final Order and Judgment which provides for a dismissal of the Complaint and a release and bar order in the following form:
The Amended Complaint, each claim for relief therein against the Settling Defendants and their Related Parties and all claims for violations of Section 16(b) that were asserted in this Action or could have been asserted in any amended complaint against the Settling Defendants or their Related Parties, are hereby dismissed on the merits, with prejudice and without costs, except as otherwise provided in the award of an attorneys fee, costs and disbursements provided for herein; and the Settling Defendants and their Related Parties are hereby discharged and released, except as noted in the final sentence hereof, from any and all liability and damages under or based upon any and all claims, rights, causes of action, suits, matters, demands, transactions and issues, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to the assertions contained in the Amended Complaint in this Action or that could have been asserted in this Action (i) by Plaintiff on behalf of herself or any other person or entity, (ii) by CSX and/or (iii) by any and all owners of any security (as defined in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act) of CSX or any other security or instrument, the value of which is derived from the value of any CSX equity security, or any of them, whether individually, directly, representatively, derivatively or in any other capacity for all claims arising out of or relating to any violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under Section 16(b) relating to trading in CSX securities, equity swaps and/or other equity securities or instruments the value of which is derived from the value of any CSX equity security, from the beginning of time up through the date that this Settlement becomes Final under paragraph 3 of the Settlement.  Plaintiff and her counsel in this Action are enjoined from bringing any claims against the Settling Defendants and their Related Parties for trading in CSX securities, including, without limitation, equity swaps or any other derivative security or instrument tied to the value of any CSX equity security arising from or relating to transactions in such securities or instruments, up through the date that this Settlement becomes Final under paragraph 3 of the Settlement, regardless of the theory of liability.  Nothing herein extends to or releases CSXs claims and the defendants defenses in the 13D Action.

Because the Action was brought derivatively on behalf of CSX, the Settlement Payments will be paid to CSX, net of any award by the Court of an attorneys fee and reimbursement of expenses to plaintiffs counsel.  There will be no distribution to shareholders.
If the Settlement is approved by the Court, all claims that were asserted or could have been asserted against the Settling Defendants in the Action will be dismissed on the merits and with prejudice as to CSX and all of its shareholders and CSX and its shareholders and plaintiff and her counsel will be forever barred from prosecuting this Action or any other action raising any of the claims in this Action against the Settling Defendants.
If the District Court does not approve the Settlement, or if the Order approving the Settlement is reversed on appeal, then the rights and duties of the respective parties to the terminated Settlement will revert to their respective statuses as of the date immediately prior to the execution of the Settlement.
