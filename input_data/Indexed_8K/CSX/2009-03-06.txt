Item 8.01.  Other Events
Section 16(b) Settlement
On March 5, 2009, a federal court in New York signed an order and final judgment (the Order) approving a settlement reached by all parties to a civil action brought by plaintiff, Deborah Donoghue, a shareholder of CSX Corporation (CSX), to recover so-called short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) alleged to have been realized by defendants The Childrens Investment Fund and 3G Capital Partners LP in connection with their purchases and sales of CSX securities.  The Order will become final following entry, either by expiration of the time for appeal or review of the Order or, if any appeal is filed and not dismissed, after the Order is affirmed on appeal and is no longer subject to review upon appeal or by writ of certiorari or motion for reconsideration.  CSX will receive $10 million from The Childrens Investment Fund and $1 million from 3G Capital Partners LP, less $550,000 for attorneys fee and expenses, no later than the tenth business day after the Order becomes final, and the defendants will be released from claims of violations of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
 
             
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
