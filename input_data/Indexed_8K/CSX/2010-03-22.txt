CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX; and CSX) today announced the expiration of its offers to exchange certain of its outstanding debt securities described below (the Existing Notes) for a new series of 6.220% Notes due 2040 (the New Notes) and cash (the Exchange Offers). The Exchange Offers, which commenced on February 22, 2010, expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time on March 19, 2010 (the Expiration Date).
Jacksonville, Fla.  March 22, 2010 
 
On March 24, 2010, CSX expects to deliver an aggregate principal amount of approximately $660,000,000 of New Notes and will pay approximately $140,696,730 cash consideration for the Existing Notes accepted for exchange, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Existing Notes.
 
According to information provided by the exchange agent for the Exchange Offers, CSX received valid tenders from holders of approximately $320,774,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.450% Notes due 2038 (CUSIP No. 126408GP2), approximately $208,348,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.950% Debentures due 2027 (CUSIP No. 126408BM4) and approximately $34,195,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.625% Debentures due 2022 (CUSIP No.126408AM5) (collectively, the First Priority Existing Notes).  In addition, according to information provided by the exchange agent for the Exchange Offers, CSX received valid tenders from holders of approximately $24,510,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.100% Debentures due 2022 (CUSIP No. 126408AQ6) and approximately $123,866,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.900% Debentures due 2017 (CUSIP No. 126408BL6). This information is preliminary and may change.
 
Based on the amount of Existing Notes tendered in the Exchange Offers and in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offers, CSX will accept (1) without proration, all of the First Priority Existing Notes validly tendered as set forth above, (2) without proration, all of the 8.100% Debentures due 2022, validly tendered as set forth above and (3) on a prorated basis, approximately $72,173,000 of the 7.900% Debentures due 2017 validly tendered as set forth above.  The proration factor for the 7.900% Debentures due 2017 will be approximately 58% of the aggregate principal amount of such 7.900% Debentures due 2017 validly tendered as set forth above.
 
 
 
 
The Exchange Offers are being conducted upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offering memorandum dated February 22, 2010 and the related letter of transmittal. The Exchange Offers are only made, and copies of the offering documents will only be made available, to a holder of the Existing Notes who has certified its status as (1) a qualified institutional buyer as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), or (2) a person who is not a U.S. person as defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act.
 
The New Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.
 
This press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Exchange Offers are being made solely by the offering memorandum and related letter of transmittal and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as is permitted under applicable law.
