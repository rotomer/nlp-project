On May 4, 2011, the Board also approved a three-for-one split of the Common Stock (the Stock Split). Each holder of record of CSX Common Stock at the close of business on May 31, 2011 will receive two additional shares of CSX Common Stock for each share of CSX Common Stock held on that date. The additional shares resulting from the Stock Split will be distributed on June 15, 2011. Stockholders will receive a direct registration (book-entry) statement for the additional shares of CSX Common Stock to be issued in the Stock Split and will not need to exchange existing stock certificates.
