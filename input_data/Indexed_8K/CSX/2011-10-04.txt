Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.16(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (or, in the case of a Change in Law, any incremental material unreimbursed cost or expense) or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f).  If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.16(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

(iii)        If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that the

Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
 
SECTION 2.17.   .

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension at the same applicable rate.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(a)
 
(b)           If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c)           Except as provided in Sections 2.09(a) and 2.10(d) with respect to Loans of a Non-Approving Lender, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may, subject to Section 9.08,
provided
 
 
43
 
 
exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
(e)           If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
SECTION 2.18.   .    If any Lender or a Participant in such Lenders Loans requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or a Participant in such Lenders Loans or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Participant pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender or Participant shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Participant, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender or Participant to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Participant.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or Participant in connection with any such designation or assignment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender and Participant shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect upon the Borrower of any increased capital requirement and shall assess any cost related to such increased capital on a nondiscriminatory basis among the Borrower and other borrowers of such Lender or Participant to which such cost applies and such Lender or Participant shall not be entitled to be compensated for any increased capital requirement unless it is, as a result of such law, regulation, guideline or request, such Lenders or Participants policy generally to seek to exercise such rights, where available, against other borrowers of such Lender or Participant.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a)
 
(b)           If any Lender or a Participant in such Lenders Loans requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or Participant or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Participant pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender shall have a credit rating of C/D (or its equivalent) or lower by Thomson BankWatch, Inc. (or any successor thereto), then the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole expense, upon
 
 
44
 
 
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank) which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.19.  
Defaulting  Lenders
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)  fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
(b)  the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Majority Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.2); , that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby;
provided
(c)  if LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)            all or any part of LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure plus such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments;
(ii)           if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
 
 
45
 
 
(iii)          if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)          if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and (b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
(v)           if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d)  so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.05(j), and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

Houston, TX 22002-8069
and
The Lenders Listed on Schedule 1 Hereto
I am an General Counsel of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (Company), and have acted in such capacity in connection with that certain Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2011 (the Credit Agreement), among the Company, the financial institutions listed on the signature pages thereof as Lenders (the Lenders), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent), Citibank, N.A., Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as syndication agents, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., PNC Bank, National Association, The Northern Trust Company and UBS Securities LLC, as documentation agents.  This opinion is rendered to you in compliance with subsection 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the same meanings as in the Credit Agreement.
In my capacity as such counsel, I have examined the originals, or copies identified to my satisfaction as being true copies of such records, documents or other instruments as in my judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable me to render the opinions expressed below.  These records, documents and instruments included the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon representations made to me by each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the Parties) (including the representations of the Company contained in the Credit Agreement).  In addition, I have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from public officials as I have deemed necessary, copies of which have been delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
In my review and examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original and certified documents except with respect to the Parties, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to original or certified documents of all documents submitted to me as conformed or photostatic copies.
 
I have investigated such questions of law for the purpose of rendering this opinion as I have deemed necessary.  I am opining herein as to the effect on the subject transactions of only United States Federal law, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the Subject Laws).
 
On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth below, I am of the opinion that:
 
1.      Each of Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction such qualification is required.
 
2.      The Transactions are within the Companys corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company.
 
3.      The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or the charter, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority under the Subject Laws, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any material payment to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any material asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
 
 
 
 
4.      There is no pending litigation or administrative proceeding or other legal or regulatory development that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to materially adversely affect the rights and remedies of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement.
 
5.      Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications and comments:
 
(a)           My opinions in paragraph 3 above as to compliance with certain statutes, rules and regulations are based upon a review of those statutes, rules and regulations which, in my experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the same type as the Transactions, and statutes, rules and regulations applicable to corporations conducting businesses similar to those conducted by the Parties.
 
(b)           To the extent that the obligations of any Party may be dependent upon such matters, I have assumed for purposes of this opinion, other than with respect to any Party, that each additional party to the agreements and contracts referred to herein is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; that each such other party has the requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to perform its obligations under such agreements and contracts, as applicable; and that such agreements and contracts have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and each of them constitutes the legally valid and binding obligation of, such other parties, as applicable, enforceable against such other parties in accordance with their respective terms.  Except as expressly covered in this opinion, I am not expressing any opinion as to the effect of compliance by any Lender with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the Transactions because of the nature of any of its businesses.
 
This opinion is rendered only to the Administrative Agent and Lenders and is solely for their benefit in connection with the Transactions.  This opinion may not be relied upon by the Administrative Agent or Lenders for any other purpose, or quoted to or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose without my prior written consent.  Finally, I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the matters addressed herein which may come to my attention after the date hereof.
