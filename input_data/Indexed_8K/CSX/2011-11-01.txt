In addition, such counsel shall state that he or she has, or persons under his or her supervision have, participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors for the Company, the Representatives and Counsel for the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto and related matters were discussed, and, although such counsel has not undertaken to investigate or verify independently, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that would lead such counsel to believe (A) that the Registration Statement (other than the historical, pro forma, projected or other financial statements, information and data and statistical information and data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and Form T-1, in each case as to which no opinion need be given), at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact, or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) that (i) the
 
Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, and (ii) the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of its date or as of the Closing Date (in each case, other than the historical, pro forma, projected or other financial statements, information and data and statistical information and data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, in each case as to which no opinion need be given), includes or will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all references in this Section 5(b) to the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to include any amendment or supplement thereto at the Closing Date.
(c) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters the opinion and negative assurance letter of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibits A and B attached hereto.
(d) The Representatives shall have received from Counsel for the Underwriters such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (as amended or supplemented at the Closing Date) and other related matters as they may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. In rendering such opinion, Counsel for the Underwriters may rely as to all matters governed by Virginia law on the opinion of the Senior Vice President  Law and Public Affairs and Corporate Secretary, General Counsel or Assistant General Counsel of the Company, referred to above.
(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President or the Assistant Vice President  Capital Markets and another person who is the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, or, in their absence, other proper officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto and this Agreement and that, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date; and
(ii) since the date of the most recent financial statements incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one
 
enterprise, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto after the date hereof) or as described in such certificate.
(f) At the Applicable Time and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives letters, dated respectively as of the Applicable Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus.
(g) Subsequent to the Applicable Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to market the Notes as contemplated by the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereof or thereto after the date hereof).
(h) Subsequent to the Applicable Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Group or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to the Representatives such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and Counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Notes may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or telefax confirmed in writing.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 will be delivered at the office of Counsel for the Underwriters, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, on the Closing Date.
6. . If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because of cancellation by the Representatives pursuant to Section 5 hereof, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any material agreement herein or comply with any material provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters in payment for the Notes on the Closing Date, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of Counsel for the Underwriters) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Notes.
Reimbursement of Expenses
7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(I)(c) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and each Underwriter
 
acknowledge that the statements set forth in the fourth paragraph, fifth paragraph, twelfth paragraph, thirteenth paragraph and fourteenth paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the fourth paragraph, fifth paragraph, twelfth paragraph, thirteenth paragraph and fourteenth paragraph of text under the heading "Underwriting" in the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto).
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel); however, the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel only if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded upon advice of counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 7 to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise, or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
provided
however
 
(d) If the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and by the Underwriters from the offering of the Notes. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company in connection with the purchase of the Notes hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 7(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.
Losses
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Notes set forth
Default by an Underwriter
 
opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that if the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Notes within 36 hours of such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except as otherwise provided in Section 10. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or to any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the applicable Notes, if prior to such time (i) there shall have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which, in the judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Notes, (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating), (iii) trading in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (iv) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereof or thereto after the date hereof).
Termination
10. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
 
11. . The Company covenants and agrees with the Representatives that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the issue of the Notes and all other expenses in connection with the preparation and printing of the Final Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters; (ii) the cost of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes as provided in Section 4(I)(a); (iii) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Notes; (iv) the cost of preparing the Notes; (v) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Notes; (vi) any fees charged by DTC; (vii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale under state and Canadian securities laws, including the fees and disbursements of Counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with Blue Sky and Legal Investment Survey and Canadian offering documents; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 11. It is understood, however, that except as provided in Sections 6 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees, disbursements and expenses of their counsel and any marketing expenses connected with any offers they may make.

November 1, 2011
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
  as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in
  Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated October 27, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2042 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of August 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007 and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 24, 2010 (collectively, the "Indenture").
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
 
We have also reviewed the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-164978) (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 27, 2011 relating to the Securities, the pricing term sheet listed on Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement, and the prospectus supplement dated October 27, 2011 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement became effective under the Act and the Indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), upon the filing of the registration statement with the Commission on February 19, 2010 pursuant to Rule 462(e). To our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act. The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated February 19, 2010 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Indenture and the Securities. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects. The statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, fairly and accurately summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
In rendering the opinions in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, we have assumed that each party to the Indenture, the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the "Documents") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, injunction, order or decree or any agreement or other instrument binding upon such party, that we make no such assumption to the extent that we have specifically opined as to such matters with respect to the Company, and (ii) each Document (other than the Underwriting Agreement) is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than as expressly covered above in respect of the Company).
provided

Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
  as Representatives of the several Underwriters named in
  Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement referred to below
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated October 27, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement") with you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto under which you and such other Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2042 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of August 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007 and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 24, 2010 (collectively, the "Indenture").
We have reviewed the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-164978) (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the preliminary prospectus supplement dated October 27, 2011
 
(the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") relating to the Securities, the pricing term sheet listed on Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement, and the prospectus supplement dated October 27, 2011 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents and the information deemed to be part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated February 19, 2010 relating to the Shelf Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, together with the pricing term sheet listed on Schedule III to the Underwriting Agreement for the Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosure Package." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available by the Company to the Underwriters to meet requests of purchasers of the Securities under Rule 173 under the Act), is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."
We have assumed the conformity of the documents filed with the Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"), except for required EDGAR formatting changes, to physical copies of the documents submitted for our examination.
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or quantitative information. Furthermore, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion separately delivered to you today in respect of certain matters under the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. As a result, we are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and we have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished in such documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in our opinion letter separately delivered to you today as to statements included in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Notes" and "Certain Tax Considerations"). However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the review of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, we have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and your counsel and with certain officers and employees of, and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. We have also reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters.
On the basis of the information gained in the course of the performance of the services rendered above, but without independent check or verification except as stated above:
 
 
 
 
 
In providing this letter to you and the other several Underwriters, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no view regarding, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1. In addition, we express no view as to the conveyance of the Disclosure Package or the information contained therein to investors.
This letter is delivered solely to you and the other several Underwriters in connection with the Underwriting Agreement. This letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (including any person acquiring Securities from the several Underwriters) or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,

Exhibit 4.2
UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY SECURITY ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
TRANSFERS OF THIS SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE, BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF CEDE & CO. OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE.
 
This security (the "Security") is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (hereinafter called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, limited as to aggregate principal amount, dated as of August 1, 1990 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, NA.), successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture (as hereinafter defined)), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007 and an Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 24, 2010, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (the indenture, as supplemented being herein called the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series has been issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000 (SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS). All Securities of this series need not be issued at the same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of any Holder, for issuances of additional Securities of this series. Any such additional
Securities of this series will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those initially issued. Further Securities of this series may also be authenticated and delivered as provided by Sections 304, 305, 306 or 906 of the Indenture. This Security represents an aggregate initial principal amount of $[500,000,000] ([FIVE] HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) (adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, the "Principal Amount") of the Securities of such series, with the Interest Payment Dates, date of original issuance, and date of Maturity specified herein and bearing interest on said Principal Amount at the interest rate specified herein.
The Company, for value received, hereby promises to pay CEDE & CO, or its registered assigns, the principal sum of [$500,000,000] ([FIVE] HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS) on May 30, 2042 and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon from November 1, 2011 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, or, if the date of this Security is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, then from the date hereof, semiannually in arrears on May 30 and November 30 of each year, commencing May 30, 2012, and at Maturity at the rate of 4.750% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the Security. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the May 15 or November 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or quoted, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or system, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest payable on this Security at Maturity will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable.
This Security is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for definitive Registered Securities of this series only as provided in this paragraph. If (x) the Depository with respect to the Securities of this series (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling, unable or ineligible to continue as Depository for this Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities and executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order providing that this Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have happened and be continuing an Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of the series of which this Security is a part, this
Security or any portion hereof shall, in the case of clause (x) above, be exchanged for definitive Registered Securities of this series, and in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, be exchangeable for definitive Registered Securities of this series, provided that the definitive Security so issued in exchange for this Security shall be in authorized denominations and be of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the portion of the Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, definitive Registered Securities of this series will be issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, only if such definitive Registered Securities were requested by written notice to the Security Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is a beneficial owner of an interest herein given through the Holder hereof. Any definitive Registered Security of this series issued in exchange for this Security, or any portion hereof, shall be registered in the name or names of such Person or Persons as the Holder hereof shall instruct the Security Registrar. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Any exchange of this Security or portion hereof for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series will be made at the New York office of the Security Registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by the Company for that purpose. Upon exchange of any portion of this Security for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, the Trustee shall endorse Exhibit A of this Security to reflect the reduction of its Principal Amount by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the definitive Registered Securities of this series so issued in exchange, whereupon the Principal Amount hereof shall be reduced for all purposes by the amount so exchanged and noted. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Indenture, until exchanged in full for one or more definitive Registered Securities of this series, this Security shall in all respects be subject to and entitled to the same benefits and conditions under the Indenture as a duly authenticated and delivered definitive Registered Security of this series.
The principal and any interest in respect of any portion of this Security payable in respect of an Interest Payment Date or at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case occurring prior to the exchange of such portion for a definitive Registered Security or Securities of this series, will be paid, as provided herein, to the Holder hereof which will undertake in such circumstances to credit any such principal and interest received by it in respect of this Security to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such interests on such Interest Payment Date or at Stated Maturity. If a definitive Registered Security or Registered Securities of this series are issued in exchange for any portion of this Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, then interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case maybe, only to the Holder hereof, and the Holder hereof will undertake in such circumstances to credit such interest to the account or accounts of the Persons who were the beneficial owners of such portion of this Security on such Regular Record Date or Special Record Date, as the case may be.
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the offices of the Trustee as Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts by check mailed to the registered Holders thereof; provided, however, that at the option of the Holder, payment of interest may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Person entitled hereto as such account shall be provided to the Security Registrar and shall appear in the Security Register.
The Securities shall be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time. If the Securities are redeemed prior to the date that is six months prior to the Maturity date, the Redemption Price for the Securities to be redeemed shall equal the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date:
 
 
If the Securities are redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the Maturity date, the redemption price for the Securities to be redeemed will equal 100% of the principal amount of such Securities, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date:
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. The Company shall notify the Trustee, in an Officers' Certificate, of the Redemption Price no later than the second Business Day preceding the Redemption Date. The Officers' Certificate shall set forth the Redemption Price both as an aggregate amount for all the Securities to be redeemed and as an amount per $1,000.00 in principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, subject to a minimum $2,000.00 denomination as set forth below.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (A) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and their successors, or if they are unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment and banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means:
 
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 1104 of the Indenture; provided, that such notice shall not be required to include the Redemption Price but shall instead include the manner of calculation of the Redemption Price. If the Company elects to partially redeem the Securities, the Trustee will select in a fair and appropriate manner the Securities to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series (including this Security and the interests represented hereby) may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Upon payment (i) of the amount of principal so declared due and payable and (ii) of interest on any overdue principal and overdue interest (in each case to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and any interest on the Securities of this series (including this Security and the interests represented hereby) shall terminate.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company have exercised the Company's right to redeem the "Securities" as described above, the Company will be required to make an offer to each holder of the "Securities" to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's "Securities" at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the "Securities" repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the "Securities" repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Control will mail a notice to each holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the "Securities" on the payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the "Securities" as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the "Securities", the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached the Company's obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the "Securities" by virtue of such conflict.
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of the "Securities" properly tendered the purchase price for the "Securities", and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any "Securities" surrendered; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the "Securities" upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all the "Securities" properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
For purposes of the foregoing description of a repurchase at the option of holders, the following definitions are applicable:
"Below Investment Grade Ratings Event" means that on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the "Securities" is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a Change of Control; or (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by CSX to effect a Change of Control, the "Securities" are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the ratings event).
"Change of Control" means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than CSX or the Company's subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.
"Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event.
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings Ltd.
"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P or Fitch (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P and Fitch); or the equivalent Investment Grade credit rating from any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating Agency" means (1) each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch; and (2) if any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to rate the "Securities" or fails to make a rating of the "Securities" publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer) as a replacement agency for Moody's, S&P or Fitch, or all of them, as the case may be.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc.

The provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture apply to Securities of this series.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and the Persons who are beneficial owners of interests represented hereby, and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for CSX Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-164978) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), for the registration by the Company of $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2042 (the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture dated as of August 1, 1990, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 15, 1991, the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 6, 1997, the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 22, 1998, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 30, 2001, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 27, 2003, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 23, 2004, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 25, 2007 and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 24, 2010 (collectively, the "Indenture").
We, as your counsel, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
Based upon the foregoing, we advise you that, in our opinion that, when the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the Indenture against payment therefor, the Securities will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability, provided that we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any waiver of rights under any usury or stay law.
In rendering the opinion above, we have assumed that each party to the Indenture and the Securities (collectively, the "Documents") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. In addition, we have assumed that (i) the execution, delivery and performance by each party thereto of each Document to which it is a party, (a) are within its corporate powers, (b) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constitutive documents of such party, (c) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental
 
 
body, agency or official and (d) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or any judgment, and (ii) each Document is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of each party thereto (other than the Company).
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York, except that we express no opinion as to any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on the date hereof and its incorporation by reference into the Registration Statement. In addition, we consent to the reference to our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the prospectus supplement, which is a part of the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
