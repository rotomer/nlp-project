Exhibit 99.1
CSX Announces Record First Quarter Results
Year-Over-Year Highlights:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
- April 17, 2012 - CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today announced first quarter net earnings of $449 million, or $0.43 per share, versus $395 million, or $0.35 per share, in the same period last year. This represents a 23 percent year-over-year improvement in earnings per share.
CSX is off to a fast start in a year that will be dynamic and challenging, said Michael J. Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer. A significant majority of our transportation markets are performing very well and our operations are delivering excellent results.
Revenue in the quarter improved 6 percent from the prior year to nearly $3 billion, driven by increased volume, pricing gains and fuel recovery. Overall volume was up 1 percent in the quarter when compared to the same period last year. Increased shipments in merchandise and intermodal more than offset declines in the company's coal business.
The higher revenue coupled with the company's focus on service, productivity and cost control drove an 11 percent increase in operating income to a first quarter record $856 million and a record first quarter operating ratio of 71.1 percent, a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year.
Although utility coal-related headwinds are likely to be stronger in the second quarter, CSX remains on track to achieve year-over-year earnings growth in 2012, said Ward.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Quarterly Financial Report available on the company's website at
http://investors.csx.com
and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
CSX executives will conduct a quarterly earnings conference call with the investment community on April 18, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. Investors, media and the public may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-327-6279 (888-EARN-CSX) and asking for the CSX earnings call. (Callers outside the U.S., dial 1-773-756-0199). Participants should dial in 10 minutes prior to the call. In conjunction with the call, a live webcast will be accessible and presentation materials will be posted on the company's website at
http://investors.csx.com
. Following the earnings call, an internet replay of the presentation will be archived on the company website.

VOLUME AND REVENUE
Although utility coal is challenged by low natural gas prices and high stock piles, the Company achieved year-over-year revenue growth in nearly all markets. Additionally, there was an overall increase in volume led by intermodal and merchandise markets. Ongoing emphasis on pricing above rail inflation, along with higher fuel recovery associated with the increase in fuel prices, drove revenue-per-unit increases in substantially all markets.
Merchandise
Agricultural
Agricultural Products
- Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of ethanol and export grain. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of reduced gasoline demand and limitations on the maximum amount that can be held at storage facilities due to over-production. Export grain volume decreased due to higher U.S. commodity prices as compared to other countries.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
- Fertilizer shipments declined as the expectation of falling commodity prices resulted in delayed purchases. Revenue per unit was down as increased shipments of short-haul phosphates offset core pricing and fuel recovery.
Food and Consumer
- Volume increased driven by strength in refrigerated products due to highway-to-rail conversions resulting from tight truck capacity.
Industrial
Chemicals
- Overall, volume was flat with strength in plastics resulting from inventory restocking and frac sand (used in the extraction of gas and petroleum) resulting from the increase in natural gas drilling. This strength was offset by weakness in liquefied petroleum gas (used as heating fuel) which decreased due to an unseasonably warm winter.
    
Automotive
- Automotive volume grew as North American automotive production increased to meet pent up demand.
Metals
- Volume grew in both scrap shipments and finished steel products resulting from strong demand in the automotive and energy markets for products such as sheet steel, pipe and steel bars.
Housing and Construction
Emerging Markets
- Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several major construction projects and salt which declined from reduced road application due to the mild winter.
Forest Products
- Volume improved mostly due to recovering demand for housing and construction. The paper markets also improved with strong shipments of pulpboard for packaging of consumer products as a result of increased consumer spending.
Coal
Shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices, an unusually warm winter and utility stockpiles above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal.
Intermodal
Domestic growth was driven by increased customer demand and highway conversions, and international growth was driven by new customers and the associated growth from expanded service offerings. The increase in revenue per unit was attributable to favorable mix, yield improvement and higher fuel recovery due to rising fuel prices.
