Exhibit 99.1
CSX Announces Second Quarter Results
Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Year-Over-Year Continuing Earnings Growth
Year-Over-Year Highlights:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
- July 17, 2012 - CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today announced second quarter net earnings of $512 million, or $0.49 per share, versus $506 million, or $0.46 per share, in the same period last year. This represents a 7 percent year-over-year improvement in earnings per share.
CSX delivered its 10
th
straight quarter of year-over-year earnings growth despite significant headwinds in its utility coal business, said Michael J. Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer. The company continues to perform well across a wide range of economic and market conditions.
Total revenue and volume were essentially flat when compared to the same period last year, as increased shipments of export coal, intermodal and automotive products helped offset declines in utility coal.
CSX's train crews are operating more efficiently and the company's strong service product is translating into better asset utilization. These productivity gains, along with resource alignments made in response to changes in the mix of the business, drove an increase in operating income to $943 million. Additionally, the operating ratio improved to 68.7 percent for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year.
This team remains focused on the safety of our employees and communities, service to our customers, and productivity in our operations, said Ward. CSX employees delivered record employee safety results and a significant improvement in the train accident rate.
Looking forward, even with the continued headwinds in the utility coal market, CSX remains on track for earnings growth for the full-year 2012. In addition, while more challenging, the company continues to have line of sight to a 65 percent operating ratio by 2015.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Quarterly Financial Report available on the company's website at
http://investors.csx.com
and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(a) 2011 intermodal revenue has been reduced by $7 million and $12 million for the quarter and six months ended July 1, 2011, respectively, from what was previously reported to correct for certain interline business and the corresponding intermodal revenue per unit has been reduced for this as well. The offsetting adjustment is reported in other revenue.

CSX Corporation
VOLUME AND REVENUE
The Company achieved year-over-year revenue growth in most markets although domestic utility coal volume continues to face challenges resulting from low natural gas prices and high stockpiles. The volume decline in domestic utility coal was offset by volume growth in the export coal, intermodal and automotive markets. Additionally, with the exception of coal which was flat, revenue per unit increased in all markets reflecting higher yields and fuel recovery.
Merchandise
Agricultural
Agricultural Products
- Volume decreased due to reduced shipments of ethanol and corn. Ethanol shipments declined as a result of reduced gasoline demand and limitations at storage facilities due to over-production. Corn shipments to the Southeast for animal feed were lower due to substitution from a strong local wheat crop.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
- Fertilizer shipments declined as the expectation of moderating prices for finished phosphate products (which include crop nutrients) resulted in delayed purchases.
Food and Consumer
- Volume decreased with lower shipments of appliances driven by intermodal conversions partially offset by strength in refrigerated products shipments due to highway-to-rail conversions resulting from tight truck capacity.
Industrial
Chemicals
- Volume growth was driven by oil and gas-related markets (which include frac sand and petroleum oil) resulting from the increase in shale drilling activity.
    
Automotive
- Automotive volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased 25% year-over-year to support the continuing recovery of the automotive market.
Metals
- Volume declined primarily due to scrap shipments related to weak exports as a result of lower global demand. The decline was likely increased by purchasing delays attributable to expectations for future reduction in scrap prices. These trends were partially offset by growth in finished steel products from strong demand in energy markets for products such as pipe and steel bars.
Housing and Construction
Emerging Markets
- Volume declined due to reduced shipments of aggregates (which include crushed stone, sand and gravel) resulting from the completion of several major construction projects. Shipments of salt also declined from higher stockpiles due to the milder winter weather.
Forest Products
- Volume improved mostly due to recovering demand for housing and construction.
Coal
Shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export shipments of U.S. thermal coal.
Intermodal
Domestic growth was driven by new customers, benefits of new capacity and highway conversions. International growth was driven by a new customer.

EXPENSE
Expenses in the quarter decreased $24 million from last year's second quarter. Significant variances are described below.
Labor and Fringe
expense decreased $20 million due to the following:
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense decreased $7 million due to the following:
Fuel
expense decreased $21 million primarily due to volume and a 2% decrease in the average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. (See Fuel Statistics table below)
Depreciation
expense increased $17 million due to a larger asset base.
(a) Average headcount includes employees who are on a furlough retention board which means that they are guaranteed two days of service per week as well as full health and welfare benefits in exchange for remaining available to work when needed.  The average employees with this status was 227 employees for the second quarter 2012 versus 8 employees for the quarter last year.  These boards are different than a traditional furlough where an employee does not receive guaranteed minimum weekly service and forfeits health and welfare benefits after a defined period of time without service.
