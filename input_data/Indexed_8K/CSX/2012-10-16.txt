Exhibit 99.1
CSX Announces Third Quarter Results
Year-Over-Year Highlights:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.
- October 16, 2012 - CSX Corporation (NYSE: CSX) today announced third quarter net earnings of $455 million, down 2 percent when compared to the $464 million reported in the same period last year. Despite this decline, the company's earnings per share in the quarter were up 2 percent year-over-year to $0.44 compared to $0.43 in the third quarter last year. The contrast between the changes in net earnings and EPS is reflective of shares repurchased since last year's third quarter.
CSX continues to respond well to moderating economic conditions and challenges in our domestic coal business, said Michael J. Ward, chairman, president and chief executive officer. The company is driving strong safety, customer service and productivity results while building its capabilities for the long term.
While the company saw strong increases in export coal, intermodal and automotive shipments, total revenue in the quarter declined 2 percent when compared to the same period last year. This decline was driven by overall lower volume levels, a change in the mix of the company's business and lower fuel recovery.
However, strong productivity gains, coupled with adjusting resources throughout the business, allowed the company to offset external headwinds and deliver operating income of $854 million, down 3 percent compared to last year. In addition, the operating ratio performed well, remaining stable at 70.5 percent for the quarter, versus 70.4 percent last year.
Looking forward, CSX still expects earnings growth and margin expansion for the full-year 2012. In addition, the company is still targeting a 65 percent operating ratio by 2015, although this has become more challenging in the current environment.
This earnings announcement, as well as a package of detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Quarterly Financial Report available on the company's website at
http://investors.csx.com
and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CSX Corporation
(a) 2011 intermodal revenue has been reduced by $6 million and $18 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, from what was previously reported to correct for certain interline business and the corresponding intermodal revenue per unit has been reduced for this as well. The offsetting adjustment is reported in other revenue.

CSX Corporation
VOLUME AND REVENUE
Volume declined 1% year-over-year as lower coal shipments were partially offset by the increase in intermodal and automotive volume. Pricing gains drove increases in revenue per unit in nearly all markets. Total revenue for the Company declined 2% year-over-year due to lower volume, lower fuel surcharge recoveries, partially offset by pricing gains.
Merchandise
Agricultural
Agricultural Products
- Volume decreased due to lower shipments of corn and ethanol. Corn shipments for animal feed declined as the extreme drought in the Midwest impacted harvest levels and drove corn prices higher. Further contributing to this decline, customers in the Southeast took advantage of a strong local crop which was delivered by truck. Ethanol shipments were lower as a result of a reduction in gasoline demand.
Phosphates and Fertilizers
- Fertilizer volume was flat as increased domestic shipments were offset by lower export volume. Domestic shipments increased as some business shifted to rail from barge transportation due to the low river levels. Increased shipments to domestic markets limited the availability of fertilizer for exports.
Food and Consumer
- Volume increased due to a larger year-over-year potato crop and increased rail shipments of western apples to replace the weak crop in the Midwest which is typically moved by truck to customers.
Industrial
Chemicals
- Volume growth was driven by an increase in plastics shipments to support growth in a broad base of end-use markets including packaging and automotive. Additionally, frac sand and petroleum oil shipments increased from shale drilling related activity.
Automotive
- Automotive volume grew as North American light vehicle production increased to meet pent up demand as the average vehicle age in the U.S. reached record highs.
Metals
-
Scrap volume declined due to lower steel mill utilization rates resulting from decreased demand and falling scrap prices.
Housing and Construction
Emerging Markets
- Volume declined due to reduced shipments of salt as inventories remain high due to reduced road application during the previous mild winter. Additionally, waste volume declined due to the conclusion of several remediation projects and an increase of local landfill disposal options that favor truck.
Forest Products
- Strength in building products from the slowly-recovering demand for housing and construction was offset by weakness in the paper markets, which continue to be affected by electronic media substitution.
Coal
Shipments of utility coal declined primarily driven by low natural gas prices and utility stockpiles above target levels. This decrease was partially offset by higher export volume driven by increased shipments of U.S. thermal coal primarily to Europe.
Intermodal
Domestic growth was driven by highway-to-rail conversions, the addition of service lanes and growth with existing business partners. International growth was driven by a new customer and growth from expanded service offerings primarily enabled by the Northwest Ohio terminal.
Other
Other revenue increased due to lower volume-based incentives paid to customers and higher revenue from customers who did not meet minimum contractual volumes.

CSX Corporation
EXPENSE
Expenses in the quarter decreased $45 million from last year's third quarter. Significant variances are described below.
Labor and Fringe
expense decreased $11 million due to the following:
Materials, Supplies and Other
expense decreased $37 million due to the following:
Fuel
expense decreased $15 million primarily due to volume and efficiency, partially offset by a 1% increase in the average price per gallon for locomotive fuel. (See Fuel Statistics table below)
Depreciation
expense increased $17 million due to a larger asset base.
(a) Average headcount includes employees who are on a furlough retention board which means that they are guaranteed two days of service per week as well as full health and welfare benefits in exchange for remaining available to work when needed.  The average employees with this status was approximately 180 for the third quarter 2012 while there were no employees on average with this status for the quarter last year.  These boards are different than a traditional furlough where an employee does not receive guaranteed minimum weekly service and forfeits health and welfare benefits after a defined period of time without service.
