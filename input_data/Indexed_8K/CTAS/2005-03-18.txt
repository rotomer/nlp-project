Scott D. Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to report another solid quarter of performance. Our rental revenue grew 7.5 percent on an organic basis when adjusted for one less workday this quarter, up from an organic growth rate of 6.0 percent in the second quarter and 5.8 percent in the first quarter of this fiscal year. Other services revenue, which is primarily the sale of uniforms and first aid and safety products and services, rose 15.5 percent during the quarter, and 5.7 percent organically when adjusted for the one less workday. Total revenue for the company increased 8.4 percent on a reported basis and 7.1 percent on an organic basis when adjusted for the one less workday."
Mr. Farmer continued, "Our revenue growth continues to accelerate as we add more new customers across all of our business divisions. Recently, we expanded our product and service offerings even further by adding fire protection services, such as fire extinguishers, and further expanding our new Document Management Division to include document storage. The product and service offerings we have today give us the opportunity to achieve our goal of providing a service to every business in the United States and Canada, which encompasses more than 14 million businesses. Today, we serve only 700,000 of those businesses. We are truly expanding into a broader-based business services company as reflected in the recent change in our tagline from to .

Mr. Farmer said, "For the quarter, our gross margins were a solid 42.6 percent versus 42.4 percent of revenue in the third quarter last year. This was achieved despite higher energy prices. In the quarter, selling, general and administrative costs increased to 27.0 percent from 26.5 percent of revenue in the third quarter last year, primarily as a result of continuing to increase our investment in sales and marketing programs and higher healthcare benefit costs."
