Scott D. Farmer, Chief Executive Officer of Cintas, stated, "On behalf of our Cintas employee-partners, I am proud to report these solid results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We grew our total revenue at a double-digit pace. Rental revenue increased 8 percent while Other Services revenue grew 19 percent over the previous year. We continued to show steady improvement in the Company's organic growth rate. This quarter's organic growth rate of 8.4 percent compares to 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005."
Mr. Farmer continued, "Gross margins continued to strengthen as well, rising to 43.2 percent compared to 42.7 percent in last year's first quarter. These margins reflect continued cost reductions and productivity improvements from our Six Sigma initiatives, better capacity utilization and progress in building new business services platforms. These solid results reflect the teamwork and spirit, which our employee-partners exhibit every day at Cintas. We appreciate all of the efforts put forth by our employee-partners across our Company."
In the first quarter, the Company continued its stock repurchase program that the Board of Directors had authorized and announced in May 2005. During the quarter, the Company purchased approximately 2.6 million shares. To date, the Company has purchased approximately 4.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $39.50 per share.
STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN
As of August 31, 2005, the Company had $258 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and total debt to capitalization was 19.8 percent. Total shareholders' equity stood at $2.1 billion as of August 31st.
STRONG BALANCE SHEET
Mr. Farmer stated, "We are continuing to assess the impact of Hurricane Katrina on our operations. While damage to our facilities appears, at this point, to be minimal, the impact on our employee-partners and customers in the affected areas continues to be a major concern to the Company. We are assisting our employee-partners at our operations in New Orleans and Gulfport through salary continuation and other financial assistance. The ultimate cost of this assistance, combined with lower business volume at the affected operations, will have an impact on our results."
REVENUE AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE
Mr. Farmer continued, "Additionally, the rapid increase in the cost of energy could impact our results, unless such costs return to levels seen in our first quarter. All of these factors will impact our Fiscal 2006 results. Although it is too early to know the exact impact, we are reiterating our original revenue and earnings per share guidance for Fiscal 2006. That guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion with full year earnings per share (diluted) in the range of $1.95 to $2.05. However, at this point, our preliminary analysis of the impact of Hurricane Katrina, as well as higher energy costs, could move us to the low end of our earnings per share range. Despite this setback in the Gulf Coast region, our Company is very strong financially and Cintas partners are pulling together as is characteristic of our culture."
