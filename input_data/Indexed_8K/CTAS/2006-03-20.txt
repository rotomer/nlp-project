Corporation
(
Scott D. Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "On behalf of our Cintas employee partners, I am proud to report another quarter of solid results. We achieved double-digit growth in our business and delivered increased profit. For the third quarter, our revenue grew about 8 percent on an organic basis. Our gross margins were strong at 42.2 percent, up from 41.9 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. These results continue to reflect historically high energy costs, which increased approximately 8 percent, or 0.3 percent of revenue, from the second quarter of fiscal 2006. In fact, energy costs have risen 39 percent, or 0.8 percent of revenue, from the third quarter of fiscal 2005."
For the nine months ended February 28, 2006, revenue of $2.50 billion increased 10.5 percent compared to $2.26 billion over the prior year, while earnings per share rose to $1.39 per diluted share from $1.26 per diluted share, a 10.3 percent increase over the prior year.
Mr. Farmer added, "We recently announced our acquisition of certain assets of Van Dyne Crotty, Inc. This acquisition closed three weeks prior to the end of the quarter and we are very pleased with the results and integration progress to date. The Van Dyne Crotty acquisition demonstrates our commitment to the uniform rental industry, but we also continue to expand into other products and services which capitalize on our service expertise and infrastructure. Recently, we expanded our services even further by offering our new Sanis Ultra-Clean service, a restroom cleaning service. We are excited about the long-term potential of this service, which is yet another example of how we have truly become "Cintas, The Service Professionals".
Cintas was also recently included in the NASDAQ Dividend Achievers Index, a new index designed for dividend-focused investors to track the performance of U.S. companies which are listed on NASDAQ and meet certain long-term dividend performance criteria. Mr. Farmer commented, "Our inclusion in this Index is a tribute to our track record of increasing our annual dividend every year since we went public in 1983. During that timeframe, we have increased our dividend by 21 percent on a compound annual basis. We are honored to be identified and included in this new Index."
Strong Balance Sheet
The Company's balance sheet continues to be strong. Despite the increased debt related to the acquisition of certain Van Dyne Crotty assets, debt to total capitalization is only at 22.6 percent as of February 28, 2006, versus 18.5 percent as of February 28, 2005. Cash and marketable securities was $251 million as of February 28, 2006, compared to $368 million a year ago. Total shareholders' equity was $2.2 billion as of February 28, 2006.
Outlook
Mr. Farmer commented, "Our financial results continue to be negatively impacted by the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast region. We are actively pursuing settlement of our losses with our insurance carrier and to date have not offset these losses in our financial statements. Additionally, the rapid rise in energy costs during this fiscal year continues to impact our results and we anticipate continued cost pressure in this area."
Mr. Farmer continued, "Taking these factors into account, we are refining our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2006. For our fiscal year 2006, which ends May 31, 2006, our forecast is for revenue to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.42 billion compared to revenues for fiscal 2005 of $3.07 billion. Our guidance for earnings per diluted share is $1.92 to $1.96 compared to $1.74 for fiscal 2005."
