Cintas
Corporation
Scott D. Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "On behalf of our Cintas employee partners, I am proud to report our first quarter results. We have again achieved double-digit revenue growth and delivered strong operating margins, despite increases in energy costs. Our earnings before interest and taxes improved a healthy 11.8% over the first quarter of fiscal 2006."
Mr. Farmer continued, "The implementation of our new sales structure, which we announced a few months ago, continues to be on schedule. This new structure is designed to develop additional cross-selling opportunities and improve sales productivity. The new sales organization, in conjunction with our vast product and service offerings, is expected to drive improvements in future internal growth."
Strong Balance Sheet
The Company's balance sheet continues to be strong. Despite increased debt levels related to acquisitions made in late fiscal 2006 and the Company's share repurchase program, debt to total capitalization as of August 31, 2006 was only 29%. Cash and marketable securities were $175 million as of August 31, 2006. Total shareholders' equity was $2.05 billion.
Adoption of FAS Statement No. 123(R)
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company adopted FAS Statement No. 123(R), . This statement requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as an expense in the statement of income based on their fair values. The Company adopted this statement using the modified retrospective method, which included the restatement of prior periods. This adoption lowered earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from $0.47 per diluted share to $0.46 per diluted share.
Share-Based
Payment
Outlook
Mr. Farmer commented, "Based on our sales results through the first quarter, a leveling off of energy costs as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and a less active hurricane season to date, we reiterate our fiscal 2007 guidance which calls for fiscal 2007 revenue of $3.77 to $3.85 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. We expect fiscal 2007 to be another record year at Cintas, which would result in our 38th consecutive year of growth in sales and earnings."
