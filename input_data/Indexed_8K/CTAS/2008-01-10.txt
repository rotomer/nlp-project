Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On January 9, 2008, Cintas Corporation (the "Registrant") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") by and among the Registrant, Cintas Corporation No. 2, a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant ("Cintas No. 2"), the other guarantors (as set forth on Schedule A to Exhibit 5 to this Form 8-K) (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., as Representative of the several underwriters, relating to the issuance and sale of $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Cintas No. 2's 6.125% Senior Notes due 2017 guaranteed (collectively, the "Guarantees") by the Registrant and the Subsidiary Guarantors (together with the Registrant, the "Guarantors").
     The notes to be issued pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement consist of an additional issuance of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2017, $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of which have been previously issued. The notes to be issued pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement will become part of the same series as the outstanding notes for all purposes under the Indenture (as defined below) and together are referred to in this Form 8-K as the "Notes." The notes to be issued pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of May 28, 2002 (the "Indenture"), by and among Cintas No. 2, the Registrant, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and U.S. Bank, National Association (as successor trustee to Wachovia Bank, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-136631) (as amended, the "Registration Statement") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act.
     The net proceeds received by Cintas No. 2, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $50.2 million and will be used to repay a portion of Cintas No. 2's outstanding commercial paper borrowings. As of January 8, 2008, the total amount of commercial paper outstanding approximated $215 million, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.31% and maturities ranging from January 9, 2008 through February 8, 2008.
     The Notes bear interest from December 7, 2007 at a rate equal to 6.125% per year, payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2008. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively.
     The Indenture, among other things, limits Cintas No. 2's ability and the ability of the Registrant and its other subsidiaries, to incur certain liens; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; and in the case of Cintas No. 2, the Registrant and each Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture), merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of their assets.
     If Cintas No. 2 or the Registrant experiences a change of control and the Notes are rated below investment grade by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Cintas No. 2 must offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
     The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes of the affected series if an event of default (except for an event of default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs under the Indenture and has not been cured. An event of default for these purposes generally means (1) the failure to pay the principal on a Note on its due date, (2) the failure to pay interest on a Note within 30 days of its due date, (3)
 
either Cintas No. 2 or a Guarantor remains in breach of any other term of the Indenture for 60 days after its receipt of written notice of such breach or (4) any guarantee in respect of the Notes by the Registrant or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is Significant Subsidiary Guarantor ceases, for any reason, to be in full force and effect. Upon an event of default involving certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the Notes shall become immediately due and payable without any action by the Trustee or the holders.
     Cintas No. 2 has the right to redeem some or all of the Notes at any time, or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes that would be due after the redemption date discounted to the date of redemption, at the applicable Treasury rate plus a make whole spread equal to 35 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as applicable.
     KeyBank National Association, an affiliate of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., acted as the joint lead arranger of, and is the administrative agent and a lender under, the Registrant's revolving credit facility. KeyBank National Association has received, and will continue to receive, customary fees for its services in such capacities.
     This description of the offering and terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement (attached as Exhibit 1), the Indenture (incorporated by reference as set forth below), the form of Officers' Certificate establishing the terms of the Notes and the form of the Notes (each as incorporated by reference as set forth below).

in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus will be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined under the Investment Company Act.
               (xvi) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal or governmental actions, suits, proceedings, inquiries or investigations pending as to which the Company or any of the Guarantors is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of the Guarantors is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of the Guarantors, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company or any of the Guarantors to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.
               (xvii) The statements contained in (A) the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Senior Debt Securities," "Description of Notes," "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" and (B) in Item 15 of the Registration Statement, insofar as such statements purport to summarize legal matters or provisions of the documents referred to therein, present accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters and provisions.
          Such counsel shall state that, although such counsel has not independently verified, is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy or completeness (except as and to the extent set forth in subsection (xvii) above) of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, they have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; from time to time, such counsel has had discussions with officers, directors and employees of the Parent and its subsidiaries, with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, the independent accountants who examined the financial statements of the Parent included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, with representatives of the Underwriters and with counsel to the Underwriters; and, on the basis of the foregoing, such counsel advises you that nothing has come to such counsel's attention which would lead them to believe that (A) the Registration Statement, at the time it first became effective and at any deemed new effective date under Rule 430B(f) under the Securities Act Regulations, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement), (B) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time and at the Delivery Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Disclosure Package) or (C) or that the Prospectus, as of its date and at the Delivery Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Prospectus).
 
          (d) Jones Day, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representative their written opinion, dated the Delivery Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative.
          (e) The Underwriters shall have received, on each of the date hereof and the Delivery Date, a letter dated the date hereof or the Delivery Date, as applicable, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, from Ernst & Young LLP containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information of the Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, provided that the letter shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than the third day prior to such Delivery Date.
          (f) The Parent shall have furnished to the Underwriters a certificate, dated the Delivery Date, executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Parent, to the effect that:
               (i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors in Section 1 of this Agreement are true and correct as of the date given and as of the Delivery Date;
               (ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A under the Securities Act against the Company or any of the Guarantors or related to the offering of the Securities have been initiated or threatened by the Commission;
               (iii) No stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Securities Act;
               (iv) When the Registration Statement became effective and at all times subsequent thereto up to the date hereof, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto contained all material information required to be included therein by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as the case may be, and in all material respects conformed to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as the case may be; the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, did not and do not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and, since the effective date of the Registration Statement, there has occurred no event required to be set forth in an amendment or supplemented Prospectus which has not been so set forth; and
               (v) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus, except as set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors has sustained any loss or
 
interference with its business material to the Company and the Guarantors considered as a whole, and there has not been any (a) transaction or event which has a Material Adverse Effect, (b) change in the capitalization of the Company or any of the Guarantors that is material to the Company and the Guarantors taken as a whole, (c) any obligation, contingent or otherwise, directly or indirectly incurred by the Company or any Guarantors that is material to the Company and the Guarantors taken as a whole or (d) any dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Parent on any class of its capital stock.

          (h) On or after the date hereof, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the debt securities of the Company or any of the Guarantors by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act Regulations, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the debt securities of the Company or any of the Guarantors.

Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company and each of the Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act Regulations, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by an Underwriter expressly for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information described as such in Section 7(b). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, other liability under this Agreement.
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
 
omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by such Underwriter expressly for inclusion therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus: (i) the fifth paragraph, (i) the eighth paragraph and (iii) the last sentence of the ninth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting." This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, other liability under this Agreement.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, except as provided in the following sentence, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of the indemnifying party's election to assume the defense of such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) if the named parties in any such action include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there is an actual or potential conflict between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement thereof, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel in addition to any local counsel). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or
 
claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (x) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
pro rata
     8. . If, on the Delivery Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
 
purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representative with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Delivery Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within forty-eight hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7 and Section 10 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Delivery Date but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Schedule B
          As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 8. Any action taken under this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     9. . The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Underwriters by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Section 6(g), Section 6(h) or Section 6(i) shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase such Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement. In such case, the Company shall have no liability hereunder except as provided by Section 5, Section 7 and Section 10 hereof.
Termination
     10. . If (a) the Company and the Guarantors shall fail to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason under this Agreement other than a breach by the Underwriters of their representations herein or obligations hereunder or (b) the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement (including the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 but excluding the failure of any of the conditions herein to be satisfied as a result of a breach by the Underwriters of their representations herein), the Company and the Guarantors shall reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Securities, and upon demand, the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Underwriters. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantors shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
     11. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:

Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
     13. . The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them.
Survival
     14. . Each of the Company and the Guarantors acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors
