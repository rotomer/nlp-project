If a Director is not elected, the Director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take the matter under advisement and make a recommendation to the full Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors will act on the offer of resignation, taking into account any recommendation of the Committee, and disclose its decision within ninety days from the date of certification of the election results. A Director who tenders his resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors.  If no Director receives a majority of shares cast in an uncontested election, the incumbent Directors will nominate a slate of Directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of election directors within one hundred eighty days after certification of the shareholder vote.  For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a Director must exceed the number of votes cast against or withheld from the authority to vote for that Director.
Voting for Directors
 
 
 
 
Provided, however, that if the number of nominees for Director exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors.

Section 1.
  
Right to Indemnification
 
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or Officer of the Corporation, (whether the basis of a proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a director, officer, or in any other capacity while serving as such a director or officer), or is or was serving with respect to employee benefit plans of the Corporation, or, that being or having been such a Director or Officer or an Employee of the Corporation, he or she is or was serving in an outside position as a director or officer or management committee member of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, (including a non-profit entity) but provided that such service in the outside position has either been authorized by Board Resolution or has been at the specific written request of an Executive Officer of the Corporation, such person (hereinafter an indemnitee) shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including without limitation attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be provided to any such indemnitee if the Corporation is prohibited by the nonexclusive provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act or other applicable law as then in effect from paying such
 
 
 
 
indemnification; and provided, further, that except as provided in Section 2 of this Article with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if a proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Section 1 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition.
 
Any advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 1 and upon delivery to the Corporation of a written affirmation by the indemnitee of his or her good faith belief that such indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation pursuant to this Section or upon such determination as may be permitted or required by the Washington Business Corporation Act or other applicable law.
 
Section 2.
  
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
 
If a claim under Section 1 of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be thirty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.  If successful in whole or in part, in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.  The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Section upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking and affirmation or determination have been tendered to or made by the Corporation) and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is so entitled.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel or the Shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board, independent legal counsel or the Shareholders) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.
 
Section 3.
  
Nonexclusivity of Rights
 
The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Corporation, general or specific action of the Board, contract or otherwise.
 
 
 
 
Section 4.
  
Insurance, Contracts and Funding
 
The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, Officer, Employee or Agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Washington Business Corporation Act.  The Corporation may enter into contracts with any Director, Officer, Employee or Agent of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Section and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Section.
 
Section 5.
  
Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation
 
The Corporation may, by action of the Board, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to Employees and Agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to Directors and Officers of the Corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the Washington Business Corporation Act or otherwise.

Section 4.
  
Transfer of Shares
 
The transfer of shares of the Corporation shall be made only on the stock transfer books of the Corporation pursuant to authorization or document of transfer made by the holder of record thereof or by his or her legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney-in-fact authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation. All certificates surrendered to the Corporation for transfer shall be cancelled and no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificates for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled.
