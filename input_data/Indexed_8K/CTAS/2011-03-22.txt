FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 22, 2011
 
CINCINNATI, March 22, 2011  Cintas Corporation
(Nasdaq:CTAS) today reported its results for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2011.  Revenue for the quarter, which ended February 28, 2011, was $937.8 million, representing an 8.8% increase compared to last year's third quarter.  Net income increased 20.6% to $59.1 million as compared to $49.0 million in last year's third quarter.  Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.41, a 28.1% increase over the $0.32 earnings per diluted share reported in last year's third quarter.
 
Scott D. Farmer, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our revenue momentum of the past several quarters continued throughout our third quarter, propelled largely by improvements in sales productivity and customer retention.  Our organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 5.5%, up sequentially from 4.2% and 2.8% in this year's second and first quarters, respectively."
 
Mr. Farmer added, "We are pleased with our operating margin improvement, both year over year and sequentially.  A year ago, upon seeing signs of stabilization in the U.S. economy, we invested in sales resources to create revenue momentum. This fiscal year's third quarter operating income results reflect the leveraging of this investment."
 
Cintas' balance sheet remains strong as of February 28, 2011.  Cash and marketable securities were $216.7 million.  Cintas' current ratio was 3.4 to 1.  Total debt was $808.1 million and total debt to total capitalization was 25%.
 
Mr. Farmer concluded, "Based on our third quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2011.  We expect our fiscal 2011 revenue to be in the range of $3.75 billion to $3.77 billion.  While not significantly impacting our third quarter earnings, the recent increase in gasoline and diesel costs could negatively impact fourth quarter earnings.  Thus, we expect our fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.63."

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Regulation G Disclosure
 
The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  To supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company provides additional measures of operating results, net earnings, net margin and earnings per share adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses and gains and losses.  The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate to enhance understanding of its past performance as well as prospects for future performance.  A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is shown below.
 
Management believes earnings per diluted share excluding the legal settlement charges provides investors pertinent information given the one-time nature of these charges.
 
 
 
 
Note:
                  
Management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the Company.  Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue, improve and grow business operations.
