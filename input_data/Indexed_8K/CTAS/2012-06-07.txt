Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)           The Company and each of the Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act Regulations, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantors shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by an Underwriter expressly for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information described as such in Section 7(b).  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, other liability under this Agreement.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees
and agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by such Underwriter expressly for inclusion therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished to the Company or any of the Guarantors by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus: (A) the fifth paragraph, (B) the eighth paragraph, and (C) the last sentence of the ninth paragraph, in each case under the caption "Underwriting."  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, other liability under this Agreement.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, except as provided in the following sentence, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of the indemnifying party's election to assume the defense of such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) if the named parties in any such action include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there is an actual or potential conflict between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting
the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement thereof, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel in addition to any local counsel).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (x) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)             If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required
pro rata
to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
 
8.
                                     
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
.  If, on the Delivery Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names on bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date.  If, on the Delivery Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within forty-eight hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Section 5, Section 7 and Section 10 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Delivery Date but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
Schedule B
 
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 8.  Any action taken under this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
9.
                                     
Termination

In such case, the Company shall have no liability hereunder except as provided by Section 5, Section 7 and Section 10 hereof.
 
10.

Section 9 but excluding the failure of any of the conditions herein to be satisfied as a result of a breach by the Underwriters of their representations herein), the Company and the Guarantors shall reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Securities, and upon demand, the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Underwriters.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantors shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.

This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited (subject to exceptions provided in the Indenture) to the aggregate principal amount specified in the Officers' Certificate, dated as of June 8, 2012, establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture; provided that the Company may, without the consent of Holders, reopen this series of Securities and issue additional Notes, so as to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Notes Outstanding upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Indenture so long as any such additional Notes have the same tenor and terms (including, without limitation, rights to receive accrued and unpaid interest as the Notes then Outstanding). The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in the denominations specified in the Officers' Certificate, dated as of June 8, 2012, establishing the terms of the Notes, all as more fully provided in the Indenture and such Officers' Certificate. As provided in the Indenture and in such Officers' Certificate, and subject to certain limitations set
 
 
forth in the Indenture, such Officers' Certificate and in this Note, the Notes of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series in different denominations, as requested by the Holders surrendering the same.
 
The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed as to the due and punctual payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect thereof by the Guarantors as evidenced by their guarantees (the "Guarantees") included in the Indenture and set forth hereon. The Guarantees are direct and unconditional obligations of such Guarantors and rank and will rank equally in priority of payment and in all other respects with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of such Guarantors now or hereafter outstanding.
 
This Note is redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time prior to the date that is three months prior to its Maturity Date, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Note to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points, and in each case accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date.  If this Note is redeemed on or after the date that is three months prior to its Maturity Date, the Note will be redeemed at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of its principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for the Notes, (i) the yield, under the heading that represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication that is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and that establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Maturity Date of the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issuer will be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (ii) if the release referred to in clause (i) (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain the yields referred to above, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or if the Trustee is unable to obtain at least four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations obtained by the Trustee.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (and its successors), or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee and reasonably acceptable to the Company or, if applicable, the Guarantor.

Morgan Securities LLC and its successors, and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Independent Investment Banker (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"); provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for the Notes, an average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue for the Notes (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to the Holder hereof at its address as such address shall appear in the Security Register of the Company. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption.
 
Except as provided above, this Note is not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event (defined below) occurs, unless the Company has otherwise exercised its right to redeem the Notes, it will make an offer (a "Change of Control Repurchase Event Offer") to each Holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000) of that Holder's Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date (the "Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and stating:
 
(1)

(5)

(7)

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.
 
On the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
(1)
