The Company will not assume any liabilities of Verizon other (i) than those associated with contracts, facilities and certain other assets transferred in connection with the purchase and (ii) certain employee-related liabilities, including liabilities for postretirement health benefits.

In addition to the continued provision of traditional local exchange telephone services, the Company intends to provide long distance, Internet access and other advanced technology services in certain of the acquired service areas.

Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing a foreign branch of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, however, that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Note and this Agreement. Loans of more than one interest rate option may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Loan which, if made, would result in an aggregate of more than 10 separate Borrowings being outstanding hereunder at any one time.

(c) Subject to Section 2.3, each Lender shall make its portion of each Borrowing on the proposed Borrowing Date thereof by paying the amount required to the Administrative Agent in New York City in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon, New York time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 2:00 p.m., New York time, credit the amounts so received to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent or, if Loans are not made on such date because any condition precedent to a Borrowing herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders as soon as practicable; provided, however, if and to the extent the Administrative Agent fails to return any such amounts to a Lender on the Borrowing Date for such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall pay interest on such unreturned amounts, for each day from such Borrowing Date to the date such amounts are returned to such Lender, at the Federal Funds Rate. (d) The outstanding principal amount of each Loan which is a Eurodollar Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, as the case may be, and the outstanding principal balance of each Loan which is a Base Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 2.7 Notes.

Each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower to, make in its records relating to such Note an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan of such Lender, and each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing by the Borrower to a Lender and unpaid under the Note of such Lender. The failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of the relevant Note. 2.8 Interest on Loans. ------------------ (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.9, each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (i) the Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan, plus the Applicable Margin.

Interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be payable on each Quarterly Payment Date applicable thereto. The applicable Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.9 Interest on Overdue Amounts. ---------------------------- If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming due hereunder, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by Law, (x) in the case of default in payment of principal, on the outstanding principal amount of all Loans and (y) in the case of default in payment of interest or any other such amount, on such defaulted amount, in each case up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment), at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the applicable Default Rate. 2.10 Alternate Rate of Interest for Eurodollar Loans. ------------------------------------------------ In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that dollar deposits in the amount of the requested principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan are not generally available in the London interbank market, or that dollar deposits are not generally available in the London interbank market for the requested Interest Period, or that the rate at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining such Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give telecopy notice of such determination, stating the specific reasons therefor, to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Loan shall, until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan. Each determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.11 Prepayment of Loans. -------------------- (a) Optional Prepayments. Prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall have the right at any time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part, subject to the requirements of Section 2.14 and Section 2.15 but otherwise without premium or penalty, but prepayment of Eurodollar Loans shall require at least two Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that each such partial prepayment shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000. Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing to be prepaid, and may be revocable; provided that Borrower shall be liable for any costs incurred pursuant to Section 2.14 based upon such revocable notice. (b) Mandatory Prepayments. ---------------------- (i) Commitment Reductions. On the date of any termination or reduction of the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.5(a), the Borrower shall pay or repay so much of the Loans as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding will not exceed the Total Commitment following such termination or reduction. (ii) Asset Sales. No later than the first Business Day following the date of receipt by any Company of Net Cash Proceeds (including, without limitation, any Net Cash Proceeds relating to the Wireless Assets), the Borrower shall apply such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with Section 5.16. (iii) Issuance of Equity Securities. On the date of receipt by the Borrower of any cash proceeds from a capital contribution to, or the issuance of any capital stock of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than pursuant to any employee stock or stock option compensation plan or a contribution to capital by a Company to another Company), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith, including reasonable legal fees and expenses; provided that, to the extent the amount of such net proceeds shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Loans then outstanding, the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by an amount equal to such excess. (iv) Issuance of Debt Securities. On the date of receipt by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any cash proceeds from incurrence of any Debt of the Borrower or any of such Subsidiaries (excluding up to $750,000,000 of Debt incurred pursuant to bank credit facilities to refinance the credit facilities under the Existing Credit Agreements and any loan made by a Company to another Company), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable costs and expenses associated therewith, including reasonable legal fees and expenses; provided that, to the extent the amount of such net proceeds shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Loans then outstanding, the Commitments shall be permanently reduced by an amount equal to such excess. (c) All Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. (d) All prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment. (e) Subject, in the case of Section 2.11(b)(i), to the requirements of Section 2.5, any payment or prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11(b) shall be applied to such Borrowing or Borrowings as the Borrower shall select. All prepayments under Section 2.11(b) shall be subject to Section 2.14 and Section 2.15. 2.12 Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances. ---------------------------------------------- (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement any Regulatory Change (i) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any other fees or amounts payable hereunder (other than (x) Taxes imposed on or measured by the capital, receipts or franchises of such Lender or the overall gross or net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein (or any Tax which is enacted or adopted by such jurisdiction, political subdivision, or taxing authority as a direct substitute for any such Taxes) or (y) any Tax, assessment, or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure of any Lender to comply with any certification, information, documentation, or other reporting requirement), (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, such Lender under this Agreement, or (iii) with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, shall impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of maintaining its Commitment or of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) in respect thereof by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increase or reduction to such Lender, to the extent such amounts have not been included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate, upon demand by such Lender (through the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Lender be permitted to receive any compensation hereunder constituting interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. (b) If any Lender shall have determined in good faith that any Regulatory Change regarding capital adequacy or compliance by any Lender (or its parent or any lending office of such Lender) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any Tribunal, monetary authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's (or its parent's) capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its parent) could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change, or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction upon demand by such Lender (through the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any Lender be permitted to receive any compensation hereunder constituting interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the Regulatory Change or other event giving rise to such costs, (ii) such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and (ii) the calculation of such amount or amounts under clause (a)(i), shall be delivered to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) promptly after such Lender determines it is entitled to compensation under this Section 2.12, and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after its receipt of the same. In preparing such certificate, such Lender may employ such assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in good faith deem reasonable and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution method. (d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any Interest Period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's rights to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to such Interest Period or any other Interest Period. The protection of this Section 2.12 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation, or condition which shall have been imposed. (e) In the event any Lender shall seek compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12, the Borrower may, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, give notice to such Lender (with copies to the Agents) that it wishes to seek one or more Eligible Assignees to assume the Commitment of such Lender and to purchase its outstanding Loans and Notes (if any). Each Lender requesting compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to sell its Commitment, Loans, Notes, and interest in this Agreement and the other Loan Papers to any such Eligible Assignee for an amount equal to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and accrued interest on such Loans and Notes plus all other fees and amounts (including, without limitation, any compensation claimed by such Lender under this Section 2.12 and as to which such Lender has delivered the certificate required by Section 2.12(c) on or before the date such Commitment, Loans, and Notes are purchased) due such Lender hereunder calculated, in each case, to the date such Commitment, Loans, Notes (if any), and interest are purchased, whereupon such Lender shall have no further Commitment or other obligation to the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Paper. (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligations of the Borrower hereunder, the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.12 shall survive for one year after the termination of this Agreement and/or the payment or assignment of any of the Loans or Notes. 2.13 Change in Legality. ------------------- (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if any Regulatory Change shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may: (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon the Borrower shall be prohibited from requesting Eurodollar Loans from such Lender hereunder unless such declaration is subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) if such unlawfulness shall be effective prior to the end of any Interest Period of an outstanding Eurodollar Loan, require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans with such Interest Periods made by it be converted to Base Rate Loans, in which event (A) all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below and (B) all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted Eurodollar Loans shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans resulting from the conversion of such Eurodollar Loans. (b) For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower. 2.14 INDEMNITY. ---------- THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY EACH LENDER AGAINST ANY LOSS OR REASONABLE EXPENSE WHICH SUCH LENDER MAY SUSTAIN OR INCUR AS A CONSEQUENCE OF (A) ANY FAILURE BY THE BORROWER TO FULFILL ON THE DATE OF ANY BORROWING HEREUNDER THE APPLICABLE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4, (B) ANY FAILURE BY THE BORROWER TO BORROW HEREUNDER AFTER A NOTICE OF BORROWING PURSUANT TO SECTION 2 HAS BEEN GIVEN, (C) ANY PAYMENT, PREPAYMENT, OR CONVERSION OF A EURODOLLAR LOAN REQUIRED BY ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE MADE ON A DATE OTHER THAN THE LAST DAY OF THE APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE ACCELERATION OF OUTSTANDING LOANS AS A RESULT OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT, (D) ANY FAILURE BY THE BORROWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE EXISTENCE OF A DEFAULT OR AN EVENT OF DEFAULT) TO PAY, PREPAY OR CONVERT A EURODOLLAR LOAN ON THE DATE FOR SUCH PAYMENT, PREPAYMENT OR CONVERSION, SPECIFIED IN THE RELEVANT NOTICE OF PAYMENT, PREPAYMENT OR CONVERSION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE INDEMNITY OF THE BORROWER PURSUANT TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OR REASONABLE EXPENSE SUSTAINED OR INCURRED OR TO BE SUSTAINED OR INCURRED IN LIQUIDATING OR EMPLOYING DEPOSITS FROM THIRD PARTIES ACQUIRED TO EFFECT OR MAINTAIN SUCH LOAN OR ANY PART THEREOF AS A EURODOLLAR LOAN. SUCH LOSS OR REASONABLE EXPENSE SHALL INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE EXCESS, IF ANY, AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY EACH LENDER OF (I) ITS COST OF OBTAINING THE FUNDS FOR THE LOAN BEING PAID, PREPAID, OR CONVERTED OR NOT BORROWED, PAID, PREPAID OR CONVERTED (BASED ON THE EURODOLLAR RATE APPLICABLE THERETO) FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF SUCH PAYMENT, PREPAYMENT, OR CONVERSION OR FAILURE TO BORROW, PAY, PREPAY OR CONVERT TO THE LAST DAY OF THE INTEREST PERIOD FOR SUCH LOAN (OR, IN THE CASE OF A FAILURE TO BORROW, PAY, PREPAY OR CONVERT, THE INTEREST PERIOD FOR THE LOAN WHICH WOULD HAVE COMMENCED ON THE DATE OF SUCH FAILURE TO BORROW, PAY, PREPAY OR CONVERT) OVER (II) THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST (AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY SUCH LENDER) THAT WOULD BE REALIZED BY SUCH LENDER IN REEMPLOYING THE FUNDS SO PAID, PREPAID, OR CONVERTED OR NOT BORROWED, PAID, PREPAID OR CONVERTED FOR SUCH PERIOD OR INTEREST PERIOD, AS THE CASE MAY BE. A CERTIFICATE OF EACH LENDER SETTING FORTH ANY AMOUNT OR AMOUNTS AND, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, THE COMPUTATIONS THEREOF, WHICH SUCH LENDER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 2.14 SHALL BE DELIVERED TO THE BORROWER (WITH A COPY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT) AND SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE, IF MADE IN GOOD FAITH, ABSENT MANIFEST ERROR. THE BORROWER SHALL PAY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE ACCOUNT OF EACH LENDER THE AMOUNT SHOWN AS DUE ON ANY CERTIFICATE WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER ITS RECEIPT OF THE SAME. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY LENDER BE PERMITTED TO RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION HEREUNDER CONSTITUTING INTEREST IN EXCESS OF THE HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE SURVIVAL OF ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER HEREUNDER, THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER UNDER THIS SECTION 2.14 SHALL SURVIVE FOR ONE YEAR AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PAYMENT OR ASSIGNMENT OF ANY OF THE LOANS OR NOTES. 2.15 Pro Rata Treatment. ------------------- Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, each payment or prepayment of principal and each payment of interest with respect to a Borrowing shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans extended by each Lender, if any, with respect to such Borrowing, and conversions of Loans to Loans of another Type and continuations of Loans that are Eurodollar Loans from one Interest Period, shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. 2.16 Sharing of Setoffs. ------------------- Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim against the Borrower, including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Note held by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12 or Section 2.14) as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Note held by it shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Note held by any other Lender, it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from such other Lender a participation in the Note held by such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Note and participations in Notes held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Notes then outstanding as the principal amount of the Note held by it prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim was to the principal amount of all Notes outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim; provided, however, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Note deemed to have been so purchased may, upon the existence of an Event of Default, exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 2.17 Payments. --------- (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under any instrument delivered hereunder not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the day when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to on Schedule 1 for the account of the Lenders, in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal of or interest on Loans (other than pursuant to Section 2.12 and Section 2.14) or Commitment Fees ratably to the Lenders and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in all such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or Commitment Fee, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of a Eurodollar Loan to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made or will make such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (d) All payments (whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursements, or otherwise) by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future Tax, levy, impost, or any other charge against the Borrower, if any, of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter imposed by any Tribunal excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agents, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or such Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof. If the making of such payments by the Borrower is prohibited by Law unless such a Tax, levy, impost, or other charge is deducted or withheld therefrom, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on the date of each such payment, such additional amounts (without duplication of any other amounts required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the Lenders after such deduction or withholding shall equal the amounts which would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. The Borrower shall confirm that all applicable Taxes, if any, imposed on this Agreement or transactions hereunder shall have been properly and legally paid by it to the appropriate taxing authorities by sending official Tax receipts or notarized copies of such receipts to the Administrative Agent within 30 days after payment of any applicable Tax. (e) So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, payments and prepayments of the Obligation shall be applied first to accrued interest then due and payable and to the remaining Obligation in the order and manner as the Borrower may direct; provided, however, unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any payments and prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.5(a) or Sections 2.11(a) through (d) shall be applied first to accrued interest then due and payable, then to principal of the Loans. At any time during which an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if the Borrower fails to give direction, any payment or prepayment shall be applied in the following order: (i) to expenses and fees for which the Agents and the Lenders have not been reimbursed in accordance with the Loan Papers; (ii) to accrued interest; and (iii) to the remaining Obligation in the order and manner as the Majority Lenders deem appropriate. 2.18 Calculation of Eurodollar Rate. ------------------------------- The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the Eurodollar Rate are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a Eurodollar Loan as it sees fit. All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained funding of each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase in the London interbank market of one or more eurodollar deposits, in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan and having a maturity corresponding to the Interest Period for such Loan. 2.19 Booking Loans. -------------- Any Lender may make, carry, or transfer Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices. 2.20 Quotation of Rates. ------------------- It is hereby acknowledged that the Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which notice of a Borrowing is to be delivered by the Borrower in order to receive an indication of the rate or rates then in effect, but that such projection shall not be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made. SECTION 3 --------- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. ------------------------------ The Borrower represents and warrants to the Agents and the Lenders as follows (it being understood and agreed that the representations and warranties made on the Closing Date are deemed to be made concurrently with the consummation of the part of the Purchase occurring on the Closing Date). 3.1 Purpose of Credit Facility. --------------------------- The Borrower will use Loan proceeds only to finance a portion of the purchase price to be paid in connection with the Purchase and to pay Transaction Costs. The proceeds loaned hereunder will not be used directly or indirectly for the purpose of purchasing or carrying, or for the purpose of extending credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying, any Margin Stock, or to repay any Debt which was created for such purposes. 3.2 Corporate Existence, Good Standing, and Authority. -------------------------------------------------- Each Company is, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of its state of incorporation (such jurisdictions being identified on Exhibit 21 of Borrower's most recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K). Except where failure would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Company (a) is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the nature and extent of its business and properties require the same, and (b) possesses all requisite authority, power, licenses, permits, and franchises to conduct its business as is now being, or is contemplated herein to be, conducted. The Borrower possesses all requisite authority, power, licenses, permits, and franchises to execute, deliver, and comply with the terms of the Loan Papers, all which have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action and, except where failure would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, for which no approval or consent of any Person or Tribunal is required which has not been obtained and no filing or other notification to any Person or Tribunal is required which has not been properly completed. 3.3 Significant Subsidiaries. ------------------------- Exhibit 21 of Borrower's most recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K sets forth, in all material respects, all existing Significant Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of December 31, 2001 and correctly lists, as to each Significant Subsidiary, (a) its name and (b) its jurisdiction of incorporation. The shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary owned by the Borrower as of December 31, 2001 (either directly or indirectly through another Subsidiary) as set forth on Exhibit 21 of Borrower's most recent annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K are the duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable shares of such Significant Subsidiary and are owned by the Borrower free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. Schedule 3.3 hereto correctly sets forth the ownership interests of the Borrower, each Significant Subsidiary as of April 30, 2002, and the entities that will acquire the assets in connection with the Purchase as of the Closing Date both before and after giving effect to the Purchase. 3.4 Financial Statements. --------------------- The Current Financials were prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of the Companies as of, and for the periods ended, the dates thereof. There were no material (to the Companies taken as a whole) liabilities, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, of any Company as of the date of the Current Financials which are not reflected therein. No Company has incurred any material (to the Companies taken as a whole) liability, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, between the date of the most recent audited Current Financials and the date hereof, except in the ordinary course of business, such as in connection with acquisitions and financing activities. Each of the Pro Formas reflects the consummation of the Purchase, the sale of the Wireless Assets and the making of the Loans under this Agreement as if such transactions, with respect to the Pro Forma Balance Sheet, had occurred on December 31, 2001 or, with respect to the Pro Forma Statement of Operations, had occurred on the first day of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. The Pro Formas are consistent in all material respects with the corresponding forecasts delivered to the Lenders prior to the Closing Date. The Projections have been prepared in the light of the past operations of the business of the Companies and represent, as of the Closing Date, the good faith estimate of the Companies and their respective senior management of the course of the business of the Companies (including, without limitation, after giving effect to the Purchase, the sale of the Wireless Assets and the making of the Loans under this Agreement) based on the assumptions stated therein. 3.5 Compliance with Laws, Charter, and Agreements. ---------------------------------------------- No Company is, nor will the execution, delivery, performance, or observance of the Loan Papers cause any Company to be, in violation of any Laws or any Material Agreements to which it is a party, other than such violations which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Significant Subsidiary is, nor will the execution, delivery, performance, or observance of the Loan Papers cause the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary to be, in violation of its bylaws or charter. 3.6 Litigation. ----------- Except as described in the Form 10-Q filed by the Borrower for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2002 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the knowledge of the Borrower, no Company is aware of any "Material" Litigation, and there are no Material outstanding or unpaid judgments against any Company. Material for purpose of this Section 3.6 in relation to Litigation would include any actions or proceedings pending or threatened against any Company before any court or Tribunal seeking damages, net of insurance proceeds to the Company, in excess of $10,000,000 in any case or 1% of Consolidated Net Worth in the aggregate, or which might result in any Material Adverse Effect. 3.7 Taxes. ------ All Tax returns of each Company required to be filed have been filed (or extensions have been granted) except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and all Taxes imposed upon each Company which are due and payable have been paid other than Taxes for which the criteria for Permitted Liens have been satisfied. 3.8 Environmental Matters. ---------------------- No Company's ownership of its assets violates any applicable Environmental Law, other than such violations which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Borrower's knowledge, no investigation or review is pending or threatened by any Tribunal with respect to any alleged violation of any Environmental Law in connection with any Company's assets.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower's failure to pay, if caused solely by a wire transfer malfunction or similar problem outside the Borrower's control, shall not be deemed an Event of Default. 6.2 Covenants. ---------- (a) The failure or refusal of the Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Company) to punctually and properly perform, observe, and comply with any covenant, agreement, or condition contained in Sections 5.3(e)(iii), 5.11, 5.12, 5,14, 5.15, 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.24 and 5.25. (b) The failure or refusal of the Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Company) to punctually and properly perform, observe, and comply with any covenant, agreement, or condition contained in any of the Loan Papers to which such Company is a party, other than covenants to pay the Obligation and the covenants listed in clause (a) preceding, and such failure or refusal continues for 10 days after notice from the Arranger to the Borrower. 6.3 Debtor Relief. -------------- The Companies shall not be Solvent, or any Company (a) fails to pay its Debts generally as they become due, (b) voluntarily seeks, consents to, or acquiesces in the benefit of any Debtor Relief Law, or (c) becomes a party to or is made the subject of any proceeding provided for by any Debtor Relief Law, other than as a creditor or claimant, that could suspend or otherwise adversely affect the Rights of the Agents or the Lenders granted in the Loan Papers (unless, in the event such proceeding is involuntary, the petition instituting same is dismissed within 60 days after its filing). 6.4 Attachment. ----------- The failure of any Company to have discharged within 60 days after commencement any attachment, sequestration, or similar proceeding which, individually or together with all such other proceedings then pending, affects assets of such Company having a value (individually or collectively) of 1 percent of Consolidated Net Worth or more. 6.5 Payment of Judgments. --------------------- Any Company fails to pay any judgments or orders for the payment of money in excess of 1 percent of Consolidated Net Worth (individually or collectively) rendered against it or any of its assets and either (a) any enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any creditor upon any such judgment or order or (b) a stay of enforcement of any such judgment or order, by reason of pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect prior to the time its assets may be lawfully sold to satisfy such judgment. 6.6 Default Under Other Agreements. ------------------------------- A default exists under any Material Agreement to which any Company is a party, the effect of which is to cause, or which permits the holder thereof (or a trustee or representative of such holder) to cause, unpaid consideration of at least 2% of Consolidated Net Worth (individually or in the aggregate) to become due prior to the stated maturity or prior to the regularly scheduled dates of payment. 6.7 Antitrust Proceedings. ---------------------- A petition or complaint is filed before or by any Tribunal (including, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Justice Department, or the Federal Communications Commission) seeking to cause the Borrower or any Subsidiary to divest a significant portion of its assets or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair competition, or similar Laws, and such petition or complaint is not dismissed or discharged within 270 days after the filing thereof. 6.8 Misrepresentation. ------------------ Administrative Agent, Arranger or any Lender discovers that any statement, representation, or warranty in the Loan Papers, any Financial Statement of the Borrower, or any writing ever delivered to Administrative Agent, Arranger or any Lender pursuant to the Loan Papers is false, misleading, or erroneous when made or delivered in any material respect. 6.9 Change in Control. ------------------ A Change of Control shall occur. For the purpose of this Section, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if: (a) a third person, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), but excluding any employee benefit plan or plans of Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of Borrower's outstanding voting securities ordinarily having the right to vote for the election of directors of Borrower; or (b) the individuals who, as of March 31, 2002 constituted the Board of Directors of Borrower (the "Board" generally and as of March 31, 2002 the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Board, or in the case of a merger or consolidation of Borrower, do not constitute or cease to constitute at least two-thirds (2/3) of the board of directors of the surviving company (or in a case where the surviving corporation is controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation or entity do not constitute or cease to constitute at least two-thirds (2/3) of the board of such controlling corporation or do not have or cease to have at least two-thirds (2/3) voting seats on any body comparable to a board of directors of such controlling entity or, if there is no body comparable to a board of directors, at least two-thirds (2/3) voting control of such controlling entity), provided that any person becoming a director (or, in the case of a controlling non-corporate entity, obtaining a position comparable to a director or obtaining a voting interest in such entity) subsequent to March 31, 2002, whose election, or nomination for election, was approved by a vote of the persons comprising at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of this Agreement, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board. 6.10 ERISA. ------ Any one of the following shall have occurred: (a) any "Reportable Event" as such term is defined in ERISA under any Plan, (b) the appointment by an appropriate Tribunal of a trustee to administer any Plan, (c) the termination of any Plan within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, or (d) any material accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of ERISA exists under any Plan, and any of (a), (b), (c) or (d) results in a Material Adverse Effect. 6.11 Validity and Enforceability of Loan Documents. ---------------------------------------------- Any Loan Paper shall, at any time after its execution and delivery and for any reason, cease to be in full force and effect in any material respect or be declared to be null and void or the validity or enforceability thereof be contested by any Company party thereto or any Company shall deny that it has any liability or obligations under any Loan Paper to which it is a party. SECTION 7 --------- RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. -------------------- 7.1 Remedies Upon Event of Default. ------------------------------- (a) Should an Event of Default occur and be continuing under Section 6.3, the commitment of the Lenders to make Loans shall automatically terminate and the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation shall automatically become due and payable without any action of any kind whatsoever. (b) Should any other Event of Default occur and be continuing, subject to any agreement among the Lenders, the Arranger may (and shall upon the request of the Majority Lenders), at its (or the Majority Lenders') election, do any one or more of the following: (i) If the maturity of the Obligation has not already been accelerated under Section 7.1(a), declare the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable, whereupon it shall be due and payable (and notice of such declaration shall promptly be given thereafter by the Arranger to the Borrower); (ii) terminate commitments to make Loans hereunder; (iii) reduce any claim to judgment; (iv) exercise (or request each Lender to exercise) the Rights of offset or banker's Lien against the interest of the Borrower in and to every account and other property of the Borrower which are in the possession of any Lender to the extent of the full amount of the Obligation; and (v) exercise any and all other legal or equitable Rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction as the Arranger shall deem appropriate, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the Right to bring suit or other proceedings before any Tribunal either for specific performance of any covenant or condition contained in any of the Loan Papers or in aid of the exercise of any Right granted to the Lenders in any of the Loan Papers. 7.2 Waivers. -------- The Borrower hereby waives presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, and notice of protest and nonpayment, and agrees that its liability with respect to the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment of the Obligation, by any indulgence, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of the Obligation. 7.3 Performance by Arranger. ------------------------ If any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company is not performed in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers, the Arranger may, at its option (but subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders), perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of such Company. In such event, any amount expended by the Arranger in such performance or attempted performance shall be reasonable, payable by the Borrower to the Arranger on demand, shall become part of the Obligation, and shall bear interest at the applicable Default Rate from the date of such expenditure by the Arranger until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that the Arranger does not assume and shall never have, except by its express written consent, any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company. 7.4 Delegation of Duties and Rights. -------------------------------- The Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders may perform any of their duties or exercise any of their Rights under the Loan Papers by or through the Administrative Agent and/or the Arranger and their, the Administrative Agent's and/or the Arranger's officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, or other representatives. 7.5 Lenders Not in Control. ----------------------- None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Paper shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Agents or the Lenders the Right to exercise control over the assets (including, without limitation, real property), affairs, or management of any Company, the power of the Agents and the Lenders being limited to the Right to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 7. 7.6 Waivers by Lenders. ------------------- The acceptance by the Agents or the Lenders at any time and from time to time of partial payment on the Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of Default then existing. No waiver by the Agents, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders of any Event of Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other then-existing or subsequent Event of Default. No delay or omission by the Agents, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders in exercising any Right under the Loan Papers shall impair such Right or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such Right preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other Right under the Loan Papers or otherwise. 7.7 Cumulative Rights. ------------------ All Rights available to the Agents and the Lenders under the Loan Papers are cumulative of and in addition to all other Rights granted to the Agents and the Lenders at law or in equity, whether or not the Obligation is due and payable and whether or not the Agents or the Lenders have instituted any suit for collection, foreclosure, or other action in connection with the Loan Papers. 7.8 Application of Proceeds. ------------------------ Any and all proceeds ever received by the Agents or the Lenders from the exercise of any Rights pertaining to the Obligation shall be applied to the Obligations in the order and manner set forth in Section 2.17. 7.9 Certain Proceedings. -------------------- The Borrower will promptly execute and deliver or cause the execution and delivery of, all applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other documents and papers the Agents or the Lenders may reasonably request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit, license, or authorization of any other Tribunal or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any Rights under the Loan Papers. Because the Borrower agrees that the Agents' and the Lenders' remedies at Law for failure of the Borrower to comply with the provisions of this paragraph would be inadequate and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, the Borrower agrees that the covenants of this paragraph may be specifically enforced. 7.10 Setoff. ------- If an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower (any such notice being hereby expressly waived by the Borrower), to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any portion of the Obligation owing to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not all of the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall be then due. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights and remedies of each Lender hereunder are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 8 --------- AGREEMENT AMONG LENDERS. ------------------------ 8.1 Agents. ------- (a) SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. is hereby appointed as Administrative Agent hereunder. Goldman Sachs Credit Partners, L.P. is hereby appointed as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner hereunder. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Arranger to act on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent and/or the Arranger by the terms hereto, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the Notes (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent and the Arranger shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall be required to take any action which exposes it to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable Law. (b) Each of the Administrative Agent and the Arranger may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed as the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, under this Agreement and the Notes at any time with cause by all Lenders other than the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable (the "Removing Lenders"). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, from among the Lenders (other than the resigning Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable). If no successor Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 calendar days after the retiring Administrative Agent's or Arranger's giving notice of resignation or the Removing Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, may, on behalf of the Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the Laws of or authorized to do business in the United States of America or any state thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, hereunder and under the Notes by a successor Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, such successor Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, and the retiring Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes. After any retiring Administrative Agent's or Arranger's, as applicable, resignation or removal as the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, hereunder and under the Notes, the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, under this Agreement and the Notes. (c) BankOne and Wachovia Bank, National Association, are hereby appointed to act as Co-Documentation Agents hereunder. The Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any Right, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement in such capacity. (d) If Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, fails to take any action under any Loan Paper after an Event of Default and within a reasonable time after being reasonably requested to do so by any Lender (when such Lender is entitled to make such request under the Loan Papers and after such requesting Lender has obtained the concurrence of such other Lenders as may be required hereunder), the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, shall not suffer or incur any liability as a result of such failure or refusal, but such requesting Lender may request the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, to resign as the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, whereupon the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, shall so resign upon receiving such request. (e) Each of the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, in its capacity as a Lender, shall have the same Rights under the Loan Papers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable; the term "Lender" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent and the Arranger; and any resignation by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger hereunder shall not impair or otherwise affect any Rights which it has or may have in its capacity as an individual Lender. (f) Subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Loan Papers, the Agents may be engaged in, or may hereafter engage in, one or more loan, letter of credit, leasing, or other financing transactions (collectively, the "other financings") not the subject of the Loan Papers, with one or more of the Companies, or may act as trustee on behalf of, or depositary for, or otherwise engage in other business transactions with one or more of the Companies, in each case with no responsibility to account therefor to the Lenders. Without limiting Rights to which the Lenders are specifically entitled under the Loan Papers, no other Lenders shall have, by virtue of their being parties hereto, any interest in (i) any such other financings, (ii) any present or future guaranties by or for the account of any Company which are not contemplated or included in the Loan Papers, (iii) any present or future offset exercised by such Agent in respect of such other financings, or (iv) any present or future property taken as security for any such other financings, even if such property may become security for the obligations of any Company arising under the Loan Papers by reason of a general description of indebtedness related to any such other financings; provided that, if any payments in respect of such guaranties or such property or the proceeds thereof shall be applied to reduce the Obligation, then each Lender shall be entitled to share in such application according to its pro rata part thereof. 8.2 Expenses. --------- Each Lender shall pay its pro rata part of any reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other costs of collection) incurred by the Administrative Agent and/or the Arranger in connection with any of the Loan Papers if the Administrative Agent or Arranger, as applicable, does not receive reimbursement therefor from other sources within 60 days after incurred; provided that each Lender shall be entitled to receive its pro rata part of any reimbursement for such expenses, or part thereof, which the Administrative Agent and/or the Arranger subsequently receives from such other sources. 8.3 Proportionate Absorption of Losses. ----------------------------------- Except as herein provided, nothing in the Loan Papers shall be deemed to give any Lender any advantage over any other Lender insofar as the portion of the Obligation arising under the Loan Papers is concerned, or to relieve any Lender from absorbing its pro rata part of any losses sustained with respect to the Obligation (except to the extent unilateral actions or inactions by any Lender result in any credit, allowance, setoff, defense, or counterclaim solely with respect to all or any part of such Lender's pro rata part of the Obligation). 8.4 Delegation of Duties; Reliance. ------------------------------- Each of the Administrative Agent and the Arranger may exercise any of its duties under the Loan Papers by or through its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or agents (collectively, "Representatives"), and the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and their respective Representatives shall (a) be entitled to rely upon (and shall be protected in relying upon) any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telecopy, telegram or teletype message, statement, order, or other documents or conversation believed by it or them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or made by the proper Person and, with respect to legal matters, upon opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable, (b) be entitled to deem and treat each Lender as the owner and holder of its pro rata part of the Obligation for all purposes until, subject to Section 9.20, written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been given to and received by the Arranger (and, any request, authorization, consent, or approval of any Lender shall be conclusive and binding on each subsequent holder, assignee, or transferee of such Lender's pro rata part of the Obligation or Participant therein), and (c) not be deemed to have notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default unless an officer of the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable has actual knowledge thereof or the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable has been notified thereof by a Lender or the Borrower. 8.5 Limitation of Liability. ------------------------ (a) Neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger nor any of their respective Representatives (as defined in Section 8.4) shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under the Loan Papers in good faith and believed by it or them to be within the discretion or power conferred upon it or them by the Loan Papers or be responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment, except for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (IT BEING THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE PARTIES THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ARRANGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ACTIONS AND OMISSIONS RESULTING FROM THEIR ORDINARY CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE), and neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger nor any of their respective Representatives has a fiduciary relationship with any Lender by virtue of the Loan Papers (provided that nothing herein shall negate the obligation of Administrative Agent or Arranger to account for funds received by it for the account of any Lender). (b) Unless indemnified to its satisfaction against loss, cost, liability, and expense, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall be compelled to do any act under the Loan Papers or to take any action toward the execution or enforcement of the powers thereby created or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Papers. If the Administrative Agent or the Arranger requests instructions from the Lenders or from the Majority Lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action (including, but not limited to, any failure to act) in connection with any Loan Paper, the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable, shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to refrain (without incurring any liability to any Person by so refraining) from such act or action unless and until it has received such instructions. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent or the Arranger or any of their respective Representatives be required to take any action which it or they reasonably determine could incur for it or them criminal or onerous civil liability. (c) Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall be responsible in any manner to any Lender or any Participant for, and each Lender represents and warrants that it has not relied upon the Administrative Agent or the Arranger in respect of, (i) the creditworthiness of the Borrower and the risks involved to such Lender, (ii) the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity, or the due execution of any Loan Paper, (iii) any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report, or statement made therein or furnished thereunder or in connection therewith, or (iv) observation of or compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of any Loan Paper on the part of any Company. Each Lender also acknowledges and agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and their respective Representatives and hold them harmless from and against (but limited to such Lender's pro rata part of) any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses, and reasonable disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, asserted against, or incurred by any of them in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Papers or any action taken or omitted by them under the Loan Papers, except to the extent the same result solely from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or their respective Representatives (it being the express intention of the parties that the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and their respective Representatives shall have no liability for actions and omissions resulting from their ordinary contributory negligence). 8.6 Default. -------- Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Lenders agree to promptly confer in order that the Majority Lenders (or, if required by Section 9.15, all Lenders) may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the Rights of the Lenders; provided that the Arranger shall be entitled (but not obligated) to proceed to take any actions necessary in its reasonable judgment to preserve the Rights of the Arranger and the Lenders hereunder, pending agreement by the Majority Lenders (or, if required by Section 9.15, all Lenders) on the course of action to be taken. 8.7 Limitation of Liability of Lenders. ----------------------------------- No Lender or any Participant shall incur any liability to any other Lender or Participant except for acts or omissions in bad faith, and no Lender or any Participant shall incur any liability to any Company or any other Person for any act or omission of any other Lender or any Participant. 8.8 Relationship of Lenders. ------------------------ Nothing herein shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Agents, the Agents and the Lenders, or the Lenders. 8.9 Foreign Lenders. ---------------- Each Lender that is organized under the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any State thereof (a) represents to the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Borrower that (i) under applicable Laws and treaties no Taxes will be required to be withheld by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or the Borrower with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender in respect of the Obligation and (ii) it has furnished to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower two duly completed copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Lender claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder), and (b) covenants to (i) provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrower a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the obsolescence of any previously delivered form in accordance with applicable U.S. Laws and amendments thereto duly executed and completed by such Lender and (ii) comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. Laws with regard to such withholding tax exemption. 8.10 Benefits of Agreement. ---------------------- Except for requiring the Borrower's consent under Section 8.1(b) and the representations and covenants in Section 8.9 in favor of the Borrower, none of the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to the benefit of any Company or any Person other than the Agents, the Lenders, and the Participants; consequently, neither any Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure of any Agent or any Lender to comply with such provisions. SECTION 9 --------- MISCELLANEOUS. -------------- 9.1 Changes in GAAP. ---------------- All accounting and financial terms used in any of the Loan Papers and the compliance with each covenant contained in the Loan Papers which relates to financial matters shall be determined in accordance with GAAP, except to the extent that a deviation therefrom is expressly stated in such Loan Papers. Should a change in GAAP require a change in any method of accounting or should any voluntary change in the accounting methods be permitted pursuant to Section 5.20, then such change shall not result in an Event of Default if, at the time of such change, such Event of Default had not occurred and was not then continuing, based upon the former methods of accounting used by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, after any such change in accounting methods, the Financial Statements required to be delivered shall either be (a) supplemented with financial information prepared in comparative form, in compliance with the former methods of accounting used prior to such change, as well as with the new method or methods of accounting and, for the purpose of determining whether an Event of Default has occurred, Lenders shall look solely to that portion of such supplemental information that complies with the former methods of accounting, or (b) supplemented with financial information prepared in compliance with such new method or methods of accounting but accompanied by such information, in form and detail satisfactory to Lenders, that will allow Lenders to readily determine the effect of such changes in accounting methods on such Financial Statements, and, for the purpose of determining whether an Event of Default has occurred, Lenders shall look solely to such supplemental information as adjusted to reflect compliance with such former method or methods of accounting. 9.2 Money and Interest. ------------------- Unless stipulated otherwise (a) all references in any of the Loan Papers to "dollars," "money," "payments," or other similar financial or monetary terms are references to currency of the United States of America and (b) all references to interest are to simple and not compound interest. 9.3 Number and Gender of Words. --------------------------- Whenever in any Loan Paper the singular number is used, the same shall include the plural where appropriate, and vice versa; and words of any gender in any Loan Paper shall include each other gender where appropriate. The words "herein," "hereof," and "hereunder," and other words of similar import refer to the relevant Loan Paper as a whole and not to any particular part or subdivision thereof. 9.4 Headings. --------- The headings, captions, and arrangements used in any of the Loan Papers are, unless specified otherwise, for convenience only and shall not be deemed to limit, amplify, or modify the terms of the Loan Papers, nor affect the meaning thereof. 9.5 Exhibits. --------- If any Exhibit, which is to be executed and delivered, contains blanks, the same shall be completed correctly and in accordance with the terms and provisions contained and as contemplated herein prior to, at the time of, or after the execution and delivery thereof. 9.6 Communications. --------------- Unless specifically otherwise provided, whenever any Loan Paper requires or permits any consent, approval, notice, request, or demand from one party to another, such communication must be in writing (which may be by telecopy) to be effective and shall be deemed to have been given on the day actually delivered or, if mailed, on the Business Day it is received by the party to be notified at the address indicated on Schedule 1 (unless changed by notice pursuant hereto). 9.7 Form and Number of Documents. ----------------------------- Each agreement, document, instrument, or other writing to be furnished under any provision of this Agreement must be in form and substance and in such number of counterparts as may be reasonably required by the Arranger and its counsel. 9.8 Exceptions to Covenants. ------------------------ The Borrower shall not take any action or fail to take any action which is permitted as an exception to any of the covenants contained in any of the Loan Papers if such action or omission would result in the breach of any other covenant contained in any of the Loan Papers. 9.9 Survival. --------- All covenants, agreements, undertakings, representations, and warranties made in any of the Loan Papers (a) shall survive all closings under the Loan Papers, (b) except as otherwise indicated, shall not be affected by any investigation made by any party, and (c) unless otherwise provided herein shall terminate upon the later of the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Obligation. 9.10 Governing Law. -------------- The Laws (other than conflict-of-laws provisions thereof) of the State of New York and of the United States of America shall govern the Rights and duties of the parties hereto and the validity, construction, enforcement, and interpretation of the Loan Papers. 9.11 VENUE; SERVICE OF PROCESS; JURY TRIAL. -------------------------------------- EACH PARTY HERETO, IN EACH CASE FOR ITSELF, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY (a) IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE UPON IT IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN PAPERS AND THE OBLIGATION BY SERVICE OF PROCESS AS PROVIDED BY NEW YORK LAW, (b) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN PAPERS AND THE OBLIGATION BROUGHT IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, (c) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY CLAIMS THAT ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, (d) AGREES TO DESIGNATE AND MAINTAIN AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH LITIGATION AND TO DELIVER TO THE AGENT EVIDENCE THEREOF, IF REQUESTED, (e) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH LITIGATION BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, POSTAGE PREPAID, AT ITS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN, (f) IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN PAPERS ON THE OBLIGATION SHALL BE BROUGHT IN ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS, AND (g) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN PAPERS AND THE OBLIGATION. 9.12 Maximum Interest Rate. ---------------------- Regardless of any provision contained in any of the Loan Papers, no Lender shall ever be entitled to contract for, charge, take, reserve, receive, or apply, as interest on the Obligation, or any part thereof, any amount in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and, in the event the Lenders ever contract for, charge, take, reserve, receive, or apply as interest any such excess, it shall be deemed a partial prepayment without penalty of principal and treated hereunder as such and any remaining excess shall be refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the Borrower and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law, (a) treat all Borrowings as but a single extension of credit (and the Lenders and the Borrower agree that such is the case and that provision herein for multiple Borrowings and multiple Notes is for convenience only), (b) characterize any nonprincipal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (c) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d) "spread" the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligation; provided that, if the Obligation is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the Lenders shall refund such excess, and, in such event, the Lenders shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving, or receiving interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. 9.13 Invalid Provisions. ------------------- If any provision in any Loan Paper is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable; the appropriate Loan Paper shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had never comprised a part thereof; and the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such provision or by its severance therefrom. Furthermore, in lieu of such provision there shall be added automatically as a part of such Loan Paper a provision as similar thereto as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. 9.14 Entire Agreement. ----------------- THIS AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED IN WRITING FROM TIME TO TIME) AND THE OTHER WRITTEN LOAN PAPERS EXECUTED BY THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS, AND THE LENDERS (OR BY THE BORROWER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE AGENTS OR ANY LENDER) REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BY THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. 9.15 Amendments, Etc. ---------------- No amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Paper nor consent to any departure therefrom by the Borrower shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and then such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all Lenders, do any of the following: (a) increase the Commitment, or extend the Commitment Period or the due date for payment of any of the Obligation, (b) reduce the principal amount of Loans due hereunder or any interest rate or the amount of fees applicable to the Obligation (except such reductions as are contemplated by this Agreement), (c) amend or waive compliance with this Section 9.15 or (d) amend the definition of Majority Lenders; provided that no amendment, waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, as applicable, under this or any other Loan Paper. 9.16 Waivers. -------- No course of dealing nor any failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any Lender, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, or attorneys with respect to exercising any Right of the Lenders hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. A waiver must be in writing and signed by the Lenders (or the Majority Lenders to the extent permitted hereunder) to be effective, and such waiver will be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given. 9.17 Taxes. ------ Any Taxes (excluding income, gross receipts and franchise taxes) payable or ruled payable by any Tribunal in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Paper shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any. 9.18 Governmental Regulation. ------------------------ Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Lenders shall not be obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any Law. 9.19 Multiple Counterparts. ---------------------- This Agreement may be executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes and all of which constitute, collectively, one Agreement; but, in making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. It is not necessary that each Lender execute the same counterpart so long as identical counterparts are executed by the Borrower and each Lender. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts hereof shall have been executed and delivered to the Arranger by each Lender, the Agents, and the Borrower, or, in the case only of the Lenders, when the Arranger shall have received telecopied or other evidence satisfactory to it that each Lender has executed and is delivering to the Arranger a counterpart hereof. 9.20 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Assignments. ---------------------------------------------------- (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower may not, directly or indirectly, assign or transfer, or attempt to assign or transfer, any of its Rights, duties, or obligations under any Loan Papers to which it is a party without the express written consent of all Lenders, and (ii) except as permitted under this Section 9.20, no Lender may transfer, pledge, assign, sell participations in, or otherwise encumber its portion of the Obligation. (b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.20, any Lender may sell to one or more Persons (each a "Participant") participating interests (in each case not less than $5,000,000) in its portion of the Obligation; provided that the Arranger and the Borrower shall have the right to approve any Participant which is not a financial institution. In the event of any such sale to a Participant, (i) such Lender shall remain a "Lender" under this Agreement and the Participant shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder, (ii) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (iii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, (iv) such Lender shall remain the holder of its share of the Obligation for all purposes under this Agreement, and (v) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Arranger shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers. Participants shall have no Rights under the Loan Papers, other than certain voting rights as provided below. Each Lender shall be entitled to obtain (on behalf of its Participants) the benefits of Section 2 with respect to all participations in its Loans outstanding from time to time. No Lender shall sell any participating interest under which the Participant shall have any Rights to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any Loan Paper, except to the extent such amendment, modification, or waiver extends the due date for payment of any amount in respect of principal, interest, or fees due under the Loan Papers, or reduces the interest rate or the amount of principal or fees applicable to the Obligation (except such reductions as are contemplated by this Agreement); provided that in those cases where a Participant is entitled to the benefits of Section 2 or a Lender grants Rights to its Participants to approve amendments to or waivers of the Loan Papers respecting the matters previously described in this sentence, such Lender must include a voting mechanism in the relevant participation agreement whereby a majority of such Lender's portion of the Obligation (whether held by such Lender or participated) shall control the vote for all of such Lender's portion of the Obligation. Except in the case of the sale of a participating interest to a Lender, the relevant participation agreement shall not permit the Participant to transfer, pledge, assign, sell participations in, or otherwise encumber its portion of the Obligation. (c) Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.20, any Lender may sell to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a "Purchaser") a proportionate part (in each case except for any such sale to another Lender or an Affiliate of any Lender, not less than $5,000,000 unless otherwise agreed by both the Arranger and the Borrower) of its Rights and obligations under the Loan Papers pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance (herein so called) between such Purchaser and such Lender in the form of Exhibit E hereto. Upon delivery of an executed copy of the Assignment and Acceptance to the Borrower and the Arranger, from and after the assignment's effective date (which shall be after the date of such delivery), such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender hereunder and shall have all the Rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto with commitments as set forth in the Assignment and Acceptance, and the transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, but shall retain such rights to expense reimbursement and indemnification to which it was entitled at the effective date. Upon any transfer pursuant to this Section 9.20(c), Schedule 1 shall automatically be deemed to reflect the name, address, and Commitment of such Purchaser and the Arranger shall deliver to the Borrower and the Lenders an amended Schedule 1 reflecting such changes. A Purchaser shall be subject to all the provisions in this Section 9.20 the same as if it were a Lender as of the date hereof. (d) If pursuant to Section 9.20(c) any interest in the Obligation is transferred to any Purchaser which is organized under the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Purchaser, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor Lender (for the benefit of the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower) that under applicable Laws and treaties no Taxes will be required to be withheld by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, or the transferor Lender with respect to any payments to be made to such Purchaser in respect of the Obligation, (ii) to furnish to each of the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower two duly completed copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Purchaser claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder), and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower) to provide the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower a new Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the obsolescence of any previously delivered form in accordance with applicable U.S. Laws and amendments thereto duly executed and completed by such Purchaser, and to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. Laws with regard to such withholding tax exemption. (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank. 9.21 Confidentiality. ---------------- All nonpublic information furnished by the Companies to the Agents or the Lenders in connection with the Loan Papers and the transactions contemplated thereby will be treated as confidential, but nothing herein contained shall limit or impair any Agent's or any Lender's right, and each Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled, (a) to disclose the same to any Tribunal or as otherwise required by Law or to any prospective or actual Participant or Purchaser or to the respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, and agents of any prospective or actual Participant or Purchaser (provided that such prospective or actual Participant or Purchaser has agreed in writing to comply with this Section 9.21 and provided further that the Borrower has given its prior written consent to such distribution), (b) to use such information to the extent pertinent to an evaluation of the Obligation, (c) to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of the Loan Papers, and (d) to take any action which such Agent or any Lender deems necessary to protect its interests if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 9.22 Conflicts and Ambiguities. -------------------------- Any conflict or ambiguity between the terms and provisions herein and terms and provisions in any other Loan Paper shall be controlled by the terms and provisions herein. 9.23 General Indemnification. ------------------------ THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY, PROTECT, AND HOLD THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, AND ATTORNEYS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, SUITS, CLAIMS, COSTS, EXPENSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND LEGAL EXPENSES WHETHER OR NOT SUIT IS BROUGHT AND SETTLEMENT COSTS), AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR ASSERTED AGAINST THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE LOAN PAPERS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN (COLLECTIVELY, THE "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES RESULTS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM ANY CLAIM MADE OR ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED BY OR ON BEHALF OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INDEMNIFIED FROM ITS OWN ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE, NO INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER FOR ANY INDEMNIFIED LIABILITY FOUND BY A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT OF A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED FROM ITS OWN FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. THE PROVISIONS OF AND UNDERTAKINGS AND INDEMNIFICATION SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL SURVIVE THE SATISFACTION AND PAYMENT OF THE OBLIGATION AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME SET FORTH IN ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. 9.24 Investment Representation. -------------------------- The Notes are being acquired by the Lenders for their own respective account for investment and not with the view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. The Lenders understand that the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any securities act of any state pursuant to an exemption from the registration provisions thereof. Each Lender shall indemnify the Borrower against and hold it harmless from any claim, and any cost or expense therefrom, that the Borrower shall have committed a violation of applicable Law by virtue of the exercise by such Lender of its right to sell participations or make assignments hereunder.
