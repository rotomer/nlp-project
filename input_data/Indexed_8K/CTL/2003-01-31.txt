(2) Includes corporate overheads previously allocated to discontinued operations. (3) As adjusted to reflect the after-tax effect of eliminating goodwill amortization in accordance with SFAS 142. "The fourth quarter results include a full quarter's impact of the Alabama and Missouri properties acquired from Verizon during the third quarter," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "These markets are making strong contributions to revenue and operating cash flow and we are pleased with our early success in offering CenturyTel's bundled services in these markets." Consolidated revenues from continuing operations for the fourth quarter rose 34.8% to $585.9 million from $434.7 million. EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, grew to $306.2 million from $219.5 million, representing a consolidated EBITDA margin of 52.3% during the quarter. Income from continuing operations for the quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 67.2% to $84.0 million from $50.2 million (as adjusted) in fourth quarter 2001. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 68.6% to $.59 from $.35 (as adjusted). Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 13.5% to $.59 from $.52 (as adjusted). Telephone revenues grew 33.6% to $519.4 million during the quarter, compared with $388.9 million in fourth quarter 2001. Increases in telephone revenues and telephone operating expenses were primarily due to the Verizon acquisitions. In our legacy markets, growth in vertical services and interstate revenues were offset by declines in intrastate access and toll revenues. Telephone operating income increased 35.8% to $176.8 million from $130.2 million (as adjusted), and telephone EBITDA rose 33.3% to $289.8 million from $217.4 million a year ago. CenturyTel's fourth quarter telephone EBITDA margin was 55.8% while the operating income margin was 34.0%. Other Operations revenues grew 45.0% to $66.5 million during fourth quarter 2002, compared with $45.8 million in fourth quarter 2001. CenturyTel's long distance revenues increased $10.5 million, or 34.7%, to $40.7 million. CenturyTel now serves 648,800 long distance customers. Internet revenues increased 44.1% to $16.4 million in fourth quarter 2002 from $11.4 million in fourth quarter 2001. The Internet business generated operating cash flow of $800,000 for the quarter compared to negative operating cash flow of $1.4 million for the fourth quarter 2001. CenturyTel CLEC revenues increased $4.2 million, principally as a result of the acquisition of CLEC operations in February 2002. "The deployment of long distance service to our newly acquired customers in Alabama and Missouri has been very successful as reflected in our 15.9% long distance penetration rate for those properties in less than six months," Post said. "Across all our markets, we added almost 64,000 long distance customers during the quarter, a record number for CenturyTel." For fourth quarter 2002, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company reported net income of $44.3 million, or $.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $63.8 million (as adjusted), or $.45 per diluted share in fourth quarter 2001. Fourth quarter 2002 reflects a $39.0 million after-tax charge associated with the redemption on October 15, 2002, of the Company's $400 million Series I remarketable senior notes. See the accompanying financial information for additional nonrecurring items that affected the periods ending December 31, 2002 and 2001. For the full year 2002, income from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 40.7% to $244.9 million from $174.1 million in 2001 (as adjusted) and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 40.2% to $1.71 from $1.22 (as adjusted). Consolidated revenues from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 17.9% to $1.980 billion from $1.680 billion while EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, was $1.012 billion compared to $840.4 million a year ago, a 20.4% increase. Diluted earnings per share, excluding non-recurring items, was $2.27 for 2002 compared to $1.98 for 2001 (as adjusted). Included in the $2.27 for 2002 is a contribution of approximately $.08 related to the discontinuation of wireless depreciation due to the accounting treatment of the Company's wireless business as discontinued operations effective March 19, 2002. For the year 2002, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $801.6 million, or $5.61 per diluted share, compared to net income of $399.3 million, or $2.81 per diluted share for the year 2001 (as adjusted). Guidance for 2003. Giving effect to a full year's operations of the Verizon properties, anticipated increases in pension expense and pre- and post-retirement medical costs, and anticipated amortization expense and operating costs as we convert to our new billing and customer care system, CenturyTel expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 for the full year 2003. This compares to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (which excludes our discontinued wireless operations) for the full year 2002 of $1.71 per share. For first quarter 2003, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $568 million to $583 million, operating cash flow of $285 million to $295 million, and diluted earnings per share of $.49 to $.53. All these figures exclude nonrecurring items.
