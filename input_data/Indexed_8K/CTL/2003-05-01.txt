CenturyTel, Inc.(NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for first quarter 2003. o Revenues from continuing operations increased 37.3% from first quarter 2002 to $580.5 million, reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). o Earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), excluding nonrecurring items, rose to $297.8 million, an increase of 41.0%. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, grew 11.0% to $80.7 million. Reported under GAAP, net income grew 18.6% to $83.9 million. o Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 9.8% to $.56, while GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 16.0% to $.58. o Free cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, climbed to $139.0 million from $98.2 million. (1) These results include adjustments for nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. (2) Reflects the acquisition of access lines in third quarter 2002 that generated approximately $126 million of telephone revenues during first quarter 2003. (3) Includes corporate overheads previously allocated to discontinued operations. "The execution of our pure-play wireline strategy continues to produce solid results as reflected in the 11% growth in net income, excluding nonrecurring items, over the first quarter of 2002," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "These results affirm the steady demand for communications services and growth opportunities that exist in our rural and small-to-mid-size market areas." Consolidated revenues from continuing operations rose 37.3% to $580.5 million from $422.9 million. EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, grew 41.0% to $297.8 million from $211.3 million. CenturyTel achieved a consolidated EBITDA margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 51.3% during the quarter versus 50.0% in first quarter 2002. Net income from continuing operations for the quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 79.1% to $80.7 million from $45.1 million in first quarter 2002, primarily due to contributions from the properties acquired from Verizon in third quarter 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 75.0% to $.56 from $.32. Telephone revenues for first quarter reached $511.4 million, a 37.2% increase over the $372.7 million in first quarter 2002. Increases in telephone revenues and telephone operating expenses were primarily due to the Verizon acquisitions in third quarter 2002. In our legacy markets, growth in vertical services and interstate revenues more than offset declines in intrastate access and toll revenues. Telephone operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 41.9% to $167.4 million from $118.0 million, and telephone EBITDA, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 35.4% to $280.7 million from $207.3 million a year ago. CenturyTel's first quarter telephone EBITDA margin, excluding nonrecurring items, was 54.9% while the operating income margin, excluding nonrecurring items, was 32.7%. Other operations revenues grew 37.8% to $69.2 million during first quarter 2003, compared with $50.2 million in first quarter 2002. CenturyTel's long distance revenues increased 33.8% to $42.6 million. CenturyTel now serves more than 689,000 long distance customers and more than 60,000 DSL customers, adding more than 40,700 and more than 7,700 customers, respectively, during the quarter. Internet revenues increased 43.5% to $18.0 million in first quarter 2003 from $12.6 million in first quarter 2002. Internet operating income was $353,000 for the quarter compared to $1.4 million in operating losses for the first quarter 2002. CenturyTel CLEC revenues were $4.5 million, an increase of 127.2% over first quarter 2002, primarily due to the acquisition of CLEC operations in February 2002. "Continued solid growth in long distance customers, record DSL customer additions and continued growth in enhanced calling features penetration this quarter reflect good customer response to our advanced product and service offerings," Post said. For first quarter 2003, CenturyTel reported, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidated revenues of $580.5 million, a 37.3% increase from $422.9 million in first quarter 2002. The Company reported an 18.6% increase in net income to $83.9 million and a 16.0% increase in diluted earnings per share reaching $.58, compared to $70.8 million and $.50 per diluted share, respectively, in first quarter 2002. Net income in first quarter 2003 includes a nonrecurring $5.0 million pre-tax favorable adjustment related to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off in connection with the WorldCom bankruptcy. Net income in first quarter 2002 includes a nonrecurring $3.0 million pre-tax unfavorable charge related to advisory and consulting fees. For the second quarter 2003, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $575 to $590 million and diluted earnings per share of $.51 to $.56. For the full year 2003, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.22. This increase in full year 2003 EPS guidance is driven by higher revenues, successful cost and resource management and lower depreciation expense in acquired properties than previously anticipated. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding non-recurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to EBITDA, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com.
