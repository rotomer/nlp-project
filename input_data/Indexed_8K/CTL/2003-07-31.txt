A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. (2) Reflects the acquisition of access lines in third quarter 2002 that generated approximately $127.7 million of telephone revenues during second quarter 2003. (3) Includes corporate overheads previously allocated to discontinued operations. ---------------------- "CenturyTel's results for the second quarter reflect continuing demand for communications services in rural markets and smaller cities where CenturyTel offers bundled services including local, local distance and broadband," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Our 29.2% increase in revenues from Other Operations primarily reflects the continued strong growth in our long distance and Internet operations." Consolidated revenues from continuing operations for the second quarter rose 34.5% to $590.1 million from $438.7 million. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, grew to $305.2 million from $218.5 million, a 39.7% increase. The Company achieved a consolidated cash flow margin of 51.7% for the quarter. Income from continuing operations for the quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 79.0% to $87.4 million from $48.8 million in second quarter 2002, primarily due to contributions from the properties acquired from Verizon in third quarter 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 76.5% to $.60 from $.34. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, were $.60 in both second quarter 2003 and 2002. The wireless business sold by the Company in August 2002 contributed $.26 to second quarter 2002 earnings per share, including $.05 related to discontinuation of depreciation on the assets held for sale. Telephone revenues for second quarter reached $515.0 million, a 35.3% increase over $380.5 million in second quarter 2002. Increases in telephone revenues and telephone operating expenses were primarily due to the Verizon acquisitions in third quarter 2002. In our legacy markets, growth in vertical services and increased revenue from rate increases more than offset declines in access and toll revenues. Telephone operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 46.2% to $173.6 million from $118.7 million, and telephone operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 36.9% to $285.9 million from $208.9 million a year ago. CenturyTel's second quarter 2003 telephone cash flow margin was 55.5% while the operating income margin was 33.7%. Other operations revenues grew 29.2% to $75.2 million during second quarter 2003, compared with $58.2 million in second quarter 2002. CenturyTel's long distance revenues increased 25.4% to $43.2 million. CenturyTel now serves more than 720,000 long distance customers and nearly 68,000 DSL customers, adding more than 30,800 and 7,300 customers, respectively, during the quarter. Internet revenues increased 35.0% to $19.9 million in second quarter 2003 from $14.7 million in second quarter 2002. CenturyTel CLEC revenues were $5.1 million for second quarter 2003. "Through the first half of 2003, we generated free cash flow of nearly $250 million. Our strong cash flow and solid balance sheet provide us the flexibility to respond to opportunities and challenges as they arise," Post said. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company reported a 10.9% increase in net income to $87.4 million and a 9.1% increase in diluted earnings per share reaching $.60 for second quarter 2003, compared to $78.8 million and $.55 per diluted share, respectively, in second quarter 2002. Net income in second quarter 2002 included a nonrecurring $15 million pre-tax ($9.8 million after-tax) charge related to a reserve for uncollectible revenues primarily from WorldCom and a nonrecurring $2.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of a PCS license. For the first six months of 2003, revenues from continuing operations increased to $1.171 billion from $861.6 million for the same period in 2002, a 35.9% increase. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, was $603.0 million for the first half of 2003 compared to $429.8 million a year ago, a 40.3% increase. Income from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 79.0% to $168.1 million from $93.9 million in 2002. For the third quarter 2003, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $590 to $605 million and diluted earnings per share of $.55 to $.60. For the full year 2003, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.34, increased from our previous guidance of $2.14 to $2.22. The increase in 2003 earnings per share guidance is driven by the financial results for second quarter exceeding our expectations, the anticipated impact of stronger telephone revenues and lower total expenses than originally forecast for second half 2003, and the contribution from LightCore, which operates the fiber assets acquired from Digital Teleport, Inc. in June 2003. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com.

Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly-acquired businesses into the Company's operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff, and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the effects of greater than anticipated competition in the Company's markets; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Company's ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in general market or economic conditions or in legislation, regulation or public policy.
