A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. For 2002, these results reflect only one month of operations of the Company's Missouri telephone properties acquired from Verizon on August 31, 2002. (2) Includes corporate overheads previously allocated to discontinued operations. *********** "CenturyTel again achieved solid results that reflect our focus on bringing quality communications services to customers in rural areas and smaller cities while driving revenue and controlling costs," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "We are pleased with our ability to sustain revenue and earnings growth in the currently challenging industry and economic environment." Consolidated revenues from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, for the third quarter rose 13.5% to $603.8 million from $532.1 million, primarily due to contributions from the Missouri properties acquired from Verizon on August 31, 2002. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, grew to $307.6 million from $272.9 million, a 12.7% increase. The Company achieved a consolidated cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 51.0% for the quarter versus 51.3% in third quarter 2002. Income from continuing operations for the quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 27.2% to $88.5 million from $69.6 million in third quarter 2002. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 24.5% to $.61 from $.49. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, were $.61 in third quarter 2003 compared to $.57 in third quarter 2002. Telephone revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, for third quarter reached $521.4 million, an 11.3% increase over $468.6 million in third quarter 2002. The Verizon Missouri properties acquired August 31, 2002, contributed $44.5 million of the increase. The remaining increase resulted primarily from growth in vertical services and access revenues that more than offset revenue declines due to access line losses. Telephone operating expenses increased primarily due to the Verizon Missouri acquisition. Telephone operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 13.4% to $172.6 million from $152.3 million, and telephone operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 10.8% to $284.3 million from $256.6 million a year ago. CenturyTel's third quarter 2003 telephone cash flow margin was 54.5% while the operating income margin was 33.1%. Other operations revenues grew 29.5% to $82.3 million during third quarter 2003, compared with $63.6 million in third quarter 2002. CenturyTel's long distance revenues increased 14.2% to $45.2 million. Internet revenues increased 36.5% to $20.5 million in third quarter 2003 from $15.0 million in third quarter 2002. CenturyTel now serves more than 745,200 long distance customers and 76,300 DSL customers, adding more than 24,800 and 8,300 customers, respectively, during the quarter. Fiber transport revenues increased $6.9 million, primarily due to the June 2003 acquisition of fiber assets from Digital Teleport, Inc. "People in rural areas want and need advanced communications services similar to those in urban areas. In our markets, we are working to position CenturyTel as the carrier of choice for broadband and other services, which is reflected in CenturyTel's record DSL additions of more than 8,300 customers during the third quarter," Post said. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's net income was $91.0 million compared to $607.7 million in 2002, while diluted earnings per share was $.63 for third quarter 2003 compared to $4.26 in third quarter 2002. Net income in third quarter 2003 included a net nonrecurring $2.5 million benefit from out of period income tax adjustments. Net income in third quarter 2002 included a $551.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of its wireless operations. See the accompanying financial information for additional nonrecurring items that affected the third quarters and first nine months of 2003 and 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, results from continuing operations benefited from the Alabama and Missouri wireline properties acquired from Verizon in third quarter 2002. Revenues from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $1.774 billion from $1.394 billion for the same period in 2002, a 27.3% increase. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, was $910.6 million for the first nine months of 2003 compared to $702.7 million a year ago, a 29.6% increase. Income from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 56.9% to $256.5 million from $163.4 million in 2002. For the fourth quarter 2003, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $600 to $615 million and diluted earnings per share of $.58 to $.62. For the full year 2003, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.36 to $2.40, increased from our previous guidance of $2.28 to $2.34. The increase in 2003 earnings per share guidance is driven by our third quarter results exceeding our expectations. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and to identify historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial schedules. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition to historical information, this release includes certain forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly-acquired businesses into the Company's operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff, and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the effects of greater than anticipated competition in the Company's markets; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Company's ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in general market or economic conditions or in legislation, regulation or public policy.
