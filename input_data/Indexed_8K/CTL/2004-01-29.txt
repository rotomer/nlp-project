CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2003. o Revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.2% to $604.8 million from $585.9 million, while GAAP revenues increased 3.5% to $606.3 million from $585.9 million. o Operating cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, rose 0.8% to $311.4 million. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, grew 4.9% to $89.3 million. Reported under GAAP, net income was $82.4 million. o Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.4% to $.61, while GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.57 in fourth quarter 2003. o Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, was $86.8 million in fourth quarter 2003. (1) These results include adjustments for nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. "During 2003, CenturyTel achieved revenue and earnings growth in a very challenging industry environment," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Record cash flows generated in 2003 provided the financial liquidity for CenturyTel to reduce debt by more than $467 million and strengthen our cash position by nearly $200 million." Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 3.2% to $604.8 million from $585.9 million. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, grew to $311.4 million from $308.9 million. The Company achieved a consolidated cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 51.5% for fourth quarter 2003. Net income for the quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 4.9% to $89.3 million from $85.1 million in fourth quarter 2002. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.4% to $.61 from $.59. Telephone revenues for the fourth quarter, excluding nonrecurring items, reached $522.7 million compared to $519.4 million in fourth quarter 2002. Growth in enhanced calling features and intrastate access revenues was partially offset by declines in intrastate toll usage and access lines. Telephone operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $175.5 million while telephone operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $289.1 million. Excluding nonrecurring items, CenturyTel's fourth quarter 2003 telephone operating cash flow margin was 55.3% while the operating income margin was 33.6%. Other operations revenues grew 23.6% to $82.1 million during fourth quarter 2003, compared with $66.5 million in fourth quarter 2002. CenturyTel's long distance revenues increased 5.5% to $42.9 million. Internet revenues increased 31.6% to $21.6 million in fourth quarter 2003 from $16.4 million in fourth quarter 2002. CenturyTel now serves nearly 770,000 long distance customers and more than 83,000 DSL customers, adding more than 24,500 and 7,100 customers, respectively, during the quarter. Fiber transport revenues increased $7.4 million, primarily due to the June 2003 acquisition of fiber assets from Digital Teleport, Inc. For the year 2003, results from continuing operations benefited from the Alabama and Missouri wireline properties acquired from Verizon in third quarter 2002. Revenues from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $2.379 billion from $1.980 billion for the same period in 2002, a 20.2% increase. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.222 billion for 2003 compared to $1.012 billion a year ago, a 20.8% increase. Income from continuing operations, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 39.1% to $345.8 million from $248.5 million in 2002. "Customer demand for long distance and Internet services continued to drive solid revenue growth of nearly $49 million in 2003 as long distance customers grew nearly 19% and DSL customers grew more than 58%. We believe the development of our integrated bundle during 2004 will stimulate further demand for services," Post said. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's fourth quarter 2003 net income was $82.4 million compared to $44.3 million in 2002, while diluted earnings per share was $.57 for fourth quarter 2003 compared to $.31 in fourth quarter 2002. Net income in fourth quarter 2003 reflects an $8.8 million after-tax charge associated with various operating tax audits and an after-tax benefit of $2.0 million related to professional fees previously accrued. Net income in fourth quarter 2002 included a $39.0 million after-tax charge associated with the redemption of $400 million Series I remarketable senior notes. See the accompanying financial information for additional nonrecurring items that affected the fourth quarters and full years of 2003 and 2002. For the year 2003, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $344.7 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $801.6 million, or $5.61 per diluted share for the year 2002. The 2002 results included a $551.4 million after-tax gain, or $3.86 per diluted share, from the sale of the Company's wireless operations in third quarter 2002. Guidance for 2004. CenturyTel anticipates a decline in 2004 telephone revenues primarily due to lower intrastate toll usage, lower cost study adjustments, lower universal service funding and access line declines. Giving effect to these revenue declines, the incremental amortization expense, conversion and operating costs related to the new billing and customer care system, and an expected increase in the Company's effective income tax rate to 38.5% primarily due to state income taxes, CenturyTel expects full year 2004 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20. For first quarter 2004, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $585 to $600 million and diluted earnings per share of $.49 to $.53. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial schedules. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly-acquired businesses into the Company's operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff, and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Company's ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; other risks referenced from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy.
