CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for first quarter 2004. o Operating revenues increased 2.7% to $593.7 million from $578.0 million. o Operating cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, rose to $310.5 million. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, grew 3.2% to $83.3 million. Reported under GAAP, net income was $83.3 million compared to $83.9 million in first quarter 2003. o Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.6% to $.58 from $.56 in first quarter 2003. Reported under GAAP, diluted earnings per share for both first quarter 2004 and first quarter 2003 were $.58. o Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules) was $148.5 million in first quarter 2004. o During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 4,942,000 shares of common stock under its share repurchase program. (1) These results include adjustments for nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. (2) Effective first quarter 2004, long distance units are reported on a line basis instead of a customer basis. First quarter 2003 has been restated on a line basis to ensure period-to-period comparability. * * * * * * * * "CenturyTel achieved both revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter while continuing to generate strong free cash flow," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "We also made excellent progress with our share repurchase program announced in February, investing over $139 million to acquire more than 4.9 million shares of common stock." As previously announced, CenturyTel is presenting its results of operations in a single segment format beginning first quarter 2004. The Company is also reporting separate revenue components that align with its major products and services. However, CenturyTel is providing operating cash flow and operating income information on a consolidated basis only. Quarterly and full year 2003 financial results have been restated to conform to the single segment format and are included in the attached schedules. Operating revenues rose 2.7% to $593.7 million in first quarter 2004 from $578.0 million in first quarter 2003. This $15.7 million revenue increase was driven primarily by the fiber assets acquired during 2003, data revenue growth from DSL subscriber and data circuit additions and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset revenue declines attributable to lower intrastate toll revenues and universal service funding, along with access line losses. Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.0% to $410.1 million, or $11.9 million over first quarter 2003. Cost of services and products increased $3.7 million primarily due to the fiber assets acquired during 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, increased $8.0 million primarily due to the 2003 fiber asset acquisitions, increases in employee costs and increased marketing expenses. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 1.3% to $310.5 million from $306.6 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 52.3% during the quarter versus 53.0% in first quarter 2003. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.2% to $83.3 million from $80.7 million in first quarter 2003 due to a $3.7 million increase in operating income and lower interest expense, which were partially offset by the previously announced increase in state income taxes. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.6% to $.58 from $.56. "The launch of tiered DSL service during the first quarter across CenturyTel's more than 1.5 million DSL-enabled lines was well received as we added more than 13,600 DSL customers, a 90% increase over net additions in fourth quarter 2003. Additionally, a majority of these customers selected bundles with higher speed service offerings," Post said. For first quarter 2004, CenturyTel reported, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), operating revenues of $593.7 million, a 2.7% increase from $578.0 million in first quarter 2003. The Company reported net income of $83.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $.58, compared to $83.9 million and $.58 per diluted share, respectively, in first quarter 2003. Net income in first quarter 2003 included a nonrecurring $5.0 million pre-tax partial recovery of amounts previously written off in connection with the WorldCom bankruptcy. For the second quarter 2004, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $590 to $605 million and diluted earnings per share of $.52 to $.56, which reflects $4.6 million of expenses in connection with the planned prepayment in early May of the Company's $100 million aggregate principal amount of Series B senior notes. For the full year 2004, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.35, an increase of $.15 over previously provided guidance. This increase in full year 2004 EPS guidance is primarily due to stronger first quarter revenues than expected, lower 2004 expenses than originally forecast and fewer fully diluted shares as a result of share repurchases during the first quarter. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding non-recurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investor Call.
