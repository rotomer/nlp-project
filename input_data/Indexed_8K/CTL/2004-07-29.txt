A reconciliation of this item to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. (2) In first quarter 2004, the Company began reporting long distance units on a line basis instead of a customer basis. Second quarter 2003 has been restated on a line basis to ensure period-to-period comparability. "CenturyTel achieved solid revenue and operating cash flow growth and repurchased another 4.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "We also prepaid $100 million of 8.25% senior notes in May, further strengthening CenturyTel's balance sheet and financial flexibility. While the $4.6 million prepayment costs negatively affected earnings for this quarter, the prepayment will save the Company over $8 million in annual interest expense." Operating revenues rose 2.9% to $603.6 million in second quarter 2004 from $586.7 million in second quarter 2003. This $16.8 million revenue increase primarily resulted from revenue generated by the fiber assets acquired during 2003, higher interstate access revenues related to prior periods, data revenue growth from DSL subscribers and data circuit additions, continued long distance subscriber growth and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset revenue declines attributable to lower intrastate toll revenues and universal service funding, along with access line losses. Operating expenses increased 3.8% to $413.6 million from $398.3 million in second quarter 2003 due to the fiber assets acquired during 2003, continued DSL subscriber growth and increases in plant operations expenses, marketing expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flow increased 2.4% to $320.7 million from $313.0 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 53.1% during the quarter versus 53.4% in second quarter 2003. Net income was $83.3 million compared to $87.4 million in second quarter 2003. The increase in operating income and lower interest expense was more than offset by the previously announced increase in state income taxes and a $4.6 million pre-tax charge in second quarter 2004 associated with the prepayment of the Company's $100 million Series B senior notes. Diluted earnings per share was $.60 in both second quarter 2004 and 2003. "We continue to experience good customer demand for our communications service bundles as CenturyTel achieved two significant milestones during the second quarter, surpassing 1 million long distance lines and 100,000 DSL connections," Post said. "Strong demand for high-speed Internet service drove nearly a 40% increase in DSL revenues over second quarter 2003." For the first six months of 2004, operating revenues increased to $1.197 billion from $1.165 billion for the same period in 2003, a 2.8% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $631.2 million for the first half of 2004 compared to $619.6 million a year ago, a 1.9% increase. Operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 1.4% to $373.5 million from $368.2 million in 2003. Operating cash flow and operating income for the first half of 2003 included a nonrecurring $5.0 million pre-tax partial recovery of amounts previously written off in connection with the WorldCom bankruptcy. For the first six months of 2004, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income was $166.6 million compared to $171.3 million for the first six months of 2003. Diluted earnings per share was $1.18 in the first half of 2004 compared to $1.19 in the first half of 2003. For the third quarter 2004, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $590 to $605 million and diluted earnings per share of $.56 to $.60. For the full year 2004, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35, a narrower range than our previous full year 2004 guidance due to fewer fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during the second quarter. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investor Call.
