CenturyTel Reports Third Quarter Earnings
Monroe, LA. . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for third quarter 2004 that met or exceeded First Call consensus estimates.
Operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 1.2% to $607.4 million from $600.3 million. Reported under GAAP, operating revenues increased 0.6% to $603.9 million from $600.3 million.
Operating cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, was $308.2 million.
Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $81.1 million compared to $88.5 million in third quarter 2003. Net income, reported under GAAP, was $86.2 million compared to $91.0 million in third quarter 2003.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.60 in third quarter 2004 and $.61 in third quarter 2003, while GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.63 in both third quarter 2004 and third quarter 2003.
Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, was $110.6 million in third quarter 2004.
Through the third quarter, the Company had repurchased nearly 10.9 million shares of common stock for a total investment of $318.4 million.
 
" "
CenturyTel achieved revenue growth of 1.2% and generated strong free cash flow of $110.6 million during the third quarter in a very challenging environment," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
Through the first nine months of 2004, CenturyTel generated nearly $379 million of free cash flow and returned more than $342 million to shareholders through our cash dividends and share repurchase program."
, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 1.2% to $607.4 million in third quarter 2004 from $600.3 million in third quarter 2003. Revenue increases resulted primarily from approximately $20.0 million of revenues generated by the fiber assets acquired during 2003, data revenue growth from DSL subscribers, continued long distance subscriber growth and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset revenue declines of $13.6 million attributable to anticipated lower intrastate toll revenues, universal service funding, interstate access revenues related to prior periods and the effect of access line losses.
Operating revenues
, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 4.1% to $426.2 million from $409.5 million in third quarter 2003 due primarily to the fiber assets acquired during 2003 and increases in operating taxes, customer service expenses and marketing expenses.
Operating expenses
, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 2.3% to $308.2 million from $315.5 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 50.7% during the quarter versus 52.6% in third quarter 2003.
Operating cash flow
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $81.1 million compared to $88.5 million in third quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.60 in third quarter 2004 and $.61 in third quarter 2003.
Net income
"Strong growth in long distance and data revenues as well as the continued penetration of enhanced calling features reflect CenturyTels continued success in delivering needed products and services to our customers in rural areas and smaller cities across the country," Post said.
'
operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $1.805 billion from $1.765 billion for the same period in 2003, a 2.2% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $939.5 million for 2004 compared to $935.1 million a year ago. Operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased to $554.6 million from $559.0 million in 2003.
,
For the first nine months of 2004
, net income for third quarter 2004 was $86.2 million compared to $91.0 million for third quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share for both third quarter 2004 and 2003 was $.63. For the first nine months of 2004 and 2003, net income was $252.8 million and $262.3 million, respectively, while diluted earnings per share was $1.81 and $1.82, respectively. Third quarter 2004 results reflect an after-tax $6.0 million adjustment for over depreciated assets and the related revenue effect, as well as other nonrecurring items detailed in the accompanying financial information that affected the third quarters and first nine months of 2004 and 2003.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
For the fourth quarter 2004, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $590 to $605 million and diluted earnings per share of $.56 to $.60. For the full year 2004, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.38. These outlook figures are presented excluding the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or other unusual events.
.
Outlook
The Company expects to provide full year 2005 earnings per share guidance in January 2005. The Company has, however, identified several items that can be expected to affect 2005 results. Increased national average loop costs are expected to negatively impact the Companys 2005 Universal Service Fund receipts and diluted earnings per share by $.05 to $.07. Our anticipated roll-outs of satellite entertainment and wireless services are expected to negatively impact 2005 diluted earnings per share by approximately $.05 to $.09. The Company currently anticipates, subject to market conditions and the availability of other investment opportunities, to complete its previously announced $400 million share repurchase program and to undertake transactions to mitigate the dilutive effect of the $500 million in Equity Units that are currently scheduled to settle in May 2005. Giving effect to these items, we currently anticipate 2005 interest expense will be between $200 and $210 million. These and other items that may affect 2005 results will be discussed in greater detail during our January 2005 call.
