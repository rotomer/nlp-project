Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: February 3, 2005 Media: Patricia Cameron 318.388.9674 patricia.cameron@centurytel.com Investors: Tony Davis 318.388.9525 tony.davis@centurytel.com CenturyTel Reports Fourth Quarter 2004 Earnings and Record Broadband Growth - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Monroe, La. . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2004 that met or exceeded First Call consensus estimates. o Operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $606.2 million from $601.1 million, while GAAP operating revenues increased to $606.2 million from $602.6 million. o Operating cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules) was $318.9 million. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $85.1 million compared to $89.3 million in fourth quarter 2003. Net income, reported under GAAP, was $84.5 million compared to $82.4 million in fourth quarter 2003. o Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.62 in fourth quarter 2004 and $.61 in fourth quarter 2003, while GAAP diluted earnings per share was $.62 in fourth quarter 2004 and $.56 in fourth quarter 2003. o Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, was $82.7 million in fourth quarter 2004. o CenturyTel completed its previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fourth Quarter Highlights (1) Quarter Ended Quarter Ended % Change (Excluding nonrecurring items) 12/31/04 12/31/03 (In thousands, except per share amounts and customer data) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating Revenues 606,234 601,103 .9 % Operating Cash Flow 318,920 319,954 (.3)% Net Income 85,105 89,267 (4.7)% Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) .62 .61 1.6 % Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (2) 138,368 149,433 (7.4)% Capital Expenditures 131,719 121,480 8.4 % - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Telephone Access Lines 2,313,626 2,376,118 (2.6)% Long Distance Lines (3) 1,067,817 931,761 14.6 % DSL Connections 142,575 83,465 70.8 % - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) These results include adjustments for nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. (2) Diluted earnings per share and average diluted shares outstanding reflect the application of a change in accounting related to the effect of contingent convertible debt on the diluted earnings per share calculation. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting. (3) In first quarter 2004, the Company began reporting long distance units on a line basis instead of a customer basis. Fourth quarter 2003 has been restated on a line basis to ensure period-to-period comparability. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "CenturyTel achieved record broadband subscriber growth as we added nearly 22,000 DSL connections in the fourth quarter," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Our focus on bundled offerings and delivering quality broadband solutions that provide our customers flexibility and choice resulted in full year DSL subscriber growth of nearly 71% as we ended 2004 with more than 142,000 DSL connections." - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, rose to $606.2 million in fourth quarter 2004 from $601.1 million in fourth quarter 2003. Revenue increases resulted primarily from approximately $21 million of aggregate incremental revenues generated by the regional fiber transport operations acquired during 2003, data revenue growth primarily from DSL subscribers, continued long distance subscriber growth and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset revenue declines of $17 million attributable to lower intrastate toll revenues, universal service funding, and the effect of access line losses. Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 2.0% to $416.6 million from $408.6 million in fourth quarter 2003, due primarily to costs associated with the fiber assets acquired during 2003 and DSL subscriber growth. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $318.9 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 52.6% during the quarter versus 53.2% in fourth quarter 2003. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $85.1 million compared to $89.3 million in fourth quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.62 in fourth quarter 2004, a 1.6% increase over the $.61 in fourth quarter 2003. "Data revenue growth of 12.8% for the fourth quarter and 12.7% for full year 2004 reflects our customers' strong demand for broadband solutions. Additionally, we continued to invest in our broadband networks during the year to deliver advanced communications solutions. At year end 2004, nearly 71% of our access lines were DSL-enabled. Also, we upgraded our LightCore fiber optic network to offer IP services to our wholesale and enterprise customers," Post said. For the year 2004, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $2.411 billion from $2.366 billion in 2003, a 1.9% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.258 billion for 2004 compared to $1.255 billion a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 3.8% to $332.8 million from $345.8 million in 2003, while diluted earnings per share increased to $2.38 from $2.36 in 2003. Fourth quarter and full year 2004 diluted earnings per share reflect reductions of approximately $.01 and $.035, respectively, due to the recently adopted accounting change in the calculation of earnings per share for contingent convertibles. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this accounting change. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income for fourth quarter 2004 was $84.5 million compared to $82.4 million for fourth quarter 2003. Diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2004 was $.62 compared to $.56 for fourth quarter 2003. Fourth quarter 2004 results reflect an after-tax $616,000 charge for the impairment of a non-operating investment. Fourth quarter 2003 results were negatively impacted by $6.8 million of aggregate after-tax adjustments for operating taxes and interest associated with various operating tax audits and the related revenue effect, as well as other nonrecurring items detailed in the accompanying financial information. For the year 2004, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $337.2 million, or $2.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $344.7 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, for the year 2003. The 2004 results included a favorable $4.4 million net after-tax for an adjustment for over-depreciated assets and the related revenue effect and for an adjustment for the impairment of a non-operating investment. The 2003 results included adjustments for operating taxes and interest costs associated with various operating tax audits, as well as other nonrecurring items detailed in the accompanying financial information. Other Information. Earlier today the Company announced that its Board had approved a $200 million share repurchase program and a definitive agreement to purchase for $65 million in cash certain metro fiber assets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. Guidance for 2005. As previously announced, CenturyTel expects 2005 diluted earnings per share to be negatively impacted $.05 to $.07 due to lower universal service funding. We also expect our satellite entertainment and wireless service initiatives to negatively impact diluted earnings per share an additional $.04 to $.07. CenturyTel believes the Company can continue to drive revenue growth primarily from the further penetration of its bundled offerings and continued expansion in its fiber business. Giving effect to these expectations, the incremental amortization expense related to the new billing and customer care system, the anticipation of continued access line declines and the estimated $.03 impact from the change in accounting for stock options, CenturyTel expects 2005 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.35. For first quarter 2005, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $585 to $595 million and diluted earnings per share of $.53 to $.57. The anticipated decline in revenues from fourth quarter 2004 is primarily due to a network access revenue settlement during the fourth quarter that increased revenue approximately $8 million. These outlook figures assume the successful mitigation of the dilutive effect of the $500 million in Equity Units currently scheduled to settle in May 2005, and exclude nonrecurring items, any costs associated with transactions related to the Equity Units, share repurchases, future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliations of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investor Call.

Exhibit 99.2 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: February 3, 2005 Media: Annmarie Sartor 318.388.9671 annmarie.sartor@centurytel.com Investors: Tony Davis 318.388.9525 tony.davis@centurytel.com CenturyTel announces $200 million stock repurchase program; signs definitive agreement to buy metro fiber networks MONROE, La. . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase metro fiber networks in 16 markets, primarily in the central United States, from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for $65 million cash, subject to purchase price adjustments. CenturyTel anticipates completing this transaction by third quarter 2005, subject to regulatory approval. The transition of these markets is expected to be seamless to KMC's existing customers. The transaction is anticipated to be breakeven, or slightly dilutive including transition costs, for the first 12 months of operation and accretive to earnings per share thereafter. CenturyTel will operate these networks and related assets through its LightCore subsidiary, which provides fiber optic services to national and regional communications carriers. The KMC networks being acquired include almost 1,000 lit route miles of metro fiber and more than 100 points of presence (POPs), and will bring LightCore's total network to more than 9,700 lit route miles of fiber and 618 total POPs. "This acquisition advances CenturyTel's strategic goal of continuing to grow and diversify our revenue streams by becoming a dominant fiber transport provider to smaller cities and rural areas in and near our local exchange and LightCore markets," Glen F. Post, III, CenturyTel chairman and CEO, said. "It also positions LightCore to grow the enterprise and government segments of its customer base." With this purchase, CenturyTel will add key markets to its LightCore footprint across Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Stock Repurchase Program - ------------------------ CenturyTel also announced today that its board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing it to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of either its common stock or convertible equity units. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, depending on market conditions and other factors. The program will expire in December 2005, unless extended by CenturyTel's board of directors. The new program follows CenturyTel's $400 million repurchase program, which was completed during 2004. "CenturyTel's free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet enable us to return value to shareholders through another stock repurchase program while continuing to grow our business through this strategic acquisition," Post said. As of December 31, 2004, CenturyTel had outstanding approximately 132.4 million common shares and $500 million stated value of convertible equity units. Wednesday's closing prices of CenturyTel's common stock and convertible equity units (CUSIP 156700403) were $34.05 and $25.45 per share, respectively. In addition to historical information, this release includes certain forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: Company's ability to obtain governmental approvals and third-party consents in a timely manner; the possibility of unforeseen near-term cash requirements; the ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships; the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into the Company's operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff, and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; other risks referenced from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy.
