Exhibit 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: April 28, 2005 Media: Patricia Cameron 318.388.9674 patricia.cameron@centurytel.com Investors: Tony Davis 318.388.9525 tony.davis@centurytel.com CenturyTel Reports First Quarter Earnings - ----------------------------------------- Monroe, LA. . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for first quarter 2005. o Operating revenues rose to $595.3 million from $593.7 million in first quarter 2004. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $80.0 million compared to $83.3 million in first quarter 2004. Reported under GAAP, first quarter 2005 net income was $79.6 million compared to $83.3 million in first quarter 2004. o Diluted earnings per share increased 3.5% to $.59 from $.57 in first quarter 2004 due to share repurchases during 2004. o Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules) was $137.3 million in first quarter 2005. o During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 1.78 million shares of common stock for approximately $60 million under its $200 million share repurchase program. (1) These results include adjustments for nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. "CenturyTel achieved solid financial results during the first quarter with increased revenues from DSL, long distance and fiber operations," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Our revenue from enhanced calling features also continues to grow as customer demand for our bundle offerings remains strong. More than 17% of our residential access lines were served through a bundle at the end of the first quarter with more than 60% of those bundles also including Internet or long distance service." Operating revenues rose to $595.3 million in first quarter 2005 from $593.7 million in first quarter 2004. Revenue growth of approximately $15.0 million was driven primarily by growth in DSL connections, data circuits, long distance lines and our fiber transport business and the continued penetration of enhanced calling features. These increases more than offset revenue declines of approximately $14.0 million primarily attributable to lower access revenues, universal service funding and intrastate toll revenues, along with access line losses. Operating expenses increased 2.0% to $418.4 million compared to $410.1 million in first quarter 2004. Cost of services and products increased $10.4 million primarily due to growth in DSL connections, data circuits, long distance lines and the fiber transport business. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.4 million primarily due to lower bad debt expense and employee costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $5.2 million primarily due to higher levels of plant in service and increased amortization associated with the Company's new billing system. Operating cash flow decreased to $309.0 million from $310.5 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 51.9% during the quarter versus 52.3% in first quarter 2004. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $80.0 million compared to $83.3 million in first quarter 2004, reflecting the decrease in operating income, which was partially offset by lower interest and income tax expense. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 3.5% to $.59 from $.57, due to a 7.0% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. "CenturyTel experienced stronger than expected broadband demand during the quarter, adding more than 31,000 DSL connections and ending the quarter with a penetration rate of nearly 10.5% of DSL-enabled lines. These results reflect the success of our strategic focus of owning the broadband connection to customers in our markets," Post said. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CenturyTel reported operating revenues of $595.3 million in first quarter 2005 compared to $593.7 million in first quarter 2004. In first quarter 2005, the Company reported net income of $79.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $.59, compared to $83.3 million and $.57 per diluted share, respectively, in first quarter 2004. Net income in first quarter 2005 includes $3.7 million after-tax expense related to CenturyTel's purchase and retirement of approximately $400 million of Series J Notes and $3.3 million net benefit related to the settlement of various income tax audits. For second quarter 2005, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $590 to $605 million and diluted earnings per share of $.53 to $.57. The decline in diluted earnings per share from first quarter to second quarter 2005 is primarily due to increased operating costs related to expected growth in our DSL, long distance and fiber operations, annual wage adjustments effective in the second quarter and the seasonal impact of maintenance activities for our outside plant. For the full year 2005, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 versus the previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.35, reflecting the higher than anticipated first quarter diluted earnings per share, fewer fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during the first quarter and postponement of the effective date for the change in accounting for stock options. These outlook figures for the second quarter and full year 2005 assume the successful mitigation of the dilutive effect of the Equity Units currently scheduled to settle in May 2005, and exclude any costs associated with transactions related to the Equity Units, future share repurchases, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other nonrecurring items. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available on the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investor Call.
