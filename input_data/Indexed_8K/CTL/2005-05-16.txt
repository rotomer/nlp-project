FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: May 13, 2005 Media: Annmarie Sartor 318.388.9671 annmarie.sartor@centurytel.com Investors: Tony Davis 318.388.9525 tony.davis@centurytel.com CenturyTel Prepares to Settle Equity Units MONROE, LA. . . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announced today that it will issue approximately 12.9 million shares of common stock on May 16, 2005 in exchange for approximately $398.2 million of net proceeds in full settlement of its obligations under the equity units that it publicly sold in May 2002 (NYSE: CTLPrA). Based on a pricing formula agreed to in 2002, each of the approximately 15.9 million outstanding equity units will entitle the holder to receive 0.8088 of a share of CenturyTel common stock on May 16, 2005. To mitigate dilution from the May 16 stock issuances, CenturyTel's board has authorized the Company to enter into accelerated share repurchase agreements with designated investment banks to repurchase up to 12.9 million shares of its outstanding common stock. CenturyTel also retains authority to purchase common stock between now and the date it initiates its accelerated share program under its $200 million repurchase program announced in February 2005, of which approximately $140 million remained available as of March 31, 2005. CenturyTel intends to initiate its accelerated share program no later than May 31, 2005. Upon initiation of the program, CenturyTel expects to purchase enough shares to offset the number to be issued on May 16, 2005. CenturyTel intends to fund its repurchases principally with the net proceeds that it will receive from the equity unit holders on May 16, 2005. After they sell shares to CenturyTel, the Company's investment banks will purchase an equivalent amount of CenturyTel shares in the open market over the next several months. Upon completion of these repurchases, CenturyTel anticipates that it may receive from, or be required to pay, the investment banks a price adjustment based principally upon the actual cost of the shares repurchased by the investment banks. CenturyTel expects to announce the final terms of its accelerated share repurchases after they have been completed.

Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
