EXHIBIT 99 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: July 28, 2005 Media: Patricia Cameron 318.388.9674 patricia.cameron@centurytel.com Investors: Tony Davis 318.388.9525 tony.davis@centurytel.com CenturyTel Reports Second Quarter Earnings - ------------------------------------------ MONROE, La. . . CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE Symbol: CTL) announces operating results for second quarter 2005. o Operating revenues increased to $606.4 million from $603.6 million in second quarter 2004. o Net income rose 2.2% to $85.1 million compared to $83.3 million in second quarter 2004. o Diluted earnings per share increased 8.5% to $.64 from $.59 in second quarter 2004. o Free cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules) was $113.6 million in second quarter 2005. o Through the second quarter, the Company had invested $114 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of common stock under its $200 million share repurchase program. (1) Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this item to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. "CenturyTel continued to diversify its revenue mix in the second quarter with solid year over year revenue growth in data and fiber transport services of 11.6% and 18.1%, respectively," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Further executing on this strategy, we acquired metropolitan fiber networks in 16 markets expanding the opportunity for our enterprise business and positioning us as a leading fiber transport provider near our existing markets." OPERATING REVENUES rose 0.5% to $606.4 million in second quarter 2005 from $603.6 million in second quarter 2004. This increase primarily resulted from revenue generated by data revenue growth from DSL subscribers, growth in our fiber transport business and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset revenue declines attributable to access line losses and lower access and long distance revenues. OPERATING EXPENSES increased 1.7% to $420.5 million from $413.6 million in second quarter 2004 primarily due to growth in our DSL subscriber base and increases in access expense and employee related expenses that were partially offset by lower operating taxes. OPERATING CASH FLOW decreased to $316.3 million from $320.7 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 52.2% during the quarter versus 53.1% in second quarter 2004. "We generated over $113 million of free cash flow and returned more than $60 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during the second quarter," Post said. NET INCOME increased 2.2% to $85.1 million from $83.3 million in second quarter 2004. The increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense and a $4.6 million pre-tax charge in second quarter 2004 associated with the prepayment of the Company's $100 million Series B Senior Notes. Diluted earnings per share was $.64 for second quarter 2005, an 8.5% increase from the $.59 reported in second quarter 2004, driven by higher net income and the decline in fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases since second quarter 2004. As of July 27, 2005, the investment banks that sold approximately 12.9 million shares to the Company in late May 2005 under accelerated share repurchase agreements had repurchased approximately 32% of these 12.9 million shares at a weighted average price per share of approximately $33.94. The results for second quarter 2005 and second quarter 2004 discussed above reflect results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For the first six months of 2005, operating revenues increased to $1.202 billion from $1.197 billion for the same period in 2004. Operating cash flow was $625.4 million for the first half of 2005 compared to $631.2 million a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $165.1 million in the first six months of 2005 compared to $166.6 million during the same period in 2004. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 6.0% to $1.23 during the first half of 2005 compared to $1.16 in the first half of 2004. For the first six months of 2005, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income was $164.7 compared to $166.6 million for the first six months of 2004. The $164.7 million of net income for the first half of 2005 includes $3.7 million after-tax expense related to CenturyTel's purchase and retirement of approximately $400 million of Series J Notes and $3.3 million net benefit related to the settlement of various income tax audits. For the third quarter 2005, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $635 to $650 million and diluted earnings per share of $.65 to $.70. For the full year 2005, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50, an increase over the $2.25 to $2.35 range previously provided. This increase in 2005 diluted earnings per share guidance is primarily due to the better than anticipated results during second quarter 2005, continuation of our successful cost containment efforts and fewer fully diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during the second quarter. Third quarter and full year 2005 guidance also include the anticipated results of operations attributable to the metro fiber assets acquired from KMC at the end of the second quarter. These outlook figures are presented on a GAAP basis, excluding nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or other similar business transactions. RECONCILIATION TO GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items.
