CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for third quarter 2005. o Operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 8.2% to $657.1 million from $607.4 million. Reported under GAAP, operating revenues increased 8.8% to $657.1 million from $603.9 million. o Operating cash flow (as defined in the attached financial schedules), excluding nonrecurring items, was $340.6 million. o Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $99.0 million compared to $81.1 million in third quarter 2004.

(2) Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this item to comparable GAAP measures is included in the attached financial schedules. "We continue to see strong demand for broadband and fiber transport services in our markets," Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "The mid-year addition of the KMC metro fiber assets and continued solid internal growth in our LightCore operations drove revenue growth of $17.2 million, a 90% increase in fiber transport and CLEC revenues since third quarter 2004." Operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, rose 8.2% to $657.1 million in third quarter 2005 from $607.4 million in third quarter 2004. Revenue increases aggregating $56 million resulted primarily from approximately $13.8 million of revenues generated by the metro fiber assets acquired in second quarter 2005, $34.2 million related to adjustments to recognize prior period revenue settlements, and data revenue growth from DSL subscribers. These increases more than offset revenue declines of $10.2 million attributable to previously anticipated lower intrastate toll revenues, universal service funding and access line losses. Operating expenses, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 5.6% to $450.0 million from $426.2 million in third quarter 2004 due primarily to the fiber assets acquired during second quarter 2005 and strong growth in the broadband business. "One of our key strategies is to be the broadband provider of choice in our markets. We continued to make progress in this area as we added more than 25,000 DSL connections during the third quarter, more than double the 12,000 added in third quarter 2004," Post said. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 10.5% to $340.6 million from $308.2 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 51.8% during the quarter versus 50.7% in third quarter 2004. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $99.0 million compared to $81.1 million in third quarter 2004. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.74 in third quarter 2005 and $.59 in third quarter 2004. As of October 26, 2005, approximately 82% of the 12.9 million shares under the Company's accelerated share repurchase agreements had been repurchased at a weighted average price per share of approximately $34.50. For the first nine months of 2005, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $1.859 billion from $1.805 billion for the same period in 2004, a 3.0% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $966.0 million for 2005 compared to $939.5 million a year ago. Operating income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $569.8 million from $554.6 million in 2004. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net income for third quarter 2005 was $91.4 million compared to $86.2 million for third quarter 2004. Diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2005 and 2004 was $.68 and $.63, respectively. For the first nine months of 2005 and 2004, net income was $256.1 million and $252.8 million, respectively, while diluted earnings per share was $1.91 and $1.79, respectively. As explained further in the attached financial schedules, third quarter 2005 results reflect a net after-tax charge of $7.6 million from expenses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and transactions related to certain non-operating investments. Third quarter 2004 results reflect an after-tax $6.0 million adjustment for over depreciated assets and the related revenue effect. Other nonrecurring items that affected the third quarters and first nine months of 2005 and 2004 are detailed in the accompanying financial information. Outlook. For fourth quarter 2005, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $610 to $620 million and diluted earnings per share of $.52 to $.56. As a result of better than anticipated third quarter performance, the Company has increased and narrowed the range of anticipated full year 2005 diluted earnings per share guidance to $2.49 to $2.53. All outlook figures provided under this section are presented excluding the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or other unusual events. CenturyTel expects to provide full year 2006 earnings per share guidance in January 2006. The Company has, however, identified several items that can be expected to affect 2006 results when compared to 2005. Increased national average loop costs are expected to negatively impact the Company's 2006 Universal Service Fund receipts and diluted earnings per share by $.06 to $.08. Revenue settlements related to prior periods are anticipated to decline and negatively impact 2006 diluted earnings per share by $.14 to $.18. The change in accounting for stock options is anticipated to negatively impact 2006 diluted earnings per share by $.05 to $.06. CenturyTel currently expects lower 2006 interest expense to contribute $.03 to $.05 to 2006 diluted earnings per share. Upon completion of its accelerated share repurchase program later this year, the Company currently anticipates completing the remaining $86 million outstanding under its $200 million share repurchase program. Additionally, CenturyTel believes it will continue to drive growth in its broadband and fiber transport businesses. These and other items that may affect 2006 results will be discussed further during the Company's fourth quarter 2005 earnings call in early 2006. Reconciliation to GAAP. This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Company's performance, we believe these measurements assist readers in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Company's Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investor Call.

In addition to historical information, this release includes certain forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Company's ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly-acquired businesses into the Company's operations and hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Company's ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; the Company's ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms; other risks referenced from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the Company's business are described in greater detail in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to identify all such factors, nor can it predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements.
