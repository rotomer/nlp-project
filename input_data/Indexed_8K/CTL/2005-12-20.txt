Item 1.01.
 
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On December 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CenturyTel, Inc. (the Company) approved accelerating the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding (which as of December 14, 2005 totaled 1,474,571) under the Companys management incentive compensation plans, effective as of December 31, 2005. The options are held by executive officers, officers and employees and have a range of exercise prices between $26.51 and $35.79 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $30.68 per share. The closing price per share of the Companys common stock on December 14, 2005 was $34.25. All other terms of the options remained unchanged.
The Committee accelerated the vesting period to eliminate the Companys recognition of compensation expense associated with these options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which will apply to the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2006. The Companys aggregate pre-tax compensation expense that will be avoided is approximately $4.9 million, of which approximately $4.1 million would have been recognized in 2006. The Company will recognize additional pre-tax compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of accelerating the vesting of these options; however, such amount is expected to be less than $300,000.
Of the total number of options accelerated, executive officers of the Company hold options to purchase an aggregate of  709,646 shares of common stock. In order to offset unintended personal benefit to the executive officers, shares of the Companys common stock received upon exercise of an accelerated option by an executive officer may not be sold or otherwise transferred prior to the expiration of the options original vesting period. The following table sets forth the grant date, the number of options accelerated and the exercise prices of each such option held by the Companys executive officers.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
