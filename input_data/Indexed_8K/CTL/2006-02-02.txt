CenturyTel Reports Fourth Quarter 2005 Earnings
MONROE, La... CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2005 that exceeded First Call consensus estimates.
 
CenturyTel achieved strong cash flows during 2005, generating more than $463 million of free cash flow for the year, Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. Our continued focus on owning the broadband connection to our customers drove the addition of nearly 29,000 high-speed Internet subscribers during the fourth quarter and more than 106,000 for the full year 2005, an increase of nearly 75% since year end 2004.
 
Operating revenues
rose to $620.5 million in fourth quarter 2005 from $606.2 million in fourth quarter 2004. Revenue increases resulted primarily from $13.9 million of revenues generated by the metro fiber assets acquired June 30, 2005 and $15.3 million of aggregate revenues related to increased DSL subscribers, continued growth in our fiber transport business and increased enhanced calling feature penetration. These increases more than offset anticipated revenue declines of $14.3 million attributable to lower access revenues, reduced universal service funding, and access line losses.
Operating expenses
increased 7.5% to $448.1 million from $416.6 million in fourth quarter 2004, due primarily to costs associated with the metro fiber assets acquired June 30, 2005, DSL subscriber growth and expenses associated with our new video and wireless reseller initiatives.
During 2005, we continued to position CenturyTel for the future by expanding and strengthening our broadband capabilities, acquiring strategic metro fiber assets, launching satellite television service to most of our markets and introducing wireless and switched digital television services in select markets, Post said.
Operating cash flow
for fourth quarter 2005 was $308.2 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 49.7% during the quarter versus 52.6% in fourth quarter 2004. This margin decline was expected due to the growth in lower margin revenues versus the anticipated decline in higher margin revenues discussed above.
Net income
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $82.2 million compared to $85.1 million in fourth quarter 2004. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.61 in fourth quarter 2005 and $.62 in fourth quarter 2004.
For the year 2005
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $2.479 billion from $2.411 billion in 2004, a 2.8% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.274 billion for 2005 compared to $1.258 billion a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 4.0% to $346.3 million from $332.8 million in 2004, while diluted earnings per share increased to $2.58 from $2.38 in 2004.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
, net income for fourth quarter 2005 was $78.3 million compared to $84.5 million for fourth quarter 2004. Diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2005 was $.59 compared to $.62 for fourth quarter 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 and fourth quarter 2004 results reflect after-tax charges of $3.9 million and $.6 million, respectively, related to the impairment of certain non-operating investments.
 
For the year 2005, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $334.5 million, or $2.49 per diluted share, compared to net income of $337.2 million, or $2.41 per diluted share, for the year 2004. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2005 and 2004.
Outlook for 2006.
As previously announced, CenturyTel expects 2006 diluted earnings per share to be negatively impacted by $.14 to $.18 due to settlement revenues recognized in 2005 that are not expected to occur in 2006 and positively impacted by $.03 to $.05 from lower 2006 interest expense. We also anticipate our satellite entertainment, wireless and digital television service initiatives will negatively impact 2006 diluted earnings per share an additional $.03 to $.05. CenturyTel believes the Company can continue to drive revenue growth primarily from the further penetration of its bundled offerings and continued expansion in its fiber business. Giving effect to these items, the anticipation of access line declines of 4.5% to 5.5% in 2006, the $.04 to $.06 negative impact of expected lower universal service funding and the estimated $.02 to $.03 negative impact from the change in accounting for stock options, CenturyTel expects 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.35.
CenturyTel expects first quarter 2006 total revenues of $605 to $615 million and diluted earnings per share of $.52 to $.56. The anticipated decline in revenues from fourth quarter 2005 is primarily due to access line declines and anticipated lower universal service funding.
The Company expects a reduction in its capital expenditures in 2006 to approximately $325 million, a $90 million decrease from 2005. Subject to incremental investments related to new initiatives that drive growth or efficiencies, CenturyTel expects to maintain capital expenditures at a similar level beyond 2006. CenturyTel also anticipates receiving approximately $120 million in cash on a pre-tax basis in the first half of 2006 from the redemption of its Rural Telephone Bank stock.
These 2006 outlook figures exclude nonrecurring items, future share repurchase initiatives, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions.
