Exhibit 99
 
CenturyTel Reports Second Quarter Earnings
Monroe, La CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL
) announces operating results for second quarter 2006.
 
 
 
   
 
CenturyTel delivered solid results as we experienced strong demand for broadband services and communications bundles during the quarter, Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. The 60% growth in high-speed Internet customers and 45% growth in related revenues over the past twelve months reflect CenturyTels focus on being the broadband provider of choice in our markets.
 
Operating revenues
rose 0.4% to $609.1 million in second quarter 2006 from $606.4 million in second quarter 2005. This increase primarily resulted from revenues from metro fiber assets acquired in mid-2005 and data revenue growth from high-speed Internet subscribers. These increases more than offset revenue declines attributable to access line losses and lower access revenues.
Operating expenses
increased 5.6% to $443.9 million from $420.5 million in second quarter 2005 primarily due to growth in our high-speed Internet connections and expenses related to the metro fiber assets acquired in mid-2005.
 
Operating cash flow
 
decreased to $297.1 million from $316.3 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 48.8% during the quarter versus 52.2% in second quarter 2005. This margin decline was principally driven by access line losses and lower USF and access revenues, along with the growth in lower margin services such as high-speed Internet, fiber transport and CLEC.
Net income
,
excluding nonrecurring items, was $73.6 million in second quarter 2006 compared to $85.1 million in second quarter 2005. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in operating cash flow discussed above. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.61 for second quarter 2006, a 4.7% decrease from the $.64 reported in second quarter 2005. This decrease was driven by lower net income, which was partially offset by the 10.1% decline in average diluted shares outstanding that was a result of share repurchases since second quarter 2005.
As announced July 19, 2006, all repurchases under the Companys February 2006 accelerated share repurchase agreements entered into with investment banks for approximately 14.36 million shares were recently completed and CenturyTel paid the banks $28.4 million cash as final settlement of the agreements. The Company has $500 million remaining under its $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in February of this year.
We are pleased that the accelerated share repurchase program was completed in less than five months. We currently expect to continue purchasing shares under the remaining $500 million in the open market, Post said.
 
For the first six months of 2006
,
operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $1.219 billion from $1.202 billion for the same period in 2005. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $594.7 million for the first half of 2006 compared to $625.4 million a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $146.0 million in the first six months of 2006 compared to $165.1 million during the same period in 2005.
 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.19 during the first half of 2006 compared to $1.23 in the first half of 2005.
 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
, net income for second quarter 2006 was $152.4 million compared to $85.1 million for second quarter 2005 and diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2006 was $1.26 compared to $.64 for second quarter 2005. Second quarter 2006 net income and diluted earnings per share include a $72.4 million after-tax benefit related to the dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank and a $6.4 million positive impact from the resolution of various income tax audit issues.
 
Net income under GAAP for the first six months of 2006 was $221.8 million compared to $164.7 million for the first six months of 2005 and diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2006 was $1.80 compared to $1.23 for the first six months of 2005. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005.
 
For the third quarter 2006
, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $605 to $615 million and diluted earnings per share of $.57 to $.61. For the full year 2006, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45, an increase over the $2.30 to $2.40 range previously provided. This increase in 2006 diluted earnings per share guidance is primarily due to the better than anticipated results during second quarter 2006 and the expectation of operating costs being lower in the second half of 2006 than previously anticipated.
These outlook figures exclude nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, refinancing, share repurchases or other similar business transactions.
 
Reconciliation to GAAP
.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Companys Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Companys ability to effectively manage its expansion opportunities, including retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Companys ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; the Companys ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effect of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC); and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in
operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the Companys business are described in greater detail in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, as updated by the Companys subsequent SEC reports. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to identify all such factors, nor can it predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release.
