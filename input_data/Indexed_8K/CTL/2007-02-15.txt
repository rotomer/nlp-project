CenturyTel Reports Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings
Monroe, La... CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2006.
 
 
 
 (1) 
   
   
Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this item to comparable GAAP measures 
is included in the attached financial schedules.
 (2) Excluding adjustments during 2006 to reflect the removal of test lines, database conversion and clean-up, and the sale of our Arizona properties, access line losses for 2006 were
   
   
   approximately
   
   
  
107,000, a year-over-year line loss of 4.8%.
CenturyTel generated a record $512 million of free cash flow during 2006, reflecting our continued success in aligning our costs and capital deployment with the changing landscape of our industry, Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. At the same time, we invested more than $300 million in our business and returned more than $800 million to shareholders through the repurchase of more than 21 million common shares.
 
 
   
Operating revenues
were $607.7 million in fourth quarter 2006 compared to $620.5 million in fourth quarter 2005. Revenue increases during the quarter of approximately $17 million resulted primarily from an increase in high-speed Internet customers and growth in fiber transport revenues, as well as new initiatives. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines of approximately $30 million primarily attributable to previously anticipated lower access revenues, reduced universal service funding, and access line losses.
 
 
   
Operating expenses
decreased 3.1% to $434 million from $448 million in fourth quarter 2005, principally due to a $9.4 million decline in depreciation expense primarily associated with fully depreciated assets. Additionally, cash expenses were $4.6 million lower than in fourth quarter 2005 driven primarily by lower marketing, personnel and contract labor costs that more than offset increased expenses associated with new initiatives, long distance usage and growth in high-speed Internet customers.
CenturyTel remains focused on being the broadband provider of choice in our markets. Customer demand for high-quality broadband service drove more than 29,000 high-speed Internet additions during the quarter resulting in over 120,000 net additions for the full year, a 48.2% annual increase, Post said. We also expanded our addressable market for broadband services during the quarter with the launch of CenturyTels first mesh-WiFi network in Vail, Colorado.
 
 
   
Operating cash flow
for fourth quarter 2006 was $300.0 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 49.4% during the quarter versus 49.7% in fourth quarter 2005. This margin decline was expected due to the growth in lower margin revenues versus the anticipated decline in higher margin revenues discussed above.
 
 
   
Net income
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $79.4 million compared to $82.2 million in fourth quarter 2005. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $.68 in fourth quarter 2006 compared to $.61 in fourth quarter 2005, primarily due to the reduction in diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during 2006.
 
 
   
For the year 2006
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, were $2.446 billion compared to $2.479 billion in 2005, a 1.4% decrease. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.197 billion for 2006 compared to $1.274 billion a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $303.0 million compared to $346.3 million in 2005, while diluted earnings per share was $2.52 compared to $2.58 in 2005.
 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
, net income for fourth quarter 2006 was $72.2 million compared to $78.3 million for fourth quarter 2005. Diluted earnings per share was $.62 in fourth quarter 2006 compared to $.59 in fourth quarter 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 and fourth quarter 2005 results reflect after-tax charges of $7.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, related to impairment charges associated with certain non-operating investments.
For the year 2006, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $370.0 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $334.5 million, or $2.49 per diluted share, for the year 2005. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2006 and 2005.
Outlook for 2007.
For full year 2007, CenturyTel expects 2007 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. As previously communicated, the Company expects revenue settlements related to prior periods to positively impact 2007 diluted earnings per share by $.17 to $.22. CenturyTel also expects share repurchases made during 2006 and January 2007 along with modestly lower interest expense to positively impact 2007 diluted earnings per share by $.10 to $.15. Additionally, CenturyTel believes it will continue to drive growth from the further penetration of its broadband service offerings and continued expansion in its fiber business that is anticipated to positively impact 2007 diluted earnings per share by $.08 to $.12, excluding depreciation expense. Also, lower depreciation expense, primarily due to certain telephone assets becoming fully depreciated that more than offsets higher depreciation related to broadband investments and new initiatives, is anticipated to positively impact 2007 diluted earnings per share by $.03 to $.05. These increases are expected to more than offset the negative impact on 2007 diluted earnings per share of $.30 to $.35 related to anticipated access line losses of 4.5% to 6.0% and continued pressure on access revenues.
For first quarter 2007, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $600 to $610 million and diluted earnings per share of $.60 to $.65.
Finally, the Company expects its capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately $325 million, a slight increase over the $314 million expended in 2006.
These 2007 outlook figures exclude nonrecurring items, any share repurchases made after January 31, 2007, the pending acquisition of Madison River Communications Corp. and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions.
Other
.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, CenturyTel adopted the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), which required the results of operations previously reported in the first, second and third quarters of 2006 to be adjusted.
 
The attached schedules reflect the nature of the adjustments and reconcile amounts previously reported to those amounts as adjusted for the application of SAB 108, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
In addition, the Companys stockholders equity was reduced approximately $98 million during fourth quarter 2006 upon the adoption of SFAS 158, which requires companies to reflect the unrecognized actuarial loss related to pension and post-retirement plans as a reduction in stockholders equity.
Reconciliation to GAAP
.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial statements. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Companys Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to historical information, this release includes certain forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Companys ability to effectively manage its expansion opportunities, including successfully financing and timely consummating pending acquisitions, successfully integrating newly-acquired properties into the Companys operations, and retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; the Companys ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; the Companys ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effect of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC); and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the Companys business are described in greater detail in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, as updated by the Companys subsequent SEC reports. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to identify all such factors, nor can it predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. The information contained in this release is as of February 15, 2007. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements for any reason.
