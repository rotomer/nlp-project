Item 1.01.       Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
            On March 26, 2007, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and the other underwriters named in Schedule 1 thereto (the Underwriters), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $750 million of our debt securities, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Senior Notes, Series N, due 2017 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, Series O, due 2013 (collectively, the Notes).
            We completed the sale of the Notes on March 29, 2007.  The net proceeds to us from the sale of the Notes, after deducting the Underwriters discount and our estimated offering expenses, are expected to be approximately $741.5 million.  For additional information on our offering, please see our press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report. 
            Certain underwriters or their affiliates may engage, or have engaged, in various general financing and banking transactions from time to time with us or our affiliates for which they have received, or will receive, customary compensation.  Affiliates of most of the underwriters are lenders under our existing $750 million revolving credit facility, and each of these lenders or their affiliates act as either joint bookrunners, co-lead arrangers, administrative agents, syndication agents or co-documentation agents under this facility.  For additional information on these relationships and the terms of the Notes, see our prospectus supplement, dated March 26, 2007, which we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-84276, dated March 14, 2002.  A copy of the Underwriting Agreement and the related Price Determination Agreement are filed as Exhibits 1.1 and 1.2 to this Report.

(b)
  
Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation

No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
  
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company
 
and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by
pro rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e)
  
The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
8.
   
  
Substitution of Underwriters
. If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase, in the proportions which the principal amount of Securities which they have respectively agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities which all such non-defaulting Underwriters have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as such non-defaulting Underwriters may specify; provided that in no event shall the maximum principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by more than one-ninth of the principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter without the prior written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase any Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities and arrangements satisfactory to any non-defaulting Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company for the purchase or sale of any Securities under this Agreement. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
9.
 
   
Termination
. Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder or (ii) any condition to the Underwriters obligations hereunder is not fulfilled at or prior to the Closing.

Dated:  March 29, 2007
 
 This Series N Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the Securities) issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 31, 1994, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the Fourth Supplemental Indenture) dated as of March 26, 2007 (collectively, the Indenture), between the Corporation and Regions Bank (successor-in-interest to First American Bank & Trust of Louisiana and Regions Bank of Louisiana), as trustee (the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 6.00% Senior Notes, Series N, due 2017 (the ).  Such series is being initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000.  Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
   
Series N Notes
 The Series N Notes are redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the Corporations option, at a redemption price equal to the greater (a) of 100% of the principal amount of the Series N Notes to be redeemed; and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Series N Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points.  In each case the Corporation will pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. 
   
 The Corporation will mail notice of redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Series N Notes to be redeemed at its registered address.  The notice of redemption for the Series N Notes will state, among other things, the amount of Series N Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Series N Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Series N Notes that have been called for redemption at the redemption date.
   
 If less than all of the Series N Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will be notified at least 45 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of Series N Notes to be redeemed and the redemption date. The Trustee will select by lot, or in such other manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Series N Notes to be redeemed in part.
   
 If the Corporation gives notice as provided in the Indenture, and funds for the redemption of any Series N Notes (or any portion thereof) called for redemption will have been made available on the redemption date referred to in such notice, those Series N Notes (or any portion thereof) will cease to bear interest on that redemption date and the only right of the holders of those Series N Notes will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
   
 The Series N Notes are redeemable on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price in the event that, for any reason, (a) the Proposed Acquisition has not been completed on or prior to July 31, 2007; or (b) the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated (without the Proposed Acquisition being completed) on or prior to July 31, 2007.
   
 Notice of a special mandatory redemption will be mailed promptly after the occurrence of the event triggering redemption to each holder of Series N Notes at its registered address. If funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (including any accrued and unpaid interest) of all Series N Notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date are deposited with the Paying Agent on or before such Special Mandatory Redemption Date, on and after such Special Mandatory Redemption Date the Series N Notes will cease to bear interest.
   
 If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Corporation is required or has exercised its right to redeem the Series N Notes as described above, it will make an offer to each holder of Series N Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000) of such holders Series N Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Series N Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Series N Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
   
 Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Corporations option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Corporation will mail a notice to each holder of Series N Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and (i) offering to repurchase the Series N Notes on the repurchase date specified in the notice, which date will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, (ii) indicating that all Series N Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment and any Series N Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iii) specifying the CUSIP numbers for the Series N Notes, (iv) stating that, unless the Corporation defaults in its payment in connection with the Change of Control Repurchase Event, all Series N Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Corporations offer to repurchase such Series N Notes will cease to accrue interest after such repurchase, (v) stating that holders electing to have any Series N Notes repurchased by the Corporation will be required to surrender such Series N Notes to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the repurchase date, (vi) stating that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the repurchase date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Series N Notes, the principal amount of Series N Notes delivered for repurchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing his election to have the Series N Notes repurchased and (vii) stating that holders whose Series N Notes are being repurchased only in part will be issued new Series N Notes in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Series N Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
   
 The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Corporations offer to repurchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date specified in the notice.  The Corporation will cause its offer to purchase to remain open for at least 20 Business Days or such longer period as is required by applicable law. The Corporation will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Series N Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Series N Notes, the Corporation will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 4.03 of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
   
 On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Corporation will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all the Series N Notes or portions of the Series N Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Corporations offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all the Series N Notes or portions of the Series N Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Series N Notes properly accepted, together with an officers certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Series N Notes being purchased by the Corporation.
   
 The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Series N Notes properly tendered the repurchase price for such Series N Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Series N Note of the same series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Series N Notes surrendered, if any; that each new Series N Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Corporation will publicly announce the results of its offer to repurchase the Series N Notes on or as soon as practicable after the repurchase date.
   
provided
 The Corporation will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series N Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to an offer made by the Corporation and such third party purchases all Series N Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such third partys offer.

Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, shall forthwith cease to be payable to the holders at the close of business on such Regular Record Date and may be paid by the Corporation to the Person in whose name this Series O Note is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall not be more than 15 or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of such proposed payment, and notice of which shall be given to the holders of the Series O Notes not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Series O Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. 
   
 Principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Series O Note shall be payable at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in the City of Monroe, State of Louisiana, or the Borough of Manhattan, The City and State of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Corporation by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the security register; and provided further, that, in the case of payments of principal and premium, if any, this Series O Note is first surrendered to the Paying Agent.
   
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as this Series O Note is represented by a Global Series O Note, payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series O Note will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as the initial holder of this Series O Note.
   
 The indebtedness evidenced by this Series O Note is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, senior and unsecured and will rank in right of payment on parity with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Corporation.

By:
                                                                  
            Authorized Officer
 
Dated:  March 29, 2007
 
 
 This Series O Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the Securities) issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 31, 1994, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the Fourth Supplemental Indenture) dated as of March 26, 2007 (collectively, the Indenture), between the Corporation and Regions Bank (successor-in-interest to First American Bank & Trust of Louisiana and Regions Bank of Louisiana), as trustee (the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 5.50% Senior Notes, Series O, due 2013 (the ).  Such series is being initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000.  Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
   
Series O Notes
 The Series O Notes are redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the Corporations option, at a redemption price equal to the greater (a) of 100% of the principal amount of the Series O Notes to be redeemed; and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Series O Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points.  In each case the Corporation will pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. 
   
 The Corporation will mail notice of redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Series O Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Series O Notes will state, among other things, the amount of Series O Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Series O Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Series O Notes that have been called for redemption at the redemption date.
   
 If less than all of the Series O Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will be notified at least 45 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of Series O Notes to be redeemed and the redemption date. The Trustee will select by lot, or in such other manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Series O Notes to be redeemed in part.
   
 If the Corporation gives notice as provided in the Indenture, and funds for the redemption of any Series O Notes (or any portion thereof) called for redemption will have been made available on the redemption date referred to in such notice, those Series O Notes (or any portion thereof) will cease to bear interest on that redemption date and the only right of the holders of those Series O Notes will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
   
 If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Corporation has exercised its right to redeem the Series O Notes as described above, it will make an offer to each holder of Series O Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000) of such holders Series O Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Series O Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Series O Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
   
 Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Corporations option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Corporation will mail a notice to each holder of Series O Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and (i) offering to repurchase the Series O Notes on the repurchase date specified in the notice, which date will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, (ii) indicating that all Series O Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment and any Series O Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iii) specifying the CUSIP numbers for the Series O Notes, (iv) stating that, unless the Corporation defaults in its payment in connection with the Change of Control Repurchase Event, all Series O Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Corporations offer to repurchase such Series O Notes will cease to accrue interest after such repurchase, (v) stating that holders electing to have any Series O Notes repurchased by the Corporation will be required to surrender such Series O Notes to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the repurchase date, (vi) stating that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the repurchase date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Series O Notes, the principal amount of Series O Notes delivered for repurchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing his election to have the Series O Notes repurchased and (vii) stating that holders whose Series O Notes are being repurchased only in part will be issued new Series O Notes in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Series O Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
   
 The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Corporations offer to repurchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date specified in the notice.  The Corporation will cause its offer to purchase to remain open for at least 20 Business Days or such longer period as is required by applicable law. The Corporation will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Series O Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event.  To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Series O Notes, the Corporation will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 4.03 of the Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
   
 On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Corporation will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all the Series O Notes or portions of the Series O Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Corporations offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all the Series O Notes or portions of the Series O Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Series O Notes properly accepted, together with an officers certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Series O Notes being purchased by the Corporation.
   
 The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Series O Notes properly tendered the repurchase price for such Series O Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Series O Note of the same series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Series O Notes surrendered, if any; that each new Series O Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Corporation will publicly announce the results of its offer to repurchase the Series O Notes on or as soon as practicable after the repurchase date.
   
provided
 The Corporation will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series O Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to an offer made by the Corporation and such third party purchases all Series O Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such third partys offer.

 Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
   
 Continuing Directors means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Corporations board of directors who (1) was a member of such board of directors on March 29, 2007; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.

 Moodys means Moodys Investors Service Inc.
   
 Rating Agency means (1) each of Moodys and S&P; and (2) if either of Moodys or S&P ceases to rate the Series O Notes or fails to make a rating of the Series O Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Corporations control, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3l(e)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Corporation (as certified by a resolution of the Corporations board of directors) as a replacement agency for Moodys or S&P, or both, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in Rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event set forth above) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in Rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).

 Regular Record Date means, with respect to any Interest Payment Date for the Series O Notes, the March 15 and September 15 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.
   
 Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Series O Notesto be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
   
 The Series O Notes are not subject to, the benefit of, and do not have, any sinking fund.
   
 In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Series O Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of the Series O Notes may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
   
 The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Corporation and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected at the time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating and of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Securities, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities or any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of each Security then Outstanding and affected thereby.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series.  Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
   
provided, however,
 No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series O Noteor of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Series O Note at the times and place and at the rate and in the currency herein prescribed.
   
 As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Series O Note is registrable in the security register, upon surrender of this Series O Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series O Notes, of this series, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
   
 As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the holder of this Series O  Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Series O Notes, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series O Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Series O Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.  The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the holder of this Series O Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
   
 Prior to due presentment of this Series O Note for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Series O Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Series O Note be overdue and notwithstanding the notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the security registrar, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
   
 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or any premium or the interest on this Series O Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, affiliate, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Corporation or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
   
 The Series O Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations therein set forth, Series O Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series O Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Series O Note or Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Corporation.
   
 This Series O Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Louisiana.
   
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
