CenturyTel Reports Second Quarter 2007 Earnings
MONROE, La... CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for second quarter 2007.
 
 
excluding nonrecurring items, increased 5.0% to $639.1 million in second quarter 2007 compared to $608.9 million in second quarter 2006, driven by the $32.1 million in revenues contributed by the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007. Other revenue increases during the quarter of approximately $23 million resulted primarily from an increase in high-speed Internet customers and growth in fiber transport revenues. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines of approximately $25 million primarily attributable to previously anticipated lower access revenues, access line losses and lower revenues under the amended satellite television agreement.
Operating revenues,
 
 
excluding nonrecurring items, increased 4.1% to $462.2 million from $443.9 million in second quarter 2006, primarily due to operating costs associated with the Madison River properties. Excluding costs associated with the Madison River properties, operating expenses declined in second quarter 2007 compared to second quarter 2006, primarily due to lower bad debt expense, reduced personnel expenses and outside labor costs, lower expenses under the amended satellite television agreement, and lower depreciation expense associated with fully depreciated assets. These declines more than offset increased expenses associated with growth in high-speed Internet and fiber transport customers.
Operating expenses
,
CenturyTels financial strength allowed us to complete both the Madison River acquisition and our $1 billion share repurchase program with the repurchase of 2.9 million shares for $136 million during the quarter, Post said. We continue to retain significant financial flexibility and expect to utilize free cash flow to drive long-term shareholder value.
 
excluding nonrecurring items, for second quarter 2007 was $311.2 million. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin of 48.7% during the quarter versus 48.8% in second quarter 2006.
Operating cash flow
,
 
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $78.4 million compared to $73.4 million in second quarter 2007. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased to $.70 in second quarter 2007 compared to $.61 in second quarter 2006, primarily due to increased operating income and the reduction in diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during the twelve months ended June 30, 2007.
Net income
 
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, were $1.240 billion compared to $1.219 billion in 2006, a 1.7% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $607.1 million for 2007 compared to $594.8 million a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $156.3 million compared to $145.7 million in 2006, while diluted earnings per share was $1.38 compared to $1.19 in 2006.
For the first six months of 2007
, net income for second quarter 2007 was $112.3 million compared to $152.2 million for second quarter 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $1.00 in second quarter 2007 compared to $1.26 in second quarter 2006. Second quarter 2007 results include a $30.2 million after-tax positive revenue settlement related to the resolution of network access disputes and a $3.6 million after-tax benefit related to the amended satellite television agreement with Echostar. Second quarter 2006 results include a $72.4 million after-tax benefit related to the dissolution of the Rural Telephone Bank and a $6.4 million positive impact from the resolution of various income tax audit issues.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
For the first six months of 2007, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company reported net income of $190.1 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to net income of $221.5 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2006. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2007 and 2006.
,CenturyTel expects total revenues of $690 to $700 million and diluted earnings per share of $.87 to $.92.  The finalization of revenue settlements during the third quarter is expected to result in an approximate $.23 increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2007, diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.00, an increase over the $2.75 to $2.85 range previously provided. This increase in 2007 diluted earnings per share guidance is primarily due to the better than anticipated results during second quarter 2007, projected increases in Internet and long distance revenues, and the expectation that operating expenses will be lower in the second half of 2007 than previously forecast, along with the anticipation of a modest contribution from the Madison River properties.
For the third quarter 2007
 
These outlook figures assume conversion of our $165 million of Series K convertible debentures and exclude nonrecurring items and the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, refinancing, share repurchases or other similar business transactions.
As previously reported, CenturyTel adopted the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108) in fourth quarter 2006, which required the results of operations previously reported in the first, second and third quarters of 2006 to be adjusted.  Second quarter 2006 and six months ended June 30, 2006 amounts included in this press release reflect amounts adjusted for the application of SAB 108.
