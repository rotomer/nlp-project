News Release
 
 
CenturyTel Reports Second Quarter 2008 Earnings
MONROE, La... CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for second quarter 2008.
 
 
 
 
CenturyTel achieved solid second quarter results as operating revenues and diluted earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the quarter, Glen F. Post, III, chairman and chief executive officer, said. We generated free cash flow of more than $162 million for the quarter, a nearly 5% increase over second quarter
2007. Our strong cash flows enable us to return significant cash to shareholders through our recently announced dividend increase and the acceleration of our current share repurchase program.
 
 excluding nonrecurring items, increased 2.8% to $657.1 million in second quarter 2008 compared to $639.1 million in second quarter 2007. Revenue increases of approximately $41 million were driven primarily by revenues contributed by the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007 and growth in high-speed Internet customers, along with selected price increases and favorable network access dispute settlements. These increases more than offset revenue declines of approximately $23 million primarily attributable to lower access revenues, lower universal service fund receipts and access line losses.
Operating revenues,
 
 
excluding nonrecurring items, increased 1.6% to $469.8 million from $462.2 million in second quarter 2007, primarily due to operating costs associated with the Madison River properties, growth in high-speed Internet customers and increased marketing expenses. These increases were partially offset by reduced personnel related costs and lower depreciation expense.
Operating expenses
,
We completed the integration of the Madison River properties in late June and expect to reach our $17 million annual synergy run rate target by the end of the third quarter, Post said. We expect these synergies, along with continued broadband growth and cost containment efforts, to enable CenturyTel to continue to generate solid cash flows in the months ahead.
 
excluding nonrecurring items, for second quarter 2008 increased 2.3% to $318.3 million from $311.2 million in second quarter 2007. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin
Operating cash flow
,
of 48.4%
during the
quarter versus 48.7% in second quarter 2007.
 
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $91.2 million, a 16.2% increase over the $78.4 million in second quarter 2007. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 24.3% to $.87 in second quarter 2008 compared to $.70 in second quarter 2007, primarily due to increased operating income, lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate for 2008 and the reduction in diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases.
Net income
 
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, were $1.31 billion compared to $1.24 billion in 2007, a 5.3% increase. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items,
For the first six months of 2008
was $637.4
million for 2008, a 5.0% increase over the $607.1 million a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 13.5% to $177.3 million from $156.3 million in 2007, while diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 21.7% to $1.68 from $1.38 in 2007.
, net income for second quarter 2008 was $92.2 million compared to $112.3 million for second quarter 2007. Diluted earnings per share was $.88 in second quarter 2008 compared to $1.00 in second quarter 2007. Second quarter 2008 results include a net $1.3 million after-tax charge related to the freeze of our supplemental executive pension plan and a net $2.3 million benefit related to the resolution of certain income tax audit issues. Second quarter 2007 results include a $30.2 million after-tax positive revenue settlement related to the resolution of network access disputes and a $3.6 million after-tax benefit related to the amended satellite television agreement with EchoStar.
 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
For the first six months of 2008, under GAAP, the Company reported net income of $180.9 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to net income of $190.1 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2007. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2008 and 2007.
,CenturyTel expects total revenues of $640 to $650 million and diluted earnings per share of $.79 to $.83.  This decrease in revenues and diluted earnings per share compared to second quarter 2008 is primarily due to approximately $6 million in favorable revenue adjustments recognized in the second quarter, including the network access dispute settlements management discussed during the Companys first quarter earnings call, that are not expected to reoccur in the third quarter.
For third quarter 2008
 
 , diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30, an increase over the $3.05 to $3.20 range previously provided. This increase in 2008 diluted earnings per share guidance is primarily due to the better than anticipated results during second quarter 2008 and share repurchases since April 30.
For the full year 2008
These outlook figures for second quarter and full year 2008 exclude nonrecurring items, any share repurchases settled after July 31, 2008, and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other similar business transactions.
 
We are pleased with the operational performance and continued share buybacks that are driving an increase in our full year 2008 outlook, said Post. We continue to evaluate deployment and technology alternatives for our 700 MHz spectrum and are currently leaning toward the same type of LTE-based deployment that has been discussed by the larger carriers.  We do not foresee material 700 MHz related effects on our capital or operating budgets in either 2008 or 2009 since LTE-based network elements and end-user devices are not expected to be commercially available until early 2010 or later.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial schedules. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Companys Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
