FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Monroe, LA and Overland Park, KS
 October 27, 2008  CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) and Embarq Corporation (NYSE: EQ) announced today that their Boards of Directors have approved a definitive agreement under which CenturyTel will acquire EMBARQ in a tax free, stock-for-stock transaction creating one of the leading communications companies in the United States.
Under the terms of the agreement, EMBARQ shareholders will receive 1.37 CenturyTel shares for each share of EMBARQ common stock they own. Based on the closing stock price for CenturyTel on October 24, 2008, this consideration would be equivalent to $40.42 of CenturyTel stock for each EMBARQ share, representing a premium to EMBARQ shareholders of approximately 36% over EMBARQ's closing stock price on October 24, 2008 and 11% over EMBARQ's average closing stock price during the past thirty calendar days. The transaction reflects an enterprise value of approximately $11.6 billion, including the assumption of $5.8 billion of EMBARQ's debt. Upon closing of the transaction, EMBARQ shareholders are expected to own approximately 66% and CenturyTel shareholders are expected to own approximately 34% of the combined company. The parties expect the transaction to be accretive to CenturyTel's free cash flow per share in 20 10, the first full year following the expected closing.
This transaction combines two leading communications companies with customer-focused, industry-leading capabilities. The two companies have a combined operating presence in 33 states with approximately eight million access lines and two million broadband customers. The combined company is expected to have pro forma revenue in excess of $8.8 billion, pro forma EBITDA of approximately $4.2 billion, pro forma leverage of 2.1 times EBITDA and pro forma free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, based on anticipated full run-rate synergies and operating results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008.
Glen F. Post III, CenturyTel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "This transaction is a significant win for the shareholders of CenturyTel and EMBARQ, as well as our respective employees, customers and the communities we serve. EMBARQ has invested in building a base of high-quality
assets positioned to create long-term value. We expect that bringing EMBARQ and CenturyTel together will accelerate both companies' strategic plans, diversify our revenues and provide us with the expanded networks, expertise and financial resources to build long-term value for shareholders. I am confident that the talent and dedication of CenturyTel and EMBARQ employees will enable us to quickly realize the significant potential inherent in this combination.
"In addition to bringing together the complementary assets, geographic coverage and outstanding employees of both companies, this combination unites two very similar corporate cultures that share a strong commitment to their customers, employees and communities. I look forward to working with the combined CenturyTel and EMBARQ team to continue providing outstanding service and enhanced offerings to our customers while delivering strong returns to all our shareholders."
Tom Gerke, EMBARQ's Chief Executive Officer, said, "In CenturyTel, we have found a terrific strategic partner, one with an outstanding history of providing quality and innovative products and services to its customers across the country. This transaction is expected to deliver immediate value to our shareholders and provide significant growth potential via a combined company that is better positioned to compete and win in an increasingly competitive marketplace. We are looking forward to joining with a partner who shares our commitment to customers, employees and the communities we serve."
"Shareholders and consumers alike should be excited by the potential benefits this combined company will bring to the marketplace," said William A. Owens, current non-executive Chairman of EMBARQ's Board and future non-executive Chairman of the combined company. "This merger will join together two industry leaders in their own right to create a dynamic new competitor in the communications industry."
Benefits of the Transaction
Enhanced Competitive Position:
The combined company is expected to be even more
competitive, with significantly increased scale to facilitate economically attractive deployment of
growth products and services including expanded IPTV, broadband and wireless data offers. The
two companies have a combined operating presence in 33 states with approximately eight million
access lines, two million broadband customers and approximately 400,000 video subscribers.
Significant Synergy Opportunities:
The transaction is expected to generate synergies of
approximately $400 million annually within the first three years of operation. Key drivers of
these synergies include reduction of corporate overhead, elimination of duplicate functions,
enhanced revenue opportunities and increased operational efficiencies through the adoption of
best practices and capabilities from each company.
Financial Strength and Flexibility:
CenturyTel expects the transaction to be accretive to its
2010 free cash flow per share, the first full year following the expected closing. The pro forma
combined company's pro forma leverage is 2.1 times EBITDA for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2008 including synergies on a full run-rate basis. This sound capital structure is
well suited for long-term stability. It should allow ample funding for the business and the
capacity to continue returning substantial capital to shareholders going forward.
Dividend Policy, Share Repurchase Program and Pro Forma Leverage
Each company plans to continue its current dividend policy through the close of the transaction. CenturyTel has suspended its current share repurchase program pending completion of this transaction. Post closing, subject to its intention to maintain an investment grade credit rating, CenturyTel expects to continue its current dividend policy and to return a substantial portion of the combined company's free cash flow to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchase programs.
Management, Board Composition and Headquarters
The combined company's senior leadership team will be comprised of executives from both CenturyTel and EMBARQ. Glen Post will be Chief Executive Officer, Tom Gerke will assume the role of executive Vice-Chairman of the Board, Karen Puckett will be Chief Operating Officer and Stewart Ewing will serve as Chief Financial Officer.
William A. Owens, currently non-executive Chairman of the EMBARQ Board of Directors, will be the non-executive Chairman of the combined company and Harvey Perry will continue as non-executive Vice-Chairman.
Following the closing of the transaction, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be composed of eight current CenturyTel Board members and seven members from the current EMBARQ Board.
Corporate headquarters will be in Monroe, Louisiana. The combined company will also maintain a significant presence in Overland Park, Kansas.
The name of the combined company will be determined prior to the close of the transaction.
Approvals and Timing
The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act as well as approvals from the Federal Communications Commission, certain state public service commissions and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyTel and EMBARQ shareholders. The companies anticipate closing this transaction in the second quarter of 2009.
CenturyTel has received commitments from Bank of America, Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to refinance EMBARQ's bank debt at closing.
