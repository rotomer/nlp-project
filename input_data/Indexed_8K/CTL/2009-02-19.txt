CenturyTel Reports Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings
Monroe, La... CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2008.
 
 
 
 
excluding nonrecurring items, declined 2.3% to $642.6 million in fourth quarter 2008 from $657.8 million in fourth quarter 2007. Revenue increases during the quarter of approximately $17 million resulted primarily from growth associated with the 15.5% increase in high-speed Internet customers. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines of approximately $32 million primarily attributable to previously anticipated access line losses and lower access revenues.
      ,
Operating revenues
, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 3.0% to $459.5 million from $473.9 million in fourth quarter 2007 as lower cash expenses and lower depreciation expense due to fully depreciated assets more than offset increased costs associated with the growth in high-speed Internet customers.
     
Operating expenses
      We experienced solid demand for broadband services during 2008 as high-speed Internet customers increased by more than 15% year over year, Post said. We are also pleased with our business customers rapid adoption of high bandwidth Ethernet services.
, excluding nonrecurring items, for fourth quarter 2008 declined 3.0% to $311.9 million from $321.5 million in fourth quarter 2007. CenturyTel achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 48.5% during the quarter versus 48.9% in fourth quarter 2007.
     
Operating cash flow
 
, excluding nonrecurring items, of $5.5 million for fourth quarter 2008 was $2.9 million lower than during fourth quarter 2007 primarily due to favorable 2006 audit adjustments recorded in fourth quarter 2007 related to a cellular partnership in which we own a 49% interest.
     
Other income
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $87.0 million, a 3.1% decrease from $89.8 million in fourth quarter 2007. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 7.3% to $.88 in fourth quarter 2008 compared to $.82 in fourth quarter 2007 due to the items discussed above and the reduction in diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases.
     
Net income
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, were $2.598 billion compared to $2.606 billion in 2007, a 0.3% decrease. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.258 billion for 2008 compared to $1.292 billion for 2007. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $347.1 million compared to $354.3 million in 2007, while diluted earnings per share was $3.37 compared to $3.16 in 2007.
     
For the year 2008
income for fourth quarter 2008 was $100.1 million compared to $115.0 million for fourth quarter 2007. Diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in fourth quarter 2008 compared to $1.04 in fourth quarter 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 results reflect a $12.8 million tax benefit due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 and a $6.3 million after-tax benefit primarily related to the recognition of previously accrued transaction related and other contingencies.  Such favorable items were partially offset by an after-tax charge of $1.1 million due to severance and related costs due to a workforce reduction and an after-tax charge of $5.0 million related to costs associated with the pending acquisition of EMBARQ. Fourth quarter 2007 results reflect an after-tax benefit of $1.8 million related to hurricane-related insurance reimbursements, an after-tax benefit of $2.4 million related to the liquidation of Rural Telephone Bank stock, and a $32.7 million tax benefit due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, which were partially offset by $12.2 million of after-tax impairment charges associated with certain operating and non-operating investments described further in the attached financial schedules.
     
 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (
GAAP),
net
Under GAAP, for the year 2008, the Company reported net income of $365.7 million, or $3.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $418.4 million, or $3.72 per diluted share, for the year 2007. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2008 and 2007.
 
  The following 2009 outlook discussion is for CenturyTel only and does not include any benefit or impact of the pending acquisition of EMBARQ. Acquisition-related costs incurred by CenturyTel in 2009 are considered nonrecurring items and are also not included in these 2009 outlooks.
      .
Outlook for 2009
 
Based on current conditions, for full year 2009, CenturyTel anticipates operating revenues to be modestly lower than 2008 operating revenues. The Company expects revenue increases associated with growth in high-speed Internet and data revenues to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced universal service funding and access line losses.
 
For full year 2009, CenturyTel anticipates diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30. Thefollowing items are expected to have a positive impact on 2009 diluted earnings per share:
 
The following items are expected to negatively impact 2009 diluted earnings per share:
For first quarter 2009, CenturyTel expects total revenues of $628 to $638 million and diluted earnings per share of $.77 to $.81.
 
Finally, the Company currently expects its capital expenditures in 2009, excluding any EMBARQ-related acquisition, integration or post-closing capital expenditures, to be between $280 and $300 million, in line with 2008 capital expenditures of $287 million.
These 2009 outlook figures exclude the effects of nonrecurring items, any share repurchases made after December 31, 2008, the pending EMBARQ acquisition and any changes in operating or capital plans related thereto, and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions.
We expect to update our outlook after completing the EMBARQ acquisition. We currently expect to close the transaction during second quarter 2009, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions.
 
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial schedules. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Companys Web site at www.centurytel.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
