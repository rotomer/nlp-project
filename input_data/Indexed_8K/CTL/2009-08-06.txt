NEWS RELEASE
 
CenturyLink Reports Second Quarter 2009 Earnings
 
MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink (CenturyTel, Inc., NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for second quarter 2009. In connection with the July 1, 2009 merger with Embarq Corporation, CenturyTel began operating under the tradename CenturyLink. Unless otherwise noted herein, the second quarter results discussed in this news release relate solely to legacy CenturyTel, Inc.
 
 
 
 
 
Our employees did an excellent job of remaining focused on serving our customers while working to complete the EMBARQ acquisition and plan for a successful integration, Glen F. Post, III, chief executive officer and president, said. We will continue to focus on increasing our long-term cash flows by driving operating efficiencies and providing compelling product and service bundles to our customers
.
 
excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 3.4% to $634.5 million in second quarter 2009 compared to $657.1 million in second quarter 2008. Revenue increases of approximately $17 million were driven primarily by growth in high-speed Internet customers and higher fiber transport revenues. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines of approximately $39 million primarily attributable to lower access revenues, lower universal service fund receipts and access line losses.
Operating revenues,
 
excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 2.2% to $459.4 million from $469.8 million in second quarter 2008, primarily due to lower access expense, marketing costs and depreciation expense that more than offset increased operating costs associated with growth in high-speed Internet customers.
Operating expenses
,
 
We continue to experience good demand from our business customers for high bandwidth transport and Ethernet services in spite of the challenging economy, Post said. Additionally, the demand for broadband services from our residential and small business customers remained solid as we added more than 16,000 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter and our consumer penetration reached 44%.
 
excluding nonrecurring items, for second quarter 2009 decreased 4.6% to $303.6 million from $318.3 million in second quarter 2008. CenturyLink achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding nonrecurring items, of 47.8% during the quarter versus 48.4% in second quarter 2008.
Operating cash flow
,
, excluding nonrecurring items, was $83.3 million, an 8.6% decrease from $91.2 million in second quarter 2008. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, declined 4.6% to $.83 in second quarter 2009 compared to $.87 in second quarter 2008, primarily due to lower operating income, which was partially offset by lower interest expense and the 4.4% reduction in diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases in 2008.
Net income
, operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, were $1.270 billion compared to $1.306 billion during the same period in 2008, a 2.7% decrease. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $609.1 million for the first six months of 2009, a 4.4% decrease from the $637.4 million during the same period a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 6.8% to $165.2 million from $177.3 million in 2009, while diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 1.8% to $1.64 from $1.67 in 2008.
For the first six months of 2009
, net income for second quarter 2009 was $69.0 million compared to $92.2 million for second quarter 2008. Diluted earnings per share was $.68 in second quarter 2009 compared to $.88 in second quarter 2008. Second quarter 2009 results include after-tax charges of $16.3 million related to the EMBARQ integration and a legal settlement which were partially offset by a $2.0 million after-tax favorable impact due to the resolution of transaction tax audit issues. Second quarter 2008 results include a net $1.3 million after-tax charge related to the freeze of our supplemental executive pension plan and a net $2.3 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of certain income tax audit issues.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
             For the first six months of 2009, under GAAP, the Company reported net income of $136.2 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to net income of $180.9 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2008. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the years 2009 and 2008.
 
The completion of the EMBARQ transaction positions CenturyLink as a premier communications provider that is financially stronger, more competitive and a leading broadband provider in our markets across 33 states, Post said. This merger brings together complementary assets, increased geographic coverage and outstanding employees capable of delivering a broader range of products and services to our customers.
 
For third quarter 2009,CenturyLink expects total operating revenues of $1.85 to $1.89 billion and diluted earnings per share of $.78 to $.82. This increase in revenues compared to second quarter 2009 guidance is primarily due to the EMBARQ acquisition which closed July 1, 2009. For the full year 2009, the Company continues to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30. CenturyLink expects capital expenditures to be $525 to $575 million for the last six months of 2009, which includes capital expenditures for the EMBARQ properties, but excludes one-time capital expenditures associated with the EMBARQ integration. These outlook figures exclude the effects of all nonrecurring items including any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other similar business transactions. These outlook figures for third quarter also exclude nonrecurring items relating to the EMBARQ merger, including approximately $135 million of transaction and integration costs, based on current plans and available information.
Outlook
.
 
 
The Companys elective filing in September 2008 to operate a majority of its properties under price cap regulation at the interstate level was granted by the Federal Communications Commission and became effective July 1, 2009. As a result, on July 1, 2009, the Company discontinued accounting for certain regulated operating entities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 (SFAS 71). Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we expect operating revenues and expenses to decrease approximately $60 to $70 million, during each of the next two quarters, primarily due to the elimination of inter-company transactions.
           Additionally, as a result of the discontinuance of SFAS 71 and purchase accounting adjustments related to the EMBARQ merger, we expect, based on current estimates and information, quarterly results for each of the next two quarters to be negatively impacted by:
 
These above amounts are subject to change upon finalization of the impact of discontinuing SFAS 71 and the purchase price allocation process. Additional information about the expected impact of the discontinuance of SFAS 71 and the EMBARQ acquisition on our business, future operating results and financial position will be contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, which we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2009.
Theacquisition of Embarq Corporation was effective July 1, 2009. To assist the investment community in tracking EMBARQs financial and operating trends, the Company is providing, separate from CenturyTels reported results, selected second quarter 2009 EMBARQ consolidated financial and subscriber information.
EMBARQ Results
.
 
For second quarter 2009, EMBARQs operating revenues were $1.325 billion, a 7.9% decline from $1.439 billion in second quarter 2008, and its operating cash flow was $664 million, in line with the $670 million in second quarter 2008. EMBARQs operating cash flow margin for second quarter 2009 was 50.1%, a 7.5% increase over the 46.6% operating cash flow margin in second quarter 2008. EMBARQ experienced more than a $30 million decrease in total operating expenses in second quarter 2009 compared to first quarter 2009, primarily due to approximately $15 million of favorable one-time items, along with lower bad debt and marketing expenses. Operating expenses in EMBARQ markets are expected to return to more normal run rate levels in the third quarter.
Operating income for second quarter 2009 was $420 million, in line with the $424 million for the same period in 2008. Operating income margin was 31.7% for second quarter 2009 versus 29.5% in the year earlier quarter. EMBARQ generated income from continuing operations of $204 million in the second quarter, in line with the $202 million for second quarter 2008.
EMBARQ added approximately 12,200 high-speed Internet subscribers during second quarter 2009 and served approximately 1.465 million high-speed Internet subscribers as of June 30, 2009. EMBARQ ended the quarter with approximately 5.389 million access lines in service, experiencing access line losses of 163,000 lines during the second quarter.
EMBARQ invested approximately $147 million in capital investments during second quarter 2009 and generated free cash flow (defined as income from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures) of more than $300 million for the quarter.
           These results are included in a supplemental schedule attached hereto and are also available on the Companys
investor relations Web site at ir.centurytel.com.
 
CenturyLink now expects to realize approximately $475 million in synergies versus the $400 million originally anticipated. The Company continues to expect to complete conversion of EMBARQs enterprise resource management systems and the initial billing conversion in fourth quarter 2009. The Companys current estimate of post-closing integration costs is approximately $370 million.
Integration Update
.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow, operating income and cash flow margins, and adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items.
