CenturyLink Reports Third Quarter Earnings
MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink (CenturyTel, Inc., NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for third quarter 2009, which include the effect of the Embarq acquisition completed July 1, 2009.
 
 
 
CenturyLink achieved solid results in the third quarter reflecting the contribution of the Embarq acquisition to our operations, Glen F. Post, III, chief executive officer and president, said. We completed the financial and human resource systems conversions, launched our new CenturyLink brand across all our markets in 33 states and completed our initial billing conversion in October. We are off to an excellent start with this strategic combination that we believe positions CenturyLink well and to
to drive long-term shareholder value
provide our customers expanded products and reliable services.
 
for third quarter 2009 were $1.874 billion compared to $650.1 million in third quarter 2008. This increase was primarily due to $1.299 billion of revenue contribution from the Embarq acquisition completed July 1, 2009. Additionally, revenue increases primarily driven by growth in high-speed Internet customers and favorable prior period revenue settlements were more than offset by revenue declines primarily due to the impact of access line losses and lower access revenues, along with the elimination of $53 million of revenues associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities during third quarter 2009.
Operating revenues
, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 178.4% to $1.307 billion from $469.3 million in third quarter 2008, primarily due to $922 million of operating costs associated with the Embarq acquisition which more than offset the reduction in operating expenses associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting during third quarter 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $34 million lower in third quarter 2009 compared to amounts previously forecast at the end of second quarter 2009 due to adjustments to reflect the preliminary assignment of fair value and depreciable life to Embarqs property and intangible assets. Such fair value assignment has not been finalized at this time.
Operating expenses
, excluding nonrecurring items,increased 200.8% to $929.8 million from $309.1 million in third quarter 2008, primarily due to the Embarq acquisition. For third quarter 2009, CenturyLink achieved an operating cash flow margin of 49.6% versus 47.5% in third quarter 2008.
Operating cash flow
 
We successfully implemented our region operating model and launched an aggressive broadband strategy across all markets immediately following the close of the Embarq transaction, Post said. These initiatives, along with our continued focus on owning the broadband position in our markets, resulted in the addition of more than 43,500 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter.
,excluding nonrecurring items, was $269.1 million in third quarter 2009 compared to $82.8 million in third quarter 2008, primarily driven by the Embarq acquisition. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.90 for third quarter 2009, an 11.1% increase from the $.81 reported in third quarter 2008. This increase was primarily due to the higher net income as discussed above, partially offset by the 196.5% increase in average diluted shares outstanding as a result of our all-stock acquisition of Embarq.
Net income
 
,operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 60.8% to $3.144 billion from $1.956 billion for the same period in 2008. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $1.539 billion for the first nine months of 2009 compared to $946.5 million a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $434.2 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $260.1 million during the same period in 2008. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $2.60 during the first nine months of 2009 compared to $2.48 in the first nine months of 2008.
For the first nine months of 2009
 
, net income for third quarter 2009 was $280.8 million compared to $84.7 million for third quarter 2008 and, diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2009 was $.94 compared to $.83 for third quarter 2008. Third quarter 2009 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect after-tax costs associated with the Embarq acquisition of $127.5 million ($.43 per share) that were more than offset by a net after-tax benefit of $133.2 million ($.44 per share) attributable to the extraordinary gain recognized upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and an after-tax benefit of $6.1 million ($.02 per share) related to the favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues. Third quarter 2008 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect a net after-tax benefit of $2.0 million ($.02 per share) from the sale of a non-core asset.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 
Net income under GAAP for the first nine months of 2009 was $417.0 million compared to $265.7 million for the first nine months of 2008 and, diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2009 was $2.50 compared to $2.53 for the first nine months of 2008. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008.
  For fourth quarter 2009, CenturyLink expects total operating revenues of $1.81 to $1.85 billion and diluted earnings per share of $.84 to $.88. The Company has also increased and narrowed the range of anticipated full year 2009 diluted earnings per share guidance from a range of $3.20 to $3.30 to a range of $3.45 to $3.50.
Outlook.
Third quarter 2009 and fourth quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share each reflect an approximately $.07 per share favorable impact from lower depreciation expense than previously forecast at the end of second quarter 2009 due to adjustments to the preliminary assignment of fair value and depreciable life to Embarqs property and intangible assets. Such fair value assignment has not been finalized at this time. Depreciation and amortization may change significantly from amounts reported herein upon finalization of the purchase price allocation process, which we expect to occur during fourth quarter 2009.
 
In addition to synergies that CenturyLink expects to realize in 2010, the Company has identified the following items that can be expected to negatively impact 2010 results when compared to 2009. First, the Company expects Universal Service Fund receipts to decline. Secondly, a wireless carrier has notified CenturyLink of its intention to migrate a portion of its network traffic from the Company in 2010. The Company expects these items will negatively impact 2010 diluted earnings per share by $.12 to $.15. CenturyLink expects to provide full year 2010 earnings per share guidance in conjunction with its fourth quarter 2009 earnings release.
All outlook figures provided under this section are presented excluding nonrecurring merger integration costs, the potential impact of any future mergers, acquisitions or divestitures, or other nonrecurring events.
CenturyLink incurred $195.5 million of integration, transaction and other costs related to the Embarq acquisition during third quarter 2009. This amount was approximately $60 million higher than originally expected primarily due to earlier than anticipated recognition of severance costs and additional benefits costs recognized due to change of control provisions. The Company also incurred approximately $27.1 million of integration-related capital expenditures.
Integration Update.
CenturyLink achieved approximately $14 million in operating cost synergies during third quarter 2009 and expects to realize additional incremental operating cost synergies of approximately $12 million in fourth quarter 2009.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items and certain pro forma combined operating results. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial schedules. Reconciliation of additional non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the earnings call described below will be available in the Investor Relations portion of the Companys Web site at www.centurylink.com. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation to GAAP.
