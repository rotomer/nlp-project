CenturyLink Reports Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings
MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink (CenturyTel, Inc., NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for fourth quarter 2009, which include the effect of the Embarq acquisition completed July 1, 2009.
 
 
CenturyLink continued to make solid progress with the Embarq integration and the implementation of our local-focused regional operating model as access line loss improved to an 8.6% annualized rate in the second half of 2009 compared to a 9.8% pro forma annualized rate in the second half of 2008, Glen F. Post, III, chief executive officer and president, said. Our launch of enhanced product offerings, targeted marketing campaigns and focus on achieving synergies from the Embarq acquisition helped CenturyLink achieve solid fourth quarter financial results
.
 
, excluding nonrecurring items, for fourth quarter 2009 were $1.839 billion compared to $642.6 million in fourth quarter 2008. This increase was primarily due to $1.266 billion of revenue contribution from the Embarq acquisition completed July 1, 2009. Additionally, revenue increases primarily driven by growth in high-speed Internet customers and favorable prior period revenue settlements were more than offset by revenue declines primarily due to the impact of access line losses and lower access revenues, along with the elimination of $54.5 million of revenues associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting for certain regulated operating entities reflected in fourth quarter 2009.
Operating revenues
, excluding nonrecurring items, were $1.252 billion compared to $459.5 million in fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to $855.8 million of operating costs associated with the Embarq acquisition which more than offset the reduction in operating expenses associated with the discontinuance of regulatory accounting reflected in fourth quarter 2009.
Operating expenses
, excluding nonrecurring items,increased 202.5% to $943.6 million from $311.9 million in fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to the Embarq acquisition. For fourth quarter 2009, CenturyLink achieved an operating cash flow margin of 51.3% versus 48.5% in fourth quarter 2008.
Operating cash flow
 
 
We continue to see strong customer demand for broadband services, including high-speed Internet and Ethernet services, as we added nearly 47,000 high-speed Internet customers during the fourth quarter, Post said. Based on 2009 pro forma financials, CenturyLink generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flow for full year 2009.
 
,excluding nonrecurring items, was $286.7 million in fourth quarter 2009 compared to $87.0 million in fourth quarter 2008, primarily driven by the Embarq acquisition. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.95 for fourth quarter 2009, a 9.2% increase from the $.87 reported in fourth quarter 2008. This increase was primarily due to the higher net income as discussed above, partially offset by the 202.5% increase in average diluted shares outstanding as a result of our all-stock acquisition of Embarq.
Net income
 
,operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 91.4% to $4.973 billion from $2.598 billion for the same period in 2008. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $2.483 billion for 2009 compared to $1.258 billion in 2008. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $720.9 million compared to $347.1 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $3.60 compared to $3.35 in 2008.
For the year 2009
 
, net income for fourth quarter 2009 was $230.2 million compared to $100.1 million for fourth quarter 2008, and diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2009 was $.77 compared to $1.00 for fourth quarter 2008.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
Fourth quarter 2009 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect after-tax costs of $37.8 million ($.13 per share) associated with debt extinguishments, $19.8 million ($.07 per share) related to integration costs associated with the Embarq acquisition, $5.0 million ($.02 per share) related to a litigation settlement, and $4.4 million ($.01 per share) associated with severance related costs and the accelerated recognition of share-based compensation and pension expense. These after-tax costs more than offset a $10.7 million ($.04 per share) net tax benefit related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities related to the Embarq acquisition.
Fourth quarter 2008 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect a $12.8 million tax benefit due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and a $6.3 million after-tax benefit primarily related to the recognition of previously accrued transaction-related and other contingencies.  Such favorable items were partially offset by an after-tax charge of $1.1 million due to severance and related costs due to a workforce reduction and an after-tax charge of $5.0 million related to costs associated with the acquisition of Embarq.
Net income under GAAP for full year 2009 was $647.2 million compared to $365.7 million for full year 2008 and diluted earnings per share for full year 2009 was $3.23 compared to $3.52 for full year 2008. See the accompanying financial schedules for detail of the Companys nonrecurring items for full year 2009 and 2008.
As noted in a separate press release issued today,CenturyLinks Board of Directors voted to declare a quarterly cash dividend of $.725 per share, representing a 3.6% dividend increase.
Dividend Increase
.
 
 
CenturyLink remains committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet and delivering long-term shareholder value. We believe this dividend increase is reflective of our continued strong free cash flow and achieves an appropriate balance of returning cash to shareholders while maintaining a solid credit profile, said Post.
 
For full year 2010, CenturyLink expects operating revenues, excluding certain unusual items, to be 5.5% to 6.5% lower than 2009 pro forma operating revenues as revenue increases associated with growth in high-speed Internet are expected to be more than offset by revenue declines associated with lower access revenues, reduced universal service funding, access line losses and other items. Giving effect to these unusual items, which approximate $135 to $145 million of revenue reductions, 2010 operating revenues are expected to decline 7.5% to 8.5% compared to pro forma 2009. We expect the additional revenue decline in 2011 associated with these unusual items to be approximately $30 million. Additionally, approximately $75 to $80 million of these unusual items is not expected to affect 2010 operating cash flow because of direct offsetting expense reductions.
Outlook for 2010
.
Free cash flow for full year 2010 is anticipated to be $1.475 to $1.525 billion, reflecting a dividend payout ratio of 57% to 59%.  The Company currently expects 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 and $875 million, or approximately 15% lower than 2009 pro forma capital expenditures of $1.0 billion.
 
For full year 2010, CenturyLink anticipates diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20. The following items are expected to have a positive impact on 2010 diluted earnings per share:
Additionally, CenturyLink expects to make a voluntary pre-tax $300 million contribution to one of its pension plans during first quarter 2010.
 
See the attached supplemental schedule for pro forma 2009 information.
For first quarter 2010, CenturyLink expects total revenues of $1.77 to $1.80 billion and diluted earnings per share of $.84 to $.88.
These 2010 outlook figures exclude the effects of nonrecurring items, future changes in regulation, integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, any changes in operating or capital plans related thereto, and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions.
 
CenturyLink incurred $39 million of integration and other costs related to the Embarq acquisition during fourth quarter 2009. The Company also incurred approximately $28 million of integration-related capital expenditures during the fourth quarter.
Integration Update.
CenturyLink achieved approximately $40 million in operating cost synergies during fourth quarter 2009 and expects to realize additional incremental operating cost synergies of approximately $10 million in first quarter 2010 and approximately $200 million in incremental synergies for full year 2010 compared to the level of synergies recognized in 2009.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items and certain pro forma combined operating results. In addition to providing key metrics for management to evaluate the Companys performance, we believe these measurements assist investors in their understanding of period-to-period operating performance and in identifying historical and prospective trends.
