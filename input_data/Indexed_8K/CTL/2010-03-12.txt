Time-Vested Restricted Stock
 
 
For each Named Executive Officer, these shares of time-vested restricted stock will vest in three equal installments on March 15 of 2011, 2012, and 2013, subject to the Named Executive Officers continued employment.  These shares may also vest upon certain terminations of employment or a change of control of the Company, to be described in greater detail in the form of Restricted Stock Agreement that the Company intends to file as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010.  In addition, these grants of restricted stock are subject to the terms of the Plan, which is included as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
.  Section 10 of the Plan permits the Compensation Committee to make the vesting, grant, or payment of certain types of awards contingent upon the achievement of one or more of the following performance goals: return on equity, cash flow, assets or investment; shareholder return; changes in revenues, operating income, cash flow, cash provided by operating activities, earnings or earnings per share; customer growth; customer satisfaction or an economic value added measure.  These goals may be applied to the Company or one or more of its divisions, subsidiaries or lines of business, and may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or industry benchmarks, or relative to levels attained in prior years.
Performance-Vested Restricted Stock
 
For 2010, in addition to their above-described time-vested restricted stock grants and consistent with the Plans provisions regarding performance-based compensation, the Named Executive Officers received the following grants of performance-vested restricted stock, which will vest over time only if specific performance measures are met for the applicable periods (the ):
Performance-Vested Restricted Shares
 
 
 
For each Named Executive Officer, half of the Performance-Vested Restricted Shares will vest on March 15, 2012, based on the Companys two-year total shareholder return for 2010 and 2011 as measured against the total shareholder return of the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index for the same period.  The other half will vest on March 15, 2013, based on the Companys three-year total shareholder return for 2010, 2011, and 2012, as measured against total shareholder return of the S&P 500 companies for the same period.
 
The above-listed number of Performance-Vested Restricted Shares granted to each Named Executive Officer represents the target award.  Each Named Executive Officer has the opportunity to receive a greater or lesser number of shares depending on the Companys total shareholder return in relation to that of the S&P 500 companies, as illustrated further below:

These grants of Performance Shares are also subject to the terms of the Plan, which is included as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference.
