On April 7, 2010, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to Article IV, Section 8, of our Bylaws, effective immediately, to change the vote standard for the election of directors from a plurality vote to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections.  The Bylaws now require that a director nominee must receive a majority of votes cast at a meeting held for the uncontested election of directors.  In a contested election, directors would be elected by a plurality vote.  The Bylaws also now require incumbent directors who do not receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election to tender their resignation to the Board of Directors for its consideration.
This description of the changes to our Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, as amended through April 7, 2010, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
(d)           The exhibits to this current report on Form 8-K are listed in the Exhibit Index, which appears at the end of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this current report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board.  Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of such Directors at a meeting.
 
 
 
At all meetings of the Board, each Director present shall have one vote.  At all meetings of the Board, all questions, the manner of deciding which is not otherwise specifically regulated by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, shall be determined by a majority of the Directors present at the meeting, provided, however, that any shares of other corporations owned by the Corporation shall be voted only pursuant to resolutions duly adopted upon the affirmative votes of (a) 80% of the Directors then in office and (b) a majority of the Continuing Directors, voting as a separate group.
 
 
 
Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held by means of telephone conference calls or similar communications equipment provided that all persons participating in the meeting can hear and communicate with each other.

Definitions
.
 
(a)           The term Change of Control shall mean (i) an acquisition by any person (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or l4(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding voting securities; (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Corporation and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Corporation's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; or (iii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation involving the Corporation if the shareholders of the Corporation, immediately before such merger or consolidation, do not own, immediately following such merger or consolidation, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the resulting entity in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of voting securities immediately before such merger or consolidation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because 20% or more of the Corporations then outstanding voting securities is acquired by (l) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one or more employee benefit plans maintained by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or (2) any entity that, immediately prior to such acquisition, is owned directly or indirectly by the shareholders of the Corporation in the same proportion as their ownership of shares in the Corporation immediately prior to such acquisition.
 
(b)           The term Claim shall mean any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit, or proceeding, including discovery, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative and whether made judicially or extra-judicially, or any separate issue or matter therein, as the context requires, but shall not include any action, suit or proceeding initiated by Indemnitee against the Corporation  (other than to enforce the terms of this Section), or initiated by Indemnitee against any director or officer of the Corporation unless the Corporation has joined in or consented in writing to the initiation of such action, suit or proceeding.
 
(c)           The term Determining Body shall mean (i) the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of the entire board consisting of directors who are not named as parties to the Claim for which indemnification is being sought (Disinterested Directors), or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, independent legal counsel (A) selected by the Disinterested Directors, or (B) if there are fewer than two Disinterested Directors, selected by the Board of Directors (in which selection directors who do not qualify as Disinterested Directors may participate); provided, however, that following a Change of Control, with respect to all matters thereafter arising out of acts, omissions or events occurring prior to or after the Change of Control concerning the rights of Indemnitee to seek indemnification, such determination shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Board of Directors in the manner described above in this Section 10.1(c) (which selection shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) from a panel of three counsel nominated by Indemnitee.  Such counsel shall not have otherwise performed services for the Corporation, Indemnitee or their affiliates (other than services as independent counsel in connection with similar matters) within the five years preceding its engagement ("Independent Counsel").  If Indemnitee fails to nominate Independent Counsel within ten business days following written request by the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall select Independent Counsel.  Such counsel shall not be a person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee's rights under this Section, nor shall Independent Counsel be any person who has been sanctioned or censured for ethical violations of applicable standards of professional conduct.  The Corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs of the Independent Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such Independent Counsel against any and all expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Section 10.1(c) or its engagement pursuant hereto.

(e)           The term "Disbursing Officer" shall mean, with respect to a Claim, the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or, if the Chief Executive Officer is a party to the Claim as to which advancement or indemnification is being sought, any officer who is not a party to the Claim and who is designated by the Chief Executive Officer, which designation shall be made promptly after the Corporation's receipt of Indemnitee's initial request for advancement or indemnification and communicated to Indemnitee.
 
(f)           The term Expenses shall mean any reasonable expenses or costs (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, fees of experts retained by attorneys, judgments, punitive or exemplary damages, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee with respect to a Claim, except that Expenses shall not include any amount paid in settlement of a Claim against Indemnitee (i) by or in the right of the Corporation, or (ii) that the Corporation has not approved, which approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
 
(g)           The term Indemnitee shall mean each Director and officer and each former Director and officer of the Corporation.
 
(h)           The term Section shall mean Article II, Section 10, of these Bylaws, in its entirety, unless the context otherwise provides.
 
(i)           The term Standard of Conduct shall mean conduct by an Indemnitee with respect to which a Claim is asserted that was in good faith and that Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Corporation, and, in the case of a Claim that is a criminal action or proceeding, conduct that the Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe was unlawful.  The termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet the Standard of Conduct.

10.2
Advancement of Expenses
 
(a)           Subject to Indemnitees furnishing the Corporation with a written undertaking, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled under this Section to indemnification therefor, the Corporation shall advance Expenses to Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of any Claim involving Indemnitee; provided, however, that Indemnitee will return, without interest, any such advance that remains unspent at the disposition of the Claim to which the advance related, and provided further, that advances of such Expenses by the Corporation's D&O Insurance carrier shall be treated, for purposes of this Section 10.2(a), as advances by the Corporation.  The written undertaking by Indemnitee must be an unlimited general obligation of Indemnitee but need not be secured and will be accepted by the Corporation without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make repayment.
 
(b)           Any request for advancement of Expenses shall be submitted by Indemnitee to the Disbursing Officer in writing and shall be accompanied by a written description of the Expenses for which advancement is requested.  The Disbursing Officer shall, within 20 days after receipt of Indemnitee's request for advancement, advance such Expenses unsecured, interest-free and without regard to Indemnitee's ability to make repayment, provided that if the Disbursing Officer questions the reasonableness of any such request, that officer shall promptly advance to the Indemnitee the amount deemed by that officer to be reasonable and shall forward immediately to the Determining Body a copy of the Indemnitee's request and of the Disbursing Officers response, together with a written description of that officers reasons for questioning the reasonableness of a portion of the advancement sought.  The Determining Body shall, within 20 days after receiving such a request from the Disbursing Officer, determine the reasonableness of the disputed Expenses and notify Indemnitee and the Disbursing Officer of its decision, which shall be final, subject to Indemnitees right under Section 10.4 to seek a judicial adjudication of Indemnitees rights.
 
(c)           Indemnitee's right to advancement under this Section 10.2 shall include the right to advancement of Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in a suit against the Corporation under Section 10.4 to enforce Indemnitee's rights under this Section.  Such right of advancement shall, however, be subject to Indemnitee's obligation pursuant to Indemnitees undertaking described in Section 10.2(a) to repay such advances, to the extent provided in Section 10.4, if it is ultimately determined in the enforcement suit that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification for a Claim.
 
 
(a)           The Corporation shall, in the manner provided in this Section, indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against Expenses incurred in connection with any Claim against Indemnitee (whether as a subject of or party to, or a proposed or threatened subject of or party to, the Claim) or in which Indemnitee is involved solely as a witness or person required to give evidence, by reason of Indemnitees position (a) as a director or officer of the Corporation, (b) as a director or officer of any subsidiary of the Corporation or as a fiduciary with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Corporation, or (c) as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other for profit or not for profit entity or enterprise, if such position is or was held at the request of the Corporation, regardless of when serving in such position occurred, if (x) Indemnitee is successful in defense of the Claim on the merits or otherwise, as provided in Section 10.3(d), or (y) Indemnitee has been found by the Determining Body to have met the Standard of Conduct; provided that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any Claim by or in the right of the Corporation as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent, a court shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such Expenses as the court shall deem proper, and provided further, that Expenses incurred in connection with a Claim for which Indemnitee has been reimbursed or indemnified by the Corporations D&O Insurance carrier shall be credited against the Corporations obligation under this Section 10.3(a) with respect to such Claim.
 
(b)           Promptly upon becoming aware of the existence of any Claim with respect to which Indemnitee may seek indemnification hereunder, Indemnitee shall notify the Chief Executive Officer (or, if the Chief Executive Officer is the Indemnitee, the next ranking executive officer who is not an Indemnitee with respect to the Claim) of the existence of the Claim, who shall promptly advise the Board of Directors that establishing the Determining Body will be a matter presented at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors.  Delay by Indemnitee in giving such notice shall not excuse performance by the Corporation hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, the Corporation did not otherwise learn of the Claim and such failure results in forfeiture by the Corporation of substantial defenses, rights or insurance coverage.  After the Determining Body has been established, the Chief Executive Officer or that officers delegate shall inform Indemnitee thereof and Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Determining Body, to the extent requested by it, of all facts relevant to the Claim known to Indemnitee.
 
(c)           Indemnitee shall be entitled to conduct the defense of the Claim and to make all decisions with respect thereto, with counsel of Indemnitees choice, provided that in the event the defense of the Claim has been assumed by the Corporation through its D&O Insurance carrier or otherwise, then (i) Indemnitee will be entitled to retain separate counsel from the Corporations Counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel at the Corporations expense if, but only if, Indemnitee shall reasonably conclude that one or more legal defenses may be available to Indemnitee that are different from, or in addition to, those available to the Corporation or other defendants represented by the Corporation through its D&O Insurance carrier or otherwise, and (ii) the Corporation will not, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, effect any settlement of the Claim unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability that is the subject matter of such Claim, (y) does not impose penalties or post-settlement obligations on Indemnitee (except for customary confidentiality obligations), and (z) does not require payment by Indemnitee of money in settlement.
 
(d)           To the extent Indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Claim, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against Expenses incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the Claim, regardless of whether Indemnitee has met the Standard of Conduct, and without the necessity of any determination by the Determining Body as to whether Indemnitee has met the Standard of Conduct.  In the event Indemnitee is not entirely successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Claim, but is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any claim, issue or matter involved in the Claim, Indemnitee shall be indemnified for the portion of Indemnitees Expenses incurred in such successful defense that is determined by the Determining Body to be reasonably and properly allocable to the claims, issues, or matters as to which Indemnitee was successful.
 
(e)           Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.3(d), the Corporation shall not indemnify any Indemnitee under Section 10.3(a) unless a determination has been made by the Determining Body (or by a court upon application or in a proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 10.4) with respect to a specific Claim that indemnification of Indemnitee is permissible because Indemnitee has met the Standard of Conduct.  In the event settlement of a Claim to which Indemnitee is a party has been proposed (Proposed Settlement), the Determining Body shall, promptly after submission to it but prior to consummation of the Proposed Settlement, make a determination whether Indemnitee shall have met the Standard of Conduct.  In the event such determination is adverse to Indemnitee, Indemnitee shall be entitled to reject the Proposed Settlement.  In the event of final disposition of a Claim other than by settlement, the Determining Body shall, promptly after but not before such final disposition, make a determination whether Indemnitee has met the Standard of Conduct.  In all cases, the determination shall be in writing and shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis and reasons therefor.  The Determining Body shall, promptly after making such determination, provide a copy thereof to both the Disbursing Officer and Indemnitee and shall instruct the former to (i) reimburse Indemnitee as soon as practicable for all Expenses, if any, to which Indemnitee has been so determined to be entitled and which have not previously been advanced to Indemnitee under Section 10.2 (or otherwise recovered by Indemnitee through an insurance or other arrangement provided by the Corporation), and (ii) seek reimbursement from Indemnitee (subject to Indemnitee's rights under Section 10.4) of all advancements that have been made pursuant to Section 10.2 as to which it has been so determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
 
(f)          Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Determining Body at the expense of the Corporation by providing to the Determining Body, upon reasonable advance request, any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to make such determination.
 
(g           If the Determining Body makes a determination pursuant to Section 10.3(e) that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation shall be bound by that determination in any judicial proceeding, absent a determination by a court that such indemnification contravenes applicable law.
 
(h)           In making a determination under Section 10.3(e), the Determining Body shall presume that the Standard of Conduct has been met unless the contrary shall be shown by a preponderance of the evidence.
 
(i)           The Corporation and Indemnitee shall keep confidential, to the extent permitted by law and their fiduciary obligations, all facts and determinations provided pursuant to or arising out of the operation of this Section, and the Corporation and Indemnitee shall instruct their respective agents to do likewise.
 
10.4           
Enforcement
.
 
(a)           The rights provided by this Section shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
(b)           If Indemnitee seeks a judicial adjudication of Indemnitees rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Section, Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the Corporation, and shall be indemnified by the Corporation against, any and all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding, but only if Indemnitee prevails therein.  If it shall be determined that Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the relief sought, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding if the indemnification amount to which Indemnitee is determined to be entitled exceeds 50% of the amount of Indemnitees claim.  Otherwise, the reimbursement of Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication shall be appropriately prorated.
 
(c)           In any judicial proceeding described in this Section 10.4, the Corporation shall bear the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to advancement or reimbursement of Expenses sought with respect to any Claim.
 
10.5             If any provision of this Section is determined by a court having jurisdiction over the matter to require the Corporation to do or refrain from doing any act that is in violation of applicable law, the court shall be empowered to modify or reform such provision so that, as modified or reformed, such provision provides the maximum indemnification permitted by law and such provision, as so modified or reformed, and the balance of this Section, shall be applied in accordance with their terms.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any portion of this Section shall be invalidated on any ground, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Section that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by law with respect to that portion that has been invalidated.
Saving Clause
.
 
10.6             The indemnification and payment of Expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee is or may become entitled under any statute, article of incorporation, insurance policy, authorization of shareholders or directors, agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any rights authorized by the Determining Body in its discretion with respect to matters for which indemnification is permitted under La. R.S. 12:83A.  The parties recognize that La. R. S. 12:83E presently provides that no such other indemnification measure shall permit indemnification of any person for the results of such person's willful or intentional misconduct.
Non-Exclusivity
.
 
10.7             In the event of any payment under this Section, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee. Following receipt of indemnification payments hereunder, as further assurance, Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and, at the expense of the Corporation, take all action reasonably necessary to secure such subrogation rights, including execution of such documents as are reasonably necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Subrogation

(b)           Indemnitees right to advancement and indemnification of Expenses pursuant to this Section shall continue regardless of the termination of Indemnitees status as a director or officer of the Corporation, and this Section shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Indemnitees personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, spouses, heirs, assigns and other successors.
 
(c)           The rights granted to each Indemnitee under this Section are personal in nature and neither the Corporation nor any Indemnitee shall, without the prior written consent of the other, assign or delegate any rights or obligations under this Section except as expressly provided in Sections 10.8(a) and 10.8(b).
 
(d)           This Section shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation), permitted, assigns, spouses, heirs, executors, administrators and personal and legal representatives.

If the Board fails to fill any such vacancy within 30 days of being advised thereof, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall have the power to fill the vacancy, in which case the new committee member shall serve on such committee until such time as the Board may elect to replace such new committee member.

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of a shareholders meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice as described above.
Required Notice
 
5.3           .  Every such notice by a shareholder shall set forth:
Contents of Notice
 
(a)           the name, age, business address and residential address of the shareholder of record who intends to make a nomination or bring up any other matter, and any beneficial owner or other person acting in concert with such shareholder;
 
(b)           a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Corporations capital stock that accord such shareholder the voting rights specified in paragraph 5.1 above and that the shareholder intends to appear in person at the meeting to make the nomination or bring up the matter specified in the notice;

Other Required Information
 
5.5           .  With respect to any proposal by a shareholder to bring before a meeting any matter other than the nomination of Directors, the following shall govern:
Disqualification of Certain Proposals
 
(a)           If the Secretary of the Corporation has received sufficient notice of a proposal that may properly be brought before the meeting, a proposal sufficient notice of which is subsequently received by the Secretary and that is substantially duplicative of the first proposal shall not be properly brought before the meeting.  If in the judgment of the Board of Directors a proposal deals with substantially the same subject matter as a prior proposal submitted to shareholders at a meeting held within the preceding five years, it shall not be properly brought before any meeting held within three years after the latest such previous submission if (i) the proposal was submitted at only one meeting during such preceding period and it received affirmative votes representing less than 3% of the total number of votes cast in regard thereto, (ii) the proposal was submitted at only two meetings during such preceding period and it received at the time of its second submission affirmative votes representing less than 6% of the total number of votes cast in regard thereto, or (iii) the proposal was submitted at three or more meetings during such preceding period and it received at the time of its latest submission affirmative votes representing less than 10% of the total number of votes cast in regard thereto.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding compliance with all of the procedures set forth above in this Section, no proposal shall be deemed to be properly brought before a meeting of shareholders if, in the judgment of the Board, it is not a proper subject for action by shareholders under Louisiana law.
 
5.6           .  At the meeting of shareholders, the chairman shall declare out of order and disregard any nomination or other matter not presented in accordance with the foregoing procedures or which is otherwise contrary to the foregoing terms and conditions.
Power to Disregard Proposals
 
5.7           .  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to modify (i) any obligations of a shareholder to comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section of the Bylaws or (ii) any rights or obligations of shareholders with respect to requesting inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy statement or soliciting their own proxies pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Rights and Obligations of Shareholders Under Federal Proxy Rules
 
5.8           .  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to modify any rights of holders of any outstanding class or series of Preferred Stock to elect Directors or bring other matters before a shareholders meeting in the manner specified by the terms and conditions governing such stock.
Rights of Preferred Shareholders
 
 
6.1           .  Except as otherwise provided by law, at all meetings of shareholders the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the Total Voting Power shall constitute a quorum to organize the meeting; that this subsection shall not have the effect of reducing the vote required to approve any matter that may be established by law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.  Shares of Voting Stock as to which the holders have voted or abstained from voting with respect to any matter considered at a meeting, or which are subject to Non-Votes (as defined in Section 6.3 below), shall be counted as present for purposes of constituting a quorum to organize a meeting.
Establishment of Quorum
provided, however,
 
6.2           .  If a quorum is present or represented at a duly organized meeting, such meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, or the refusal of any shareholders present to vote.
Withdrawal
 
6.3           .  As used in these Bylaws, Non-Votes shall mean the number of votes as to which the record holder or proxy holder of shares of Capital Stock has been precluded from voting thereon (whether by law, regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, rules or bylaws of any national securities exchange or other self-regulatory organization, or otherwise), including without limitation votes as to which brokers may not or do not exercise discretionary voting power under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange with respect to any matter for which the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the voting shares.
Non-Votes
 
 
For purposes of determining the amount of Total Voting Power present or represented at any annual or special meeting of shareholders with respect to voting on any particular matter, shares as to which the holders have abstained from voting, and shares which are subject to Non-Votes, will be treated as not present and not cast.
 
 
8.1           .  When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the Total Voting Power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law, regulation, the Articles of Incorporation or Subsection 8.2 below, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
General Voting Standard
 
8.2           .  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock and except as otherwise required by law or the Articles of Incorporation, each director to be elected by the shareholders must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to the election of that director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected in a contested election, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this section, (i) a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a directors election exceeds the number of votes cast as withheld with respect to that directors election and (ii) a contested election means that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as directors of the Corporation exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
Majority Director Election Standard
 
8.3           .  If a director nominee who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at the same meeting, the director must submit to the Board of Directors promptly after the certification of the election results a letter offering to resign from the Board of Directors (a Resignation Offer).  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the Resignation Offer and will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept the Resignation Offer, reject the Resignation Offer or take other action.  The Board of Directors, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation and any other factors they deem relevant, will act on each Resignation Offer within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results and will disclose promptly in a Form 8-K Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission its decision and the rationale therefor.
Resignation Offers
 
 
At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such shareholder and bearing a date not more than 11 months prior to the meeting, unless the instrument provides for a longer period, but in no case will an outstanding proxy be valid for longer than three years from the date of its execution.  The person appointed as proxy need not be a shareholder of the Corporation.
 
 
10.1          .  Adjournments of any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without new notice being given unless a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, but any meeting at which Directors are to be elected shall be adjourned only from day to day until such Directors shall have been elected.
Adjournments of Meetings
 
10.2          .  If a meeting cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, those present may adjourn the meeting to such time and place as they may determine, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 10.1 hereof.  In the case of any meeting called for the election of Directors, those who attend the second of such adjourned meetings, although less than a quorum as fixed in Section 6.1 hereof, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing Directors.
Lack of Quorum
 
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken only upon the vote of the shareholders, present in person or represented by duly authorized proxy, at an annual or special meeting duly noticed and called, as provided in these Bylaws, and may not be taken by a written consent of the shareholders pursuant to the Business Corporation Law of the State of Louisiana.
 
 
At every meeting of shareholders, a list of shareholders entitled to vote, arranged alphabetically and certified by the Secretary or by the agent of the Corporation having charge of transfers of shares, showing the number and class of shares held by each shareholder on the record date for the meeting, shall be produced on the request of any shareholder.
 
Section 13.            
Procedure at Shareholders Meetings
 
The Chairman of the Board,or, in his absence, the CEO, shall preside as chairman at all shareholders meetings.  The organization of each shareholders meeting and all matters relating to the manner of conducting the meeting shall be determined by the chairman, including the order of business, the conduct of discussion and the manner of voting.  Meetings shall be conducted in a manner designed to accomplish the business of the meeting in a prompt and orderly fashion and to be fair and equitable to all shareholders, but it shall not be necessary to follow Roberts Rules of Order or any other manual of parliamentary procedure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any certificates of stock issued by the Corporation shall be numbered, shall be entered into the books of the Corporation as they are issued, and shall be signed in the manner required by law.  The Corporation may elect to issue uncertificated shares of stock.
 
 
 
 
 
The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any beneficial, equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by the laws of Louisiana.
 
 
 
 
 
Any person claiming a certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed shall make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact, and the Board of Directors, the General Counsel or the Secretary may, in his or its discretion, require the owner of the lost of destroyed certificate or his legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the Board of Directors, the General Counsel or the Secretary may require, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss or destruction of any such certificate; a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to be lost or destroyed, may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the General Counsel or the Secretary, it is proper to do so.
 
 
 
 
 
All checks, drafts and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors or the executive officers  may from time to time designate.

Effective May 23, 1995, the provisions of La. R.S. 12:135 through 12:140.2 shall not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of the Corporations Capital Stock.
 
 
 
 
 
The terms Capital Stock, Continuing Directors, Total Voting Power and Voting Stock shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Articles of Incorporation, provided, however, that for purposes of Sections 3 and 6 of Article IV of these Bylaws, Total Voting Power shall mean the total number of votes that holders of Capital Stock are entitled to cast generally in the election of Directors.
 
 
 
 
 
These Bylaws may only be altered, amended or repealed in the manner specified in the Articles of Incorporation.
 
 
 

Exhibit 3.2

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board, on an annual basis, the requisite skills and characteristics of new Board members as well as the composition of the Board as a whole.  This assessment will include members independence qualifications, as well as consideration of diversity, character, judgment, skills and experience in the context of the needs of the Board at that time.

Nominees for directorship will be selected in accordance with the qualifications, criteria and procedures described in these guidelines and the Companys bylaws, as well as the policies and principles in the Committees charter and any selection guidelines or criteria adopted thereunder.  The invitation to join the Board should be extended on behalf of the full Board by the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Chairman of the Board.
 
On the terms and subject to the conditions specified in the Companys bylaws, directors shall be elected by a majority vote of the shareholders and any incumbent director failing to receive a majority of votes cast must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board.
 
The Board expects directors who change the job or responsibility they held when they were elected to the Board to volunteer to resign from the Board.  It is not the sense of the Board that in every such instance the director should necessarily leave the Board.  There should, however, be an opportunity for the Board, following a review by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, to determine the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the circumstances.
 
No director may serve on more than two other unaffiliated public company boards, unless this prohibition is waived by the Board.  No director may serve on the board of a company or organization that competes with the Company or is otherwise likely to raise a significant conflict of interest, unless such service is approved by the Board.  Directors should advise the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board.  No director may be appointed or nominated to a new term if he or she would be age 75 or older at the time of the election or appointment.
 
The Board does not believe it should establish term limits.  While term limits could help insure that there are fresh ideas and viewpoints available to the Board, they hold the disadvantage of losing the contribution of directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company and its operations and, therefore, provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole.  As an alternative to term limits, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review each directors continuation on the Board at least once every three years.  This will allow each director the opportunity to conveniently confirm his or her desire to continue as a member of the Board.
 
Annually, the Board will determine affirmatively which of its directors are independent for purposes of complying with these guidelines and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE).  A director will not be independent for these purposes unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director does not, either directly or indirectly through the directors affiliates or associates, have a material commercial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, familial or other relationship with the Company or its affiliates, other than as a director.  In making these determinations, the Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances of both the director and the directors affiliates and associates, and the extent to which any such relationship could reasonably be expected to interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by the director.  In no event, however, will a director be determined to be independent if any of the disqualifying events or conditions specified in Rule 303A.02(b) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (as such rule may from time to time be amended, restated, supplemented or re-promulgated) apply to the director.  A member of the Audit Committee of the Board will not be deemed to be independent unless such member meets the standards set forth both  in this paragraph and Rule 10A-3(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (as such rule may from time to time be amended, restated, supplemented or re-promulgated).  For purposes of this paragraph, the terms affiliates and associates will have the meanings ascribed to them in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (as such rule may from time to time be amended, restated, supplemented or re-promulgated).
 
 
The basic responsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  In discharging that obligation, directors should be entitled to rely on the honesty and integrity of the Companys senior executives and its outside advisors and auditors.  The directors shall also be entitled to have the Company purchase reasonable directors and officers liability insurance on their behalf, to the benefits of indemnification to the extent permitted by law and the Companys bylaws and any indemnification agreements, and to exculpation as provided by state law and the Companys articles of incorporation.
 
Directors are expected to (i) attend the annual shareholders meeting, (ii) attend Board meetings and meetings of committees on which they serve, and (iii) spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities.  Information and data that are important to the Boards understanding of the business to be conducted at a Board or committee meeting should generally be distributed in writing to the directors before the meeting, and directors should review these materials in advance of the meeting.
 
Each Board member is free to suggest the inclusion of items on the agenda.  Each Board member is free to raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting.  The Board will review the Companys long-term strategic plans and the principal issues that the Company will face in the future at least once a year, preferably in an off-site planning session dedicated primarily to such issues.
 
The Board believes that management speaks for the Company.  Individual Board members may, from time to time, meet or otherwise communicate with various constituencies that are involved with the Company.  However, it is expected that Board members would do this with the knowledge of the management and, absent unusual circumstances or as contemplated by the committee charters, only at the request of management.
 
If a director wishes to resign, retire or not to stand for reelection at the end of his or her current term, the director will notify the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in writing, with a copy to the Secretary.  Unless otherwise determined by the Board, when a management director retires or ceases to be an active employee for any other reason, that director will be considered to have resigned concurrently from the Board.
 
 
The Board will have at all times an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  All of the members of these committees will be independent directors, as defined in Section 1 above.
 
Committee members will be appointed by the Board upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with consideration of the desires of individual directors.  It is the sense of the Board that consideration should be given to rotating committee members periodically, but the Board does not believe that rotation should be mandated as a policy.  Any appointments or removals of committee members will be made by the Board in accordance with the Companys bylaws.
 
Each key committee will have its own charter.  The charters will set forth the purposes, goals and responsibilities of the committees as well as qualifications for committee membership, procedures for committee member appointment and removal, committee structure and operations and committee reporting to the Board.  The charters will also provide that each key committee will annually evaluate its performance.
 
The Chair of each committee, in consultation with the committee members, will determine the frequency and length of the committee meetings consistent with any requirements set forth in the committees charter.  The Chair of each committee, in consultation with members of the committee and others specified in the committees charter, will develop the committees agenda.
 
The Board and each committee have the power to hire independent legal, financial or other advisors as they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the approval of any officer of the Company in advance.
 
Each committee may meet in executive session as often as it deems appropriate, and shall have the power to obtain and review any information that the committee deems necessary to perform the functions described in its charter.
 
The Board may, from time to time, establish or maintain additional committees as necessary or appropriate.
 
 
The Board shall elect from among its members a Chairman.  The Chairman may be a director who also has executive responsibilities, including the CEO (an Executive Chair), or may be one of the Companys independent directors (a Non-Executive Chair).  The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to remain flexible with respect to whether to elect an Executive Chair or a Non-Executive Chair so that the Board may provide for succession planning and respond effectively to changes in circumstances.
 
The Chairmans responsibilities include:
 
(a)           presiding at meetings of the Board;
 
(b)           overseeing the management, development and functioning of the Board;
 
(c)           in consultation with the CEO (if different), planning and organizing the activities of the Board and the schedule for Board meetings; and
 
(d)           in consultation with the CEO (if different), establishing the agendas for Board meetings.
 
The non-management directors will meet in executive session at least quarterly in conjunction with regularly-scheduled Board meetings and will, subject to the other terms of this paragraph, elect from among the independent directors a lead outside director at least annually.  The lead outside director may call additional meetings of the non-management directors at any time.  At all times during which the Chairman is a Non-Executive Chair, all of the functions and responsibilities of the lead outside director shall be performed by the Non-Executive Chair.
 
The lead outside directors responsibilities include:
 
(a)           coordinating, developing an agenda for, and presiding at each meeting of the non-management directors; and
 
(b)           providing direction to the CEO on the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of information from management that is necessary for the non-management directors to perform their duties effectively and responsibly, with the understanding that the non-management directors will receive any information requested on their behalf by the lead outside director.
 
 
 
Directors have full and free access to officers and employees of the Company.  Any meetings or contacts that a director wishes to initiate may be arranged through the CEO or the Secretary or directly by the director.  The directors will use their judgment to ensure that any such contact is not disruptive to the business operations of the Company and will, to the extent not inappropriate, copy the CEO on any written communications between a director and an officer or employee of the Company.
 
The Board welcomes regular attendance at each Board meeting of the executive officers of the Company and such other Company personnel as the Board or the CEO may designate.
 
 
The Compensation Committee shall review annually director compensation and benefits, and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval, subject to the terms, conditions and exceptions set forth in the committees charter.  The Compensation Committee will consider whether directors independence may be jeopardized if director compensation and perquisites exceed customary levels, or if the Company makes substantial charitable contributions to organizations with which a director (or one of the directors immediate family members) is affiliated.
 
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall maintain an Orientation Program for new directors.  All new directors must participate in the Companys Orientation Program, which should be conducted as soon as practicable after new directors are elected or appointed.  This orientation may include presentations by senior management to familiarize new directors with the Companys strategic plans, its significant financial, accounting and risk management issues, its corporate compliance programs (which include its code of business conduct and ethics), its principal officers, and its internal and independent auditors.  All other directors are also invited to attend the Orientation Program.
 
The Company will also maintain a Continuing Education Program for directors, pursuant to which it will endeavor to periodically update directors on industry, technological and regulatory developments, and to provide adequate resources to support directors in understanding the Companys business and matters to be acted upon at board and committee meetings.
 
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will conduct an annual review of the CEOs performance.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will provide a report of its findings to the Board of Directors (with appropriate recusals of the CEO and other management directors, as necessary) to enable the Board to ensure that the CEO is providing the best leadership for the Company in the long- and short-term.
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should report periodically to the Board on succession planning.  The entire Board will consult periodically with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding potential successors to the CEO.  The CEO should at all times make available his or her recommendations and evaluations of potential successors, along with a review of any development plans recommended for such individuals.
 
 
The Board of Directors will conduct an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will receive comments from all directors and report annually to the Board with an assessment of the Boards performance, which will be discussed with the full Board.  The assessment will focus on the Boards contribution to the Company and specifically focus on areas in which the Board or management believes that the Board could improve.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also, no less than annually, review these guidelines and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval.
 
 
In addition to any other remedies available to the Company and subject to applicable law, if the Board or any committee of the Board determines that any bonus, incentive payment, commission, equity award or other compensation awarded to or received by an executive officer was based on any financial or operating result that was impacted by the executive officers knowing or intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct, the Board or a Board committee may recover from the executive officer the compensation it considers appropriate under the circumstances.  The Board has sole discretion to make any and all determinations under this paragraph.
 
 
The Company expects its executive officers to beneficially own CenturyLink stock equal in market value to specified multiples of their annual base salary.  For any year during which an executive does not meet his or her ownership target, the executive is expected to hold a specified percentageof the CenturyLink stock that the executive acquires through the Companys equity compensation programs, excluding shares sold to pay taxes associated with the acquisition thereof.  Each of these ownership multiples and holding percentages will be set from time to time by the Compensation Committee and will be disclosed in the Companys annual proxy statement.
 
 
Unvested restricted stock and shares held through the Companys benefit plans count towards the ownership targets, which are calculated based on trailing average stock prices and reviewed at least every three years.  Each executive officer has three years from the date they first become subject to a particular ownership level to attain that target.  The Compensation Committee administers these stock ownership guidelines, and may modify their terms and grant hardship exceptions in its discretion.
 
 
All of the Companys directors, officers and employees are required to abide by the Companys long-standing ethics and compliance policies and programs, which include standards of business conduct.  The Companys program and related procedures cover all areas of professional conduct, including employment policy, conflicts of interests, protection of confidential information, as well as strict adherence to all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of the Companys business.
 
Any waiver of the Companys policies, principles or guidelines relating to business conduct or ethics for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof, and will be promptly disclosed as required by applicable law or stock exchange regulations.
