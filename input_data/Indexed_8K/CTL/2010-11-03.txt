NEWS RELEASE  
 
 
 
 
 
CenturyLink Reports Third Quarter Earnings
MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) announces operating results for third quarter 2010.
 
 
 
 
 
CenturyLinks solid third quarter results reflect the success of our experienced and dedicated employees remaining focused on meeting the needs of our customers while continuing to make great progress with the integration of Embarq and planning for the pending Qwest merger, Glen F. Post, III, chief executive officer and president, said. In early October we successfully completed the third of five planned Embarq customer care system conversions and the two remaining conversions are on track to be completed by the end of third quarter 2011.
 
for third quarter 2010 were $1.75 billion compared to $1.87 billion in third quarter 2009. This anticipated revenue decline was primarily due to the impact of access line losses and lower access revenues, including the anticipated impact of wireless traffic migration, that more than offset revenue increases driven by growth in high-speed Internet customers and data transport demand from wireless providers.
Operating revenues
, excluding nonrecurring items, decreased 7.4% to $1.21 billion from $1.31 billion in third quarter 2009, primarily due to lower network access expenses and reduced transport costs due to the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal IP network, along with lower personnel costs and depreciation expense.
Operating expenses
, excluding nonrecurring items,decreased 3.7% to $895.3 million from $929.8 million in third quarter 2009. For third quarter 2010, CenturyLink achieved an operating cash flow margin, excluding non-recurring items, of 51.2% versus 49.6% in third quarter 2009.
Operating cash flow
 
 
CenturyLinks strategic revenues increased nearly 8% compared to third quarter last year as demand for broadband and IP-based services continues to grow, Post said. Our advanced communications network and operating systems position us well to meet the demand for advanced services such as IPTV and local and national Ethernet.
 
,excluding nonrecurring items, was $251.1 million in third quarter 2010 compared to $269.1 million in third quarter 2009. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $.83 for third quarter 2010, a 7.8% decrease from the $.90 reported in third quarter 2009.
Net income
 
,operating revenues, excluding nonrecurring items, increased 69.2% to $5.3 billion from $3.1 billion for the same period in 2009. Operating cash flow, excluding nonrecurring items, was $2.8 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $1.5 billion a year ago. Net income, excluding nonrecurring items, was $796.0 million in the first nine months of 2010 compared to $434.2 million during the same period in 2009. Diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, was $2.63 during the first nine months of 2010 compared to $2.60 in the first nine months of 2009. The primary driver of the increases outlined above for the first nine months of 2010 c ompared to the first nine months of 2009 is that the Embarq acquisition, which closed July 1, 2009, is included for the full nine months of 2010 and for only three of the nine months for 2009.
For the first nine months of 2010
 
, net income for third quarter 2010 was $231.2 million compared to $280.8 million for third quarter 2009 and, diluted earnings per share for third quarter 2010 was $.76 compared to $.94 for third quarter 2009. Third quarter 2010 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect after-tax integration costs associated with the Embarq acquisition of $14.1 million ($.05 per share), $2.6 million ($.01 per share) associated with Embarq severance related costs, and $3.2 million ($.01 per share) related to transaction and integration costs associated with the pending Qwest acquisition. Third quarter 2009 net income and diluted earnings per share reflect after-tax costs associated with the Embarq acquisition of $127.5 million ($.43 per share) that were more than offset by a net after-tax benefit of $133.2 million ($.44 per share) attributable to the extraordinary gain recognized upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and an after-tax benefit of $6.1 million ($.02 per share) related to the favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
 
Net income under GAAP for the first nine months of 2010 was $722.5 million compared to $417.0 million for the first nine months of 2009 and diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2010 was $2.39 compared to $2.50 for the first nine months of 2009. See the accompanying financial schedules for details of the Companys nonrecurring items for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
 
  For fourth quarter 2010, CenturyLink expects total operating revenues of $1.69 to $1.71 billion and diluted earnings per share of $.73 to $.77.
Outlook.
The Company is narrowing the range of its anticipated full year 2010 diluted earnings per share from its previously announced range of $3.30 to $3.40 to a range of $3.36 to $3.40, reflecting actual results for the first nine months of 2010 and fourth quarter 2010 guidance.
CenturyLinks previous guidance that 2010 operating revenues were expected to decline approximately 6.5% to 7.5% compared to pro forma 2009 revenues reflected approximately $135 to $145 million of reductions related to several unusual items, including traffic migration by a wireless carrier. The Company now expects 2010 operating revenues to decline 6.5% to 7.0% and the 2010 revenue impact of those unusual items to be $110 to $120 million primarily due to delays in the timing of the wireless carrier traffic migration.
The Company has identified the following items that can be expected to negatively impact 2011 results when compared to 2010. First, delays in the timing of the wireless carrier traffic migration discussed above are expected to negatively impact operating revenues by approximately $45 to $50 million in 2011 compared to the expected $30 million provided earlier this year. Second, Universal Service Fund receipts are expected to decline $25 to $30 million in 2011. The Company expects these items to negatively impact 2011 diluted earnings per share by $.10 to $.14. Also, the Company expects to launch its Prism IPTV service in additional markets in 2011. CenturyLink expects to provide full year 2011 earnings per share guidance in conjunction with its fourth quarter 2010 earnings release.
The Company continues to expect 2010 capital expenditures to be between $825 and $875 million.
These 2010 outlook figures exclude the effects of nonrecurring items, future changes in regulation, future integration expenses associated with the Embarq acquisition, integration and transaction expenses associated with the pending Qwest acquisition, any future changes in operating or capital plans related thereto, and any future mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other similar business transactions.
 
CenturyLink incurred pre-tax costs of $26.9 million related to the Embarq acquisition and $5.1 million related to the Qwest transaction. The Company also incurred approximately $11.9 million of integration-related capital expenditures.
Embarq Integration Update.
CenturyLink achieved more than $80 million in total operating cost synergies during third quarter 2010 and continues to expect to exit 2010 at the current annualized synergy run rate of $330 million.
On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink and Qwest Communications International Inc. (NYSE: Q) announced that their boards of directors approved a definitive agreement under which CenturyLink will acquire Qwest in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Qwest shareholders will receive 0.1664 CenturyLink shares for each share of Qwest common stock they own at closing, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2011, subject to various closing conditions. Upon closing of the transaction, CenturyLink shareholders are expected to own approximately 50.5% and Qwest shareholders are expected to own approximately 49.5% of the combine d company.
Qwest Transaction
.
 
CenturyLink and Qwest filed the requisite notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and received clearance on July 15, 2010 to proceed with the transaction.
 
The transaction requires approval from regulatory commissions in 21 states and the District of Columbia.  Twelve of those regulatory approvals have been received to date.  The Federal Communications Commission also is required to approve the transaction.
Special meetings of the shareholders of both CenturyLink and Qwest were held on August 24, 2010 to vote on the merger. At the special meeting of CenturyLinks shareholders held in Monroe, more than 97 percent of the votes cast supported the proposal to issue CenturyLink common stock to Qwest shareholders in connection with the proposed merger. At the special meeting of Qwests shareholders held in Denver, approximately 97 percent of the votes cast voted to adopt the merger agreement.
 
  CenturyLink returned approximately $219.7 million to shareholders in the third quarter through cash dividends paid on September 20, 2010, to shareholders of record as of September 7, 2010.  In accordance with their definitive merger agreement, CenturyLink and Qwest shall coordinate with each other through the closing date to designate the record dates and payment dates for the two companies respective quarterly dividends, such that neither CenturyLink shareholders nor Qwest shareholders shall receive more than one quarterly dividend during any calendar quarter.  Thus, the timing of CenturyLinks future dividends may deviate from historical dates.
Shareholder Returns.
This release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including but not limited to operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjustments to GAAP measures to exclude the effect of nonrecurring items and certain pro forma combined operating results.
