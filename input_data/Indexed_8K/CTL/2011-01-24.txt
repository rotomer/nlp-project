On January 19, 2011, CenturyLink, Inc. (CenturyLink) entered into a four-year revolving credit facility with various lenders.  This credit facility allows CenturyLink to borrow up to $1.0 billion initially with the total capacity of the credit facility increasing to $1.7 billion upon the consummation of CenturyLinks pending acquisition of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest).  Up to $400 million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit.
 
Interest will be assessed on future borrowings using the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin between .5% to 2.5% per annum depending on the type of loan and CenturyLinks then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating.  CenturyLinks obligations under the credit facility are currently guaranteed by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Embarq Corporation (Embarq), and upon consummation of the Qwest acquisition will also be guaranteed by Qwest and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
CenturyLinks ability to borrow under the credit facility is conditioned upon its continued compliance with various loan covenants, including financial covenants that stipulate that CenturyLink shall not permit (i) the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 and (ii) the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to the sum of consolidated interest expense and preferred stock dividends to be less than 1.5 to 1.0 (with all of the above terms having the meanings stipulated in the agreement).  Amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon specified events of default, including failures to make payments when due, defaults of obligations under certain other debt, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, commencement of bankruptcy proceedings and certain other failures to dis charge specified obligations or comply with specified laws.
 
CenturyLinks existing $750 million credit facility and Embarqs existing $800 million credit facility (which CenturyLink assumed upon its acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009) were both terminated upon the execution of this new credit facility.
 
The foregoing description of the credit facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the facility filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.

Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  This covenant shall survive the termination of this Ag reement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 10.7.  If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.  If any payment on a LIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.  In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
 
(b)           Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a r ate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.

If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Ag ent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the LIBOR Rate are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a LIBOR Loan as it sees fit.  All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained funding of each LIBOR Loan through the purchase in the London interbank market of one or more eurodollar deposits, in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan and having a maturity corresponding to the Interest Period for such Loan.

The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the open ing of business on the day on which such change becomes effective.
