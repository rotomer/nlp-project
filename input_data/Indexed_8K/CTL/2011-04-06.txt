In this current report on Form 8-K, references to CenturyLink, we, us and our refer to CenturyLink, Inc. (formerly named CenturyTel, Inc.).
 
 
 
On April 1, 2011, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 21, 2010 (the Merger Agreement), among Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest), CenturyLink and SB44 Acquisition Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink (Merger Sub), Merger Sub merged with and into Qwest, with Qwest continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of CenturyLink (the Merger).
 
As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Qwest common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.1664 share of our common stock (CTL common stock), with cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of the Merger, we will deliver approximately 294.0 million shares of CTL common stock to Qwest stockholders, based on the number of Qwest shares outstanding as of March 31, 2011.
 
The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.  Copies of press releases announcing our receipt of the final required federal and state regulatory approvals, and the completion of the Merger are attached as Exhibit 99.1, Exhibit 99.2 and Exhibit 99.3, respectively, to this current report on Form 8-K.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by and to the parties thereto as of specific dates. The statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of that contract between the parties and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the parties, which are not necessarily reflected in the Merger Agreement, in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.
 
 
.   Effective upon completion of the Merger, we expanded the size of our Board of Directors (the "Board") from 12 to 16 members.  At such time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our Board appointed the individuals set forth below (each of whom served as a director of Qwest prior to the effective time of the Merger) to the respective classes and principal committees of the Board specified below:
Appointment of New Directors
 
 
 
In connection with their appointments as outside directors, the Compensation Committee of our Board intends to grant to each of the new directors listed above a grant of restricted shares of CTL common stock on May 19, 2011, which is the day after our 2011 annual shareholders meeting.  Although the Committee has not yet determined the amount of these grants, we expect them to be consistent with the amount of our recent director equity grants, which have had a value of $100,000 based on our stock valuation at the time of the grants.  With respect to each such restricted share award, the shares of restricted stock are expected to vest upon the earlier of (i) one-third per year on each of May 15, 2012, May 15, 2013 and May 15, 2014, (ii) the date the director dies or becomes disabled, or (iii) the occurren ce of a change of control of CenturyLink, all as described further in our applicable equity stock plan.  In addition, these shares of restricted stock will have such other terms as are set forth in our equity plan and in the form of restricted stock agreement to be entered into with each director.  The grant of these awards, and their actual amounts and terms, remain subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
 
Members of our Board are subject to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, among other things, prohibit a director from serving on more than two additional unaffiliated public company boards.  In addition to serving on our Board, James A. Unruh serves on the board of directors of three unaffiliated public companies.  In connection with appointing Mr. Unruh to the Board, the Board waived compliance by him with the above-described service limitation, subject to the understanding that this waiver permits Mr. Unruh to serve only on the boards of the unaffiliated companies on which he is currently serving.
 
.  On April 1, 2011, David D. Cole replaced Neil A. Sweasy as our Controller. For further information on this and other changes in management made in connection with the Merger, see Item 8.01 below.
Other Changes in Management
 
 
.  In connection with the Merger, all 12 of our incumbent directors will continue to serve as directors, each in the same class of directorship to which they were allocated immediately prior to the Merger.  In connection with the Merger, our Board changed the committee responsibilities of three of our incumbent directors.  Listed below are the current principal committee positions of our 12 incumbent directors:
Change in Committee Responsibilities of Continuing Directors
 
 
 
     *  Neither Richard A. Gephardt nor Glen F. Post, III currently serve on any of these principal committees.
 
.  Glen F. Post, III, Karen A. Puckett and R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. continue to serve as our principal executive officer, principal operating officer and principal financial officer, respectively.
Continuation of Responsibilities of Executive Officers
 
Stacey W. Goff, Dennis G. Huber and William E. Cheek continue to serve as executive officers with titles and responsibilities substantially similar to their titles and responsibilities prior to the effective date of the Merger.  David D. Cole, age 53, will also continue to serve as an executive officer with substantially similar responsibilities to those disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but, effective immediately, he will also serve as our Controller.
 
.  Effective upon completion of the Merger, we appointed Christopher K. Ancell of Qwest as an executive officer of CenturyLink. Mr. Ancell, age 49, will serve as President of our Business Markets Group.  Mr. Ancell has served as Qwests Executive Vice President, Business Markets Group, since August 2009.

Prior to then, Mr. Ancell held several other management positions with Qwest, including Vice President of Sales Support for the Business Markets Group and Vice President of Hosting Sales.
Appointment of New Executive Officer
 
.  On March 18 and March 24, 2011, respectively, we issued press releases announcing the receipt of certain federal and state regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger.

Exhibit 99.5
Introduction
 
On April 1, 2011, CenturyLink, Inc. (CenturyLink) acquired Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest) in a stock-for-stock transaction.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Qwest stockholders received 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Qwest common stock owned at closing.  The aggregate consideration approximated $12.282 billion, based on (i) the number of CenturyLink common shares issued to consummate the merger (294 million), (ii) the closing stock price of CenturyLink common stock as of March 31, 2011 ($41.55), (iii) the pre-combination portion of Qwests share-based compensation awards assumed by CenturyLink ($61 million) and (iv) cash paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares ($5 million).
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information combines the historical consolidated financial statements of CenturyLink and Qwest as if the merger had previously occurred on the dates specified below.
 
As a result of the merger, CenturyLink shareholders owned approximately 51% and the former Qwest stockholders owned approximately 49% of the CenturyLink common shares outstanding immediately after consummation of the merger.  After consideration of all applicable factors pursuant to the business combination accounting rules, the parties considered CenturyLink to be the accounting acquirer for purposes of the preparation of the pro forma financial information included below because CenturyLink issued its common stock to acquire Qwest (at a premium), the board of directors of the combined company will be composed principally of former CenturyLink directors and the executive management team of the combined company will be led by current CenturyLink executives, including, but not limited to, its Chief Executive Office r, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The results of operations of Qwest will be included in CenturyLinks consolidated financial statements beginning April 1, 2011.
 
Pro forma information
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010 are based on (i) the historical consolidated results of operations and financial condition of CenturyLink and its subsidiaries; and (ii) the historical consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Qwest and its subsidiaries.  Such pro forma information also reflects certain effects of CenturyLinks acquisition of Qwest, as further described below.
 
The pro forma financial information reflects an aggregate consideration of approximately $12.282 billion for the Qwest acquisition, as calculated below (in millions, except the exchange ratio and price per share):
 
 
 
 
Pro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are described in the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information, which are referred to herein as the Notes.
 
The pro forma financial information related to the Qwest acquisition was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and is based on the assumption that the acquisition of Qwest took place as of December 31, 2010 for purposes of the pro forma balance sheet and as of January 1, 2010 for purposes of the pro forma statement of income.  In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the actual consolidated financial statements of CenturyLink will reflect the Qwest acquisition only from and after the date of acquisition.  CenturyLink has not yet undertaken any detailed analysis of the fair value of Qwests assets and liabilities, and is not expected to complete this analysis until up to one year after the mergers closing date.  The final fair value assignments could differ materiall y from the preliminary assignments reflected herein and result in our actual results differing materially from those presented in the pro forma statement of income.  See the Notes below for additional information.
 
For purposes of the pro forma information, adjustments for estimated transaction costs (primarily investment banker advisory fees and legal fees) and integration costs for the Qwest acquisition have been excluded.  The combined company will incur integration costs related to system and customer conversions (including hardware and software costs), branding initiatives, and certain employee-related severance costs.  The specific details of these integration plans will continue to be refined over the next couple of years and the related costs could vary significantly from the estimates provided herein. Based on current plans and information, CenturyLink estimates that it will incur approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion of non-recurring operating expenses associated with transaction and integration costs and approxim ately $200 million of non-recurring capital costs associated with integration activities.
 
In addition, all remaining integration costs associated with our July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq Corporation (Embarq) have been excluded. Based on current plans and information, we estimate that we will incur approximately $80-90 million of operating expenses subsequent to December 31, 2010 related to the remaining Embarq integration activities.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information included herein does not give effect to any potential cost reductions or other operating efficiencies that could result from the Qwest acquisition, including but not limited to those associated with potential (i) reductions of corporate overhead, (ii) eliminations of duplicate functions and (iii) increased operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities from each company.
 
The pro forma information has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined operating results or financial position that would have occurred if such transaction had been consummated on the dates and in accordance with the assumptions described herein, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.
 
Both CenturyLinks and Qwests results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 were impacted by various one-time charges which are described in more detail in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.  You are urged to read the pro forma information below together with CenturyLinks and Qwests publicly-available historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following preliminary allocation of the Qwest purchase price is based on CenturyLinks preliminary estimates of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Qwest.  The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the fair value of such assets and liabilities as of April 1, 2011, the consummation date of the acquisition, and is expected to be completed within one year after the closing date.  The final determination of the purchase price allocation may be significantly different than the preliminary estimates used in these pro forma financial statements.
 
The estimated purchase price of Qwest (as calculated in the manner described above) is allocated to the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed based on the following preliminary basis (amounts in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information.  These adjustments give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the Qwest merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined company.  All adjustments are based on current assumptions and are subject to change upon completion of the final purchase price allocation based on the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired from Qwest at the merger closing date.
 
Balance Sheet Adjustments
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income Statement Adjustments
 
Pro forma income statement adjustments include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of preparing these pro forma financial statements, the fair value of Qwests property, plant and equipment was estimated to approximate its carrying value on the date of acquisition. To the extent that the final purchase price allocation causes CenturyLinks depreciation and amortization expense to differ from that presented in the accompanying pro forma statement of income information, annual earnings per common share will be affected by $.01 per share for every $9 million difference in annual depreciation and amortization expense.  Thus, for example, if CenturyLink ultimately allocates an additional $1.179 billion of the aggregate purchase price to property, plant and equipment (representing a 10% increase in the amount that has been preliminarily allocated to such assets as described above), the annu al depreciation and amortization would increase by approximately $177 million (assuming a composite annual depreciation rate of 15%) and the annual earnings per share would decrease by $.19 per share for 2010 from the amounts presented in the accompanying pro forma information.  In contrast, a 10% reduction in the amount that has been preliminarily allocated to property, plant and equipment would decrease depreciation and amortization by $177 million (assuming a composite annual depreciation rate of 15%) and increase annual earnings per share by $.19 per share for 2010 from the amounts presented herein.
 
In calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2010, $8.525 million (which represents the earnings applicable to unvested restricted stock grants on such date) was subtracted from net income prior to dividing such figure by average basic and diluted common shares outstanding.
