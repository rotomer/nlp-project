Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On June 8, 2011, Qwest Corporation ("QC"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of both CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink") and CenturyLink's wholly owned subsidiary, Qwest Communications International Inc. ("QCII"), publicly sold $661,250,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Notes due 2051 (the "Notes"), including $86,250,000 principal amount that was sold pursuant an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters for the transaction.
     The public offering price of the Notes was 100% of the principal amount. After deducting underwriting discounts and QC's estimated expenses, QC expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of approximately $643 million. QC intends to use these net proceeds, together with borrowings from CenturyLink, to provide the total amount of funds required to redeem $825 million aggregate principal amount of QC's 7.875% Notes due 2011, and to pay related fees and expenses.
     The Notes were sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated June 1, 2011 among QC and the underwriters listed therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"), and a related price determination agreement dated June 1, 2011 among the same parties (the "Price Determination Agreement"). The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-156101-03), filed by QCII, QC and certain of their affiliates with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 12, 2008, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated June 1, 2011 (together, the "Registration Statement").
     The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of October 15, 1999 between QC and Bank of New York Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust Company, National Association), as heretofore amended and supplemented, including by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture between QC and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture"). The Notes are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. QC will pay interest on the Notes quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 2011. QC may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on and after June 1, 2016 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Notes are QC's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior to any of its future subordinated debt and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
     The above descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Price Determination Agreement, the form of the Supplemental Indenture and the form of the Notes, copies of which are filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Each of these exhibits (as well as the opinion of counsel also filed as an exhibit hereto), is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.

     (c) The Company will notify the Underwriters promptly, and will confirm such advice in writing, (i) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose or the threat thereof, or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, (iv) until the end of such period as the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered (or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Securities Act) in connection with sales of the Securities by an Underwriter or dealer, of the happening of any event that in the judgment of the Company requires the Company to file an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and (v) of receipt by the Company, or any representatives or attorney of the Company, of any other communication from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the offering of the Securities.

     (p) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, prior to the Renewal Deadline, the Company will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities (either as the registrant or as a co-registrant), in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (ii) if the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, the Company will file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline and (iii) the Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be).

     (b) Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation unless (i) the Company and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the employment of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such indemnified party may arise and for this reason it is not desirable for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and also the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such indemnified parties), in which case the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above and the indemnifying party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in
 
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
pro rata
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee and agent of any Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee and agent of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
8. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse at the Closing Date, or the relevant Delivery Date, as the case may be, to purchase any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date, in the proportions which the principal amount of Securities which they have respectively agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof bears to the aggregate
Substitution of Underwriters
 
principal amount of Securities which all such non-defaulting Underwriters have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as such non-defaulting Underwriters may specify; provided that in no event shall the maximum principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by more than one-ninth of the principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter without the prior written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse at the Closing Date, or the relevant Delivery Date, as the case may be, to purchase any Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date and arrangements satisfactory to any non-defaulting Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement (or, with respect to the Underwriters' exercise of any applicable over-allotment option for the purchase of Option Securities on a Delivery Date after the Closing Date, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase, and the Company to sell, such Option Securities on such Delivery Date) will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company for the purchase or sale of any Securities under this Agreement. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or the relevant Delivery Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
9. . Until the Closing Date or any relevant Delivery Date, as the case may be, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date or such Delivery Date, as the case may be, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder or (ii) any condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled at or prior to the Closing Date or such Delivery Date, as the case may be. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(l), 4(m) and 7 hereof.

EXHIBIT B
     1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
     2. The Company has full corporate power and corporate authority to own or lease all the assets owned or leased by it and, to the best of my knowledge, has all necessary and material authorizations, approvals, orders, licenses, certificates, franchises, and permits of and from all governmental regulatory officials and bodies to own its properties and to lawfully conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
     3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the issuance and sale of the Securities) will not (i) result in a violation of any of the terms or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws, each as amended, of the Company or (ii) violate or conflict with any franchise or any judgment, ruling, decree, order, statute (including the Communications Act of 1934), rule or regulation of any court or other governmental agency or body (including the Federal Communications Commission) known to me and applicable to the business or properties of the Company or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company pursuant to the terms or provisions of, or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or give any other party a right to terminate any of its obligations under, or result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, voting trust agreement, loan agreement, bond, debenture, note agreement or other evidence of indebtedness, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its properties is or are bound or affected (the "applicable agreements"), other than with respect to this clause (iii) any breaches, violations, defaults, terminations or accelerations with respect to any applicable agreement that will not, or are not likely to, have a Material Adverse Effect.
     4. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, to the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or any of its officers, in their capacity as such, before or by any United States federal or state court, commission, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, domestic or foreign, which in my opinion is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
     5. The Company has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of the Securities and has duly executed and delivered the Securities. The Securities, when duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and assuming due payment by the Underwriters in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will entitle their holders to the benefits provided by the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding
 
obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except (i) that the enforcement thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally, (ii) the enforceability thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought and (iii) certain provisions contained in the Indenture relating to remedies may be limited by public policy, equitable principles or other provisions of applicable laws, rules, regulations, court decisions or constitutional requirements, but in my judgment the matters in this clause (iii) do not result in the remedies that remain available being inadequate for the enforcement of the Indenture and the Securities.
     6. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration, qualification or declaration with, any court or United States federal, state or local governmental agency or body (including the Federal Communications Commission) is required for (i) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities or the Indenture by the Company, (ii) the authorization, offer, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities by the Company or (iii) the consummation by the Company of the transactions on its part contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except such as may have been previously obtained under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under foreign or state securities or blue sky laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the rules of FINRA in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.

     7. The Company (i) has full corporate power and corporate authority to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, (ii) has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and (iii) has duly executed and delivered the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture.
     8. The statements in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 under the heading "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory MattersWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation," and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the caption "BusinessRegulation", insofar as such statements purport to summarize applicable provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, are accurate summaries in all material respects of the provisions purported to be summarized.
     I have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. Although I have not verified and am not opining upon or
 
 
assuming any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, on the basis of my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and my discussions with certain officers and employees of the Company, certain of its legal counsel, its independent registered public accountants and your representatives and counsel, nothing has come to my attention which would lead me to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date (including any Rule 430 Information), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the date of this opinion, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except that I express no opinion with respect to financial statements, schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein) or the Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee on Form T-1).
 
EXHIBIT C
     1. (i) At the Effective Date, the Registration Statement, as of the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale Information, and, as of its date, the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto), including each document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as of the time such documents were filed, complied in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and (ii) at the Effective Date, the Indenture complied in all material respects as to form with the Trust Indenture Act and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act (except that we express no opinion as to (a) financial statements, schedules and other financial or statistical data contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein) and (b) the Statements of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1s") contained in, made a part of or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement).
     2. The Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering has been instituted or is threatened or pending and, to the best of our knowledge, no notice of objection of the SEC to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the 1933 Act shall have been received.
     3. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration, qualification or declaration with, any court or United States federal governmental agency or body is required for (i) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities or the Indenture by the Company, (ii) the authorization, offer, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities by the Company or (iii) the consummation by the Company of the transactions on its part contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except such as may have been previously obtained under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act or the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and such as may be required under the rules of FINRA in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
     4. The statements under the headings "Description of the Notes" and "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus are accurate in all material respects and, insofar as such description contains statements constituting a summary of the legal matters or documents referred to therein, such statements fairly summarize the information referred to therein.
     5. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, to the best of our knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers in their capacity as such, before or by any United States federal court, commission,
 
regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, domestic or foreign, which in our opinion is likely to materially and adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as they exist on the date hereof.
     6. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be, an "investment company" or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     7. To the best of our knowledge, the issue and sale of the Securities and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby will not violate or conflict with any statute, rule or regulation of any United States court or governmental agency or body known to us and applicable to the business or properties of the Company, except where such violation or conflict would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
     Other than with respect to the opinion expressed in paragraph 4 above, we have not ourselves verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed such information with certain officers and employees of the Company, certain of its legal counsel and its independent registered public accountants and with the Underwriters and their counsel. On the basis of such review and discussion (relying as to materiality upon the statements of the officers and other representatives of the Company, although nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that it is unreasonable for us or you to so rely thereon), but without assuming any responsibility for, or independently verifying, any information other than as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date (including any Rule 430 Information), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the date of this letter, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except that we express no belief with respect to (i) financial statements and notes thereto, related schedules and any other financial data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, (ii) the Form T-1s or (iii) statements or omissions based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein).
     As special counsel to the Company, we do not as a matter of course review or pass on all agreements or proceedings to which the Company or its subsidiaries have become parties nor have we done so in connection with this opinion. Accordingly, whenever any statement in this letter is qualified by the phrase "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us" or a phrase of similar import, such phrase is intended to mean the actual knowledge of information by the
 
lawyers in our firm who have been principally involved in negotiating the subject transaction and preparing the pertinent documents and any other lawyers in our firm devoting substantive attention to matters for the Company, having substantial responsibility for managing the client relationship with the Company or overseeing the firm's provision of securities law advice to the Company, but does not include the information that might be revealed if there were to be undertaken a canvass of all lawyers in our firm, a general search of our files, a review of all of the Company's contacts or any other type of independent investigation. Any certificate or representation obtained by us from the officers of the Company in connection with this opinion has been relied upon by us as to factual matters without independent verification, but nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that it is unreasonable for us or you to rely thereon.
     In rendering the foregoing opinion, counsel may rely, to the extent they deem such reliance proper, on the opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to Underwriters' counsel as to matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the United States, and as to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company and of government officials; provided that such counsel shall state that the opinion of any other counsel is in form satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, such counsel and you are justified in relying on such opinions of other counsel.
