On May 20, 2011, CenturyLink, Inc. (CenturyLink, we, us or our) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Original Filing) summarizing the results of the matters voted on at our annual meeting of shareholders held on May 18, 2011 (the Annual Meeting).  The sole purpose of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A is to amend the Original Filing to disclose our decision as to how frequently we will conduct future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.
Item 5.07.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported, at the Annual Meeting we asked our shareholders to vote on an advisory proposal regarding the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  Consistent with the recommendation of our Board of Directors, our shareholders voted, on an advisory basis, in favor of holding these votes annually.  Our Board of Directors has considered the results of this advisory vote and has determined that we will hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation every year until the next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of these votes, which will occur no later than our annual meeting of shareholders in 2017.
Forward Looking Statements Note
Certain non-historical statements made in this filing and future oral or written statements or press releases by us or our management are intended to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control.  Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect.  Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry (including those arising out of proposed rules of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding intercarrier compensation and the Universal Service Fund and the FCCs related Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released on February 8, 2011); our ability to effectively adjust to changes in the communications industry and changes in the composition of our markets and product mix caused by our recent acquisitions of Savvis, Qwest and Embarq; our ability to successfully integrate the operations of Savvis, Qwest and Embarq into our operations, including the possibility that the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions cannot be fully realized in a timely manner or at all, or that integrating the acquired operations will be more difficult, disruptive or costly than anticipated; our ability to use net operating loss carryovers of Qwest in projected amounts; the effects of changes in our assignment of the Qwest or Savvis purchase price after the date hereof; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; any adverse developments in legal proceedings involving us; our ability to pay a $2.90 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position; unanticipated increases or other changes in our future cash requirements, whether caused by unanticipated increases in capital expenditures, increases in pension funding requirements or otherwise; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical, pension or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business, our July 2011 acquisition of Savvis, our April 2011 acquisition of Qwest and our July 2009 acquisition of Embarq are described in greater detail in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, as updated and supplemented by our subsequent SEC reports, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2011, and March 31, 2011.
You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements.  You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing.  We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward-looking statements for any reason.
