On March 12, 2012, CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink") completed its previously-announced public sale of $2.05 billion aggregate principal amount of its unsecured senior notes, consisting of (i) $1,400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.80% Senior Notes, Series T, due 2022 (the "Series T Notes") and (ii) $650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.65% Senior Notes, Series U, due 2042 (the "Series U Notes" and, together with the Series T Notes, the "Senior Notes").
The public offering prices of the Series T Notes and Series U Notes were 99.842% and 99.905% of their respective principal amounts. After deducting underwriting discounts and CenturyLink's estimated expenses, CenturyLink expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes of approximately $2.03 billion. CenturyLink intends to use these net proceeds, together with available cash or additional borrowings under its credit facility, to provide the total amount of funds necessary to enable its wholly-owned subsidiary, Embarq Corporation, to repurchase two series of its debt securities for an aggregate purchase price of up to $2,050,000,000 pursuant to a pending tender offer announced on March 5, 2012 (the "Tender Offer").
The Senior Notes were sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated March 5, 2012 between CenturyLink and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement") and a related price determination agreement dated March 5, 2012 among the same parties (the "Price Determination Agreement"). The Senior Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-179888), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2012, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated March 5, 2012 (together, the "Registration Statement").
The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 31, 1994 between CenturyLink and Regions Bank (successor to Regions Bank of Louisiana and First American Bank & Trust of Louisiana), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as heretofore supplemented through the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 12, 2012, between CenturyLink and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture"). CenturyLink will pay interest on each series of the Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2012. CenturyLink may redeem each series of the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) applicable to each series of Senior Notes plus 50 basis points. The Senior Notes are CenturyLink's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior to any of its future subordinated debt and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
The above descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, the Price Determination Agreement, the Supplemental Indenture and forms of the
 
Senior Notes, copies of which are filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Each of these exhibits (as well as the opinion of counsel also filed as an exhibit hereto), is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
Forward-Looking Statements

Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to the possibility that Embarq Corporation's existing noteholders will not be receptive to the Tender Offer; changes in general market, economic, tax, regulatory or industry conditions that impact the ability or willingness of Embarq Corporation to consummate the Tender Offer on the terms described above or at all; corporate developments that could preclude, impair or delay the Tender Offer due to restrictions under the federal securities laws; changes in the terms or availability of CenturyLink's credit facilities; changes in CenturyLink's credit ratings; changes in CenturyLink's cash requirements or financial position; CenturyLink's continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; and other risks referenced from time to time in CenturyLink's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurances that the above-described transactions will be consummated on the terms described above or at all. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for CenturyLink to identify all such factors, nor can CenturyLink predict the impact of each such factor on its plans, or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward-looking statements.

Indemnification
(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
 
not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation unless (i) the Company and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the employment of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the Company and such indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such indemnified party may arise and for this reason it is not desirable for the same counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and also the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such indemnified parties), in which case the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
 
party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above and the indemnifying party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
pro rata
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee and agent of any Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee and agent of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
 
8. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse at the Closing Date to purchase any of the Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase, in the proportions which the principal amount of Securities which they have respectively agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities which all such non-defaulting Underwriters have so agreed to purchase, or in such other proportions as such non-defaulting Underwriters may specify; provided that in no event shall the maximum principal amount of Securities which any Underwriter has become obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by more than one-ninth of the principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter without the prior written consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse at the Closing Date to purchase any Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities and arrangements satisfactory to any non-defaulting Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company for the purchase or sale of any Securities under this Agreement. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 8 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
Substitution of Underwriters
9. . Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder or (ii) any condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled at or prior to the Closing Date. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(l), 4(m) and 7 hereof.

EXHIBIT B
1. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization.
2. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has full power and authority to own or lease all the assets owned or leased by it and, to the best of my knowledge, has all necessary and material authorizations, approvals, orders, licenses, certificates, franchises, and permits of and from all governmental regulatory officials and bodies to own its properties and to lawfully conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
3. The Company or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries is the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the issued common stock of each of the Subsidiaries.
4. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the issuance and sale of the Securities) will not (i) result in a violation of any of the terms or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable instruments) of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or (ii) violate or conflict with any franchise or any judgment, ruling, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental agency or body known to me and applicable to the business or properties of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms or provisions of, or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or give any other party a right to terminate any of its obligations under, or result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, voting trust agreement, loan agreement, bond, debenture, note agreement or other evidence of indebtedness, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is or are bound or affected (the "applicable agreements"), other than with respect to this clause (iii) any breaches, violations, defaults, terminations or accelerations with respect to any applicable agreement that will not, or are not likely to, have a Material Adverse Effect.
5. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, to the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, in their capacity as such, before or by any United States federal or state court, commission, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, domestic or foreign, which in my opinion is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
I have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. Although I have not verified and am not opining upon or assuming any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, on the basis of my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and my discussions with certain officers and employees of the Company, certain of its legal counsel, its independent registered public accountants and your representatives and counsel, nothing has come to my attention which would lead me to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date (including any Rule 430 Information), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the date of this opinion, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except that I express no opinion with respect to financial statements, schedules and other financial, statistical or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein) or the Statements of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act.
 
EXHIBIT C
1. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
2. The Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. The Securities, when duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and assuming due payment by the Underwriters in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will entitle their holders to the benefits provided by the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except (i) that the enforcement thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally, (ii) the enforceability thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought and (iii) certain provisions contained in the Indenture relating to remedies may be limited by public policy, equitable principles or other provisions of applicable laws, rules, regulations, court decisions or constitutional requirements, but in our judgment the matters in this clause (iii) do not result in the remedies that remain available being inadequate for the enforcement of the Indenture and the Securities.
3. (i) As of the date the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "10-K Date"), the Registration Statement, as of the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale Information, and, as of its date, the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto), including each document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, as of the time such documents were filed, complied in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and (ii) at the 10-K Date, the Indenture complied in all material respects as to form with the Trust Indenture Act and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act (except that we express no opinion as to (a) financial statements, schedules and other financial or statistical data contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (or incorporated by reference therein) and (b) the Statements of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1s") contained in, made a part of or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement).
4. The Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Commission under the Securities Act and, to the best of our knowledge, no order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering has been instituted or is threatened or pending and, to the best of our knowledge, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act shall have been received.
 
5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration, qualification or declaration with, any court or United States federal, state or local governmental agency or body is required for (i) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities or the Indenture by the Company, (ii) the authorization, offer, issuance, sale or delivery of the Securities by the Company or (iii) the consummation by the Company of the transactions on its part contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except such as may have been previously obtained under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act or the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and such as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the rules of FINRA in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
6. The statements under the heading "Description of Debt Securities of CenturyLink" in the Registration Statement and the headings "Description of the Notes" and "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus are accurate in all material respects and, insofar as such description contains statements constituting a summary of the legal matters or documents referred to therein, such statements fairly summarize the information referred to therein.
7. The Company has full corporate power and authority to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company and is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except (i) that the enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally, (ii) that the enforceability of the Indenture is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought and (iii) that certain provisions contained in the Indenture relating to remedies may limited by public policy, equitable principles or other provisions of applicable laws, rules, regulations, court decisions or constitutional requirements, but in our judgment the matters in this clause (iii) do not result in the remedies that remain available being inadequate for the enforcement of the Indenture.
8. The issue and sale of the Securities by the Company, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) result in a violation of any of the terms or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable instruments) of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or (ii) to the best of our knowledge, violate or conflict with any franchise or any judgment, ruling, decree, order, statute, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental agency or body known to us and applicable to the business or properties of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, except where such violation or conflict would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
9. Except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, to the best of our knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers in their capacity as such, before or by any United States federal or state court, commission, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, domestic or foreign, which in our opinion is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
10. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be, an "investment company" or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Other than with respect to the opinion expressed in paragraph 6 above, we have not ourselves verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed such information with certain officers and employees of the Company, certain of its legal counsel and its independent registered public accountants and with the Underwriters and their counsel. On the basis of such review and discussion (relying as to materiality upon the statements of the officers and other representatives of the Company, although nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that it is unreasonable for us or you to so rely thereon), but without assuming any responsibility for, or independently verifying, any information other than as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date (including any Rule 430 Information) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, as of its date and as of the date of this letter, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except that we express no belief with respect to (i) financial statements and notes thereto, related schedules and any other financial or statistical data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, (ii) the Form T-1s) or (iii) statements or omissions based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein).
As special counsel to the Company, we do not as a matter of course review or pass on all agreements or proceedings to which the Company or its subsidiaries have become parties nor have we done so in connection with this opinion. Accordingly, whenever any statement in this letter is qualified by the phrase "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us" or a phrase of similar import, such phrase is intended to mean the actual knowledge of information by the lawyers in our firm who have been principally involved in negotiating the subject transaction and preparing the pertinent documents and any other lawyers in our firm devoting substantive attention to matters for the Company, having substantial responsibility for managing the client relationship with the Company or overseeing the firm's provision of securities law advice to the Company, but does not include the information that might be revealed if there were to be
 
undertaken a canvass of all lawyers in our firm, a general search of our files, a review of all of the Company's contacts or any other type of independent investigation. Any certificate or representation obtained by us from the officers of the Company in connection with this opinion has been relied upon by us as to factual matters without independent verification, but nothing has come to our attention that would lead us to believe that it is unreasonable for us or you to rely thereon.
In rendering the foregoing opinion, counsel may rely, to the extent they deem such reliance proper, on the opinions (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Underwriters' counsel) of other counsel reasonably acceptable to Underwriters' counsel as to matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and the State of Louisiana, and as to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company and of government officials; provided that such counsel shall state that the opinion of any other counsel is in form satisfactory to such counsel and, in such counsel's opinion, such counsel and you are justified in relying on such opinions of other counsel. Copies of all such opinions and certificates shall be addressed to the Underwriters (or shall state that the Underwriters may rely thereon) and shall be furnished to Underwriters' counsel on the Closing Date.

Dated: March     , 2012
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated: March     , 2012
 
This Series T Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the "Securities") issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 31, 1994, as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture") dated as of March 12, 2012 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and Regions Bank (successor-in-interest to First American Bank & Trust of Louisiana and Regions Bank of Louisiana), as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 5.80% Senior Notes, Series T, due 2022 (the "Series T Notes"). Such series is being initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $1,400,000,000. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
The Series T Notes are redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the Corporation's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (a) of 100% of the principal amount of the Series T Notes to be redeemed; and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Series T Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points. In each case the Corporation will pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.
The Corporation will mail notice of redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Series T Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Series T Notes will state, among other things, the amount of Series T Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Series T Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Series T Notes that have been called for redemption at the redemption date.
If less than all of the Series T Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will be notified at least 45 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of Series T Notes to be redeemed and the redemption date. The Trustee will select by lot, or in such other manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Series T Notes to be redeemed in part.
If the Corporation gives notice as provided in the Indenture, and funds for the redemption of any Series T Notes (or any portion thereof) called for redemption will have been made available on the redemption date referred to in such notice, those Series T Notes (or any portion thereof) will cease to bear interest on that redemption date and the only right of the holders of those Series T Notes will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Corporation has exercised its right to redeem the Series T Notes as described above, it will make an offer to each holder of Series T Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000) of such holder's Series T Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Series T Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Series T Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Corporation's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Corporation will mail a notice to each holder of Series T Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and (i) offering to repurchase the Series T Notes on the repurchase date specified in the notice, which date will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, (ii) indicating that all Series T Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment and any Series T Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iii) specifying the CUSIP numbers for the Series T Notes, (iv) stating that, unless the Corporation defaults in its payment in connection with the Change of Control Repurchase Event, all Series T Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Corporation's offer to repurchase such Series T Notes will cease to accrue interest after such repurchase, (v) stating that holders electing to have any Series T Notes repurchased by the Corporation will be required to surrender such Series T Notes to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the repurchase date, (vi) stating that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the repurchase date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Series T Notes, the principal amount of Series T Notes delivered for repurchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing his election to have the Series T Notes repurchased and (vii) stating that holders whose Series T Notes are being repurchased only in part will be issued new Series T Notes in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Series T Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Corporation's offer to repurchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date specified in the notice. The Corporation will cause its offer to purchase to remain open for at least 20 Business Days or such longer period as is required by applicable law. The Corporation will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Series T Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Series T Notes, the Corporation will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 4.03 of the Seventh Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Corporation will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all the Series T Notes or portions of
 
the Series T Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Corporation's offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all the Series T Notes or portions of the Series T Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Series T Notes properly accepted, together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Series T Notes being purchased by the Corporation.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Series T Notes properly tendered the repurchase price for such Series T Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Series T Note of the same series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Series T Notes surrendered, if any; that each new Series T Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Corporation will publicly announce the results of its offer to repurchase the Series T Notes on or as soon as practicable after the repurchase date.
provided
The Corporation will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series T Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to an offer made by the Corporation and such third party purchases all Series T Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such third party's offer.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Corporation's board of directors who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the Original Issue Date; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the holders of Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
provided, however,
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series T Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Series T Note at the times and place and at the rate and in the currency herein prescribed.

The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any Interest Payment Date, any redemption date or the Stated Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date that payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, such redemption date or Stated Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date of that payment on that next succeeding Business Day.

Principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Series U Note shall be payable at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in the City of Monroe, State of Louisiana, or the Borough of Manhattan, The City and State of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Corporation by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the security register; and provided further, that, in the case of payments of principal and premium, if any, this Series U Note is first surrendered to the Paying Agent.

Dated: March     , 2012
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated: March     , 2012
 
This Series U Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Corporation (the "Securities") issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 31, 1994, as supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture") dated as of March 12, 2012 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Corporation and Regions Bank (successor-in-interest to First American Bank & Trust of Louisiana and Regions Bank of Louisiana), as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 7.65% Senior Notes, Series U, due 2042 (the "Series U Notes"). Such series is being initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $650,000,000. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
The Series U Notes are redeemable, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the Corporation's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (a) of 100% of the principal amount of the Series U Notes to be redeemed; and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Series U Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points. In each case the Corporation will pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.
The Corporation will mail notice of redemption at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Series U Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Series U Notes will state, among other things, the amount of Series U Notes to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Series U Notes to be redeemed. Unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Series U Notes that have been called for redemption at the redemption date.
If less than all of the Series U Notes are redeemed, the Trustee will be notified at least 45 days before giving notice of redemption, or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee, of the aggregate principal amount of Series U Notes to be redeemed and the redemption date. The Trustee will select by lot, or in such other manner it deems fair and appropriate, the Series U Notes to be redeemed in part.
If the Corporation gives notice as provided in the Indenture, and funds for the redemption of any Series U Notes (or any portion thereof) called for redemption will have been made available on the redemption date referred to in such notice, those Series U Notes (or any portion thereof) will cease to bear interest on that redemption date and the only right of the holders of those Series U Notes will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Corporation has exercised its right to redeem the Series U Notes as described above, it will make an offer to each holder of Series U Notes to repurchase all or any part (in excess of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000) of such holder's Series U Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Series U Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Series U Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Corporation's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Corporation will mail a notice to each holder of Series U Notes, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and (i) offering to repurchase the Series U Notes on the repurchase date specified in the notice, which date will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, (ii) indicating that all Series U Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment and any Series U Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iii) specifying the CUSIP numbers for the Series U Notes, (iv) stating that, unless the Corporation defaults in its payment in connection with the Change of Control Repurchase Event, all Series U Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Corporation's offer to repurchase such Series U Notes will cease to accrue interest after such repurchase, (v) stating that holders electing to have any Series U Notes repurchased by the Corporation will be required to surrender such Series U Notes to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the repurchase date, (vi) stating that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the repurchase date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of Series U Notes, the principal amount of Series U Notes delivered for repurchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing his election to have the Series U Notes repurchased and (vii) stating that holders whose Series U Notes are being repurchased only in part will be issued new Series U Notes in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Series U Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Corporation's offer to repurchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date specified in the notice. The Corporation will cause its offer to purchase to remain open for at least 20 Business Days or such longer period as is required by applicable law. The Corporation will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Series U Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Series U Notes, the Corporation will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 4.03 of the Seventh Supplemental Indenture by virtue of such conflict.
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Corporation will, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all the Series U Notes or portions
 
of the Series U Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Corporation's offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price in respect of all the Series U Notes or portions of the Series U Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Series U Notes properly accepted, together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Series U Notes being purchased by the Corporation.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Series U Notes properly tendered the repurchase price for such Series U Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Series U Note of the same series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Series U Notes surrendered, if any; that each new Series U Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Corporation will publicly announce the results of its offer to repurchase the Series U Notes on or as soon as practicable after the repurchase date.
provided
The Corporation will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Series U Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements applicable to an offer made by the Corporation and such third party purchases all Series U Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such third party's offer.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Corporation's board of directors who (1) was a member of such board of directors on the Original Issue Date; or (2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.

"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating Agency" means (1) each of Moody's and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Series U Notes or fails to make a rating of the Series U Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Corporation's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-l(e)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Corporation (as certified by a resolution of the Corporation's board of directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in Rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event set forth above) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in Rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding, on behalf of the holders of Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
provided, however,
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series U Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Series U Note at the times and place and at the rate and in the currency herein prescribed.

No service charge shall be
 
made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the holder of this Series U Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Series U Notes, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Series U Notes at the time outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Series U Notes at the time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the holder of this Series U Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
Prior to due presentment of this Series U Note for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Series U Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Series U Note be overdue and notwithstanding the notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the security registrar, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or any premium or the interest on this Series U Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, affiliate, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Corporation or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Series U Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations therein and herein set forth, Series U Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series U Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Series U Note or Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Corporation.
This Series U Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Louisiana.
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
