As of the previously announced early tender date and time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 16, 2012 (the "Early Tender Date"), approximately $1.14 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.

MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink (CenturyLink, Inc., NYSE: CTL)
The table below sets forth, for each series of Notes, among other things, the Reference Yield, the Tender Offer Consideration, the Full Tender Offer Consideration, the maximum tender amount and the aggregate principal amount validly tendered and not withdrawn by the Early Tender Date:
 
 
The Reference Yields listed in the table above were determined by Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the lead dealer managers for the Offer, based on the bid-side prices for the applicable U.S. Treasury reference securities listed in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, today, as described in the Offer to Purchase dated March 5, 2012 (the "Offer to Purchase").
Holders of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the "Full Tender Offer Consideration" listed in the table above, and holders who validly tender Notes after such time but at or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive the "Tender Offer Consideration" listed in the table above. In addition, payments for Notes purchased will include accrued interest up to, but not including, the anticipated settlement date, which is expected to be April 2, 2012. Withdrawal rights for the Offer expired today at 5:00 p.m., New York City time.
As explained further in the Offer to Purchase, Embarq will accept for purchase only $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes. In addition, the amount of each series of Notes that may be accepted for purchase will be determined in accordance with the acceptance priority levels set forth in the table above. All Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn of the series with acceptance priority level 1 will be accepted before any Notes of the series with acceptance priority level 2. If there are sufficient remaining funds to purchase some, but not all, of the Notes of a particular series based on the applicable acceptance priority level, the amount of Notes purchased in that series will be accepted on a pro rata basis as further described in the Offer to Purchase.
The consummation of the Offer is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
This press release is neither an offer to purchase, nor a solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities. Embarq is making the Offer only by, and pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the Offer to Purchase. The complete terms and conditions of the Offer are set forth in the Offer to Purchase and related letter of transmittal previously furnished to holders of Notes. Holders are urged to read the tender offer documents carefully.
