As of the Expiration Date, approximately $1.14 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, and as of today Embarq accepted for purchase all of these Notes in exchange for aggregate tender offer consideration of approximately $1.30 billion, including accrued interest.
The table below sets forth, for each series of Notes, among other things, the Tender Offer Consideration, the Full Tender Offer Consideration and the aggregate principal amount validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Date based on information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary and information agent for the Offer:
 
 
Holders of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date received the "Full Tender Offer Consideration" listed in the table above, and holders who validly tendered Notes after such time but at or prior to the Expiration Date received the "Tender Offer Consideration" listed in the table above. In addition, payments for all Notes purchased included accrued interest up to, but not including, today's settlement date.
CenturyLink expects to record in the first quarter of 2012 a one-time pre-tax charge to net income between $141 million to $144 million related to premiums paid to tendering holders of Notes and estimated transaction costs associated with the Offer.
Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as the lead dealer managers for the Offer.

Any such future purchases may be on the same terms or on terms that are more or less favorable to holders of Notes than the terms of the Offer.
