Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 6, 2012, CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") among CenturyLink, the lenders named therein, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other agents named therein. The Credit Facility amends and restates CenturyLink's Four-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of January 19, 2011, to, among other things, increase the aggregate principal amount available under the facility from $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion, and extend the maturity date of the facility from January 2015 to April 2017. As of April 6, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility (or the predecessor 2011 facility).
The Credit Facility allows CenturyLink to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400 million of letters of credit, which reduce the amount available for other extensions of credit. As of April 6, 2012, the Credit Facility had 18 lenders, with commitments ranging from $2.5 million to $177 million.
Under the Credit Facility, interest will be assessed on future borrowings using either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the base rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.25% to 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.25% to 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on CenturyLink's then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Under the Credit Facility, CenturyLink is obligated to pay customary commitment and letter of credit fees.
Pursuant to a related guarantee agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement"), CenturyLink's obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Embarq Corporation and Qwest Communications International Inc. ("QCII"), and one of QCII's wholly-owned subsidiaries. CenturyLink's obligations under the Credit Facility may be guaranteed by other of CenturyLink's subsidiaries upon the occurrence of certain events further described in the Credit Facility.
CenturyLink's ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is conditioned upon its continued compliance with various covenants, including (i) covenants that restrict CenturyLink's ability to engage in certain asset sales, mergers or other fundamental changes or to incur liens and (ii) financial covenants that stipulate that CenturyLink shall not permit the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated EBITDA to exceed 4.0 to 1.0 and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to the sum of consolidated interest expense and preferred stock dividends to be less than 1.5 to 1.0 (with the above terms and ratios having the meanings and being calculated in the manner stipulated in the Credit Facility). CenturyLink's obligation to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon specified events of default, including failures to make payments when due, defaults of obligations under certain other debt, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, commencement of bankruptcy proceedings and certain other failures to discharge specified obligations or comply with specified laws.
Certain of the lenders and the agents (or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates) under the Credit Facility have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, underwriting, lending, commercial banking, trust or other advisory services to CenturyLink or its subsidiaries. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from CenturyLink or its subsidiaries for such services.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Facility and the Guarantee Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Facility and the Guarantee Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, to this current report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Pro Rata Treatment.
Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, each payment or prepayment of principal and each payment of interest with respect to a Borrowing shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans extended by each Lender, if any, with respect to such Borrowing, and conversions of Loans to Loans of another Type and continuations of Loans that are LIBOR Loans from one Interest Period, shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
2.14.
Sharing of Setoffs.
Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim against the Borrower, including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Loans held by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12) as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Loans held by it shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans held by any other Lender, it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from such other Lender a participation in the Loans held by such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and participations in Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of the Loans held by it prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim; , , that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.14 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be

however
 
recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in Loans deemed to have been so purchased may, upon the existence of an Event of Default, exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
2.15.
Payments.
(a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 10.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

2.16.
Calculation of LIBOR Rate.
The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the LIBOR Rate are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a LIBOR Loan as it sees fit. All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained funding of each LIBOR Loan through the purchase in the London interbank market of one or more eurodollar deposits, in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan and having a maturity corresponding to the Interest Period for such Loan.
2.17.
Computation of Interest and Fees.
(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to (i) Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate and (ii) Commitment Fees payable pursuant to Section 2.4(a), such calculations shall be made on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.7(a).
2.18.
Booking Loans.
Any Lender may make, carry, or transfer Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices, subject to Section 2.24(a).
2.19.
Quotation of Rates.
It is hereby acknowledged that the Borrower may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which notice of a Borrowing is to be delivered by the Borrower in order to receive an indication of the rate or rates then in effect, but that such projection shall not be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender nor affect the rate of interest which thereafter is actually in effect when the election is made.
2.20.
Taxes.
(a) All payments made by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
 
Tribunal, excluding (i) income or franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) net income, in each case, imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Paper) and (ii) any United States federal withholding tax imposed by reason of FATCA as a result of a Lender's failure to comply with the requirements thereof to establish an exemption from withholding thereunder. If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Paper, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement as if such deduction or withholding had not been made, , , that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (x) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (y) that are United States federal withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.
Non-Excluded Taxes

(b) In addition, the Loan Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Tribunal in accordance with applicable Law.
(c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Loan Party showing payment thereof. If a Loan Party fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
(d) Each Lender (or transferee) that is a "United States Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly executed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax. Each Lender (or transferee) that is not a "United States Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) (i) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI, or Form W-8IMY (together with any applicable underlying IRS forms) properly completed and duly executed claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit I and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, or (iii)
Non-U.S. Lender
 
any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this clause that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; , that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
provided
(f) To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Tribunal asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Paper or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (f).
(g) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall pay over such refund to the applicable Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Tribunal with respect to such refund); , that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Tribunal) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Tribunal. This clause shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.

(h) The agreements in this Section 2.20 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

During the Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Swingline Loans shall be Base Rate Loans only.

Not later than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by the Swingline Lender.

plus
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing L/C Lender only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.1 for so long as such L/C Obligations are outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations during the period such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.4 and 3.3 shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Percentages; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then,

If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing L/C Lender has definitive evidence that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit (unless as a result of a good faith dispute), the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing L/C Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing L/C Lender, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing L/C Lender, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder, unless the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders are, at all times while any of the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) above are in existence, sufficient to cover the Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing L/C Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Commitment and L/C Obligations of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage, and shall pay all costs resulting from its becoming a Defaulting Lender.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this clause may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing L/C Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing L/C Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans. A certificate of the Issuing L/C Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

amount of the Commitments in respect of such non-terminating tranches at such time (it being understood that (1) the participations therein of Lenders under the maturing tranche shall be correspondingly released and (2) no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (B) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (A), but without limiting the obligations with respect thereto, the Borrower shall cash collateralize or backstop any such Letter of Credit in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing L/C Lender. If, for any reason, such
cash collateral or backstop is not provided or the reallocation does not occur, the Lenders under the maturing tranche shall continue to be responsible for their participating interests in the Letters of Credit; that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon any subsequent repayment of the Loans, the reallocation set forth in clause (A) shall automatically and concurrently occur to the extent of such repayment (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated). Except to the extent of reallocations of participations pursuant to clause (A) of the second preceding sentence, the occurrence of a maturity date with respect to a given tranche of Commitments shall have no effect upon (and shall not diminish) the percentage participations of the Lenders in any Letter of Credit issued before such maturity date. Commencing with the maturity date of any tranche of Commitments, the sublimit for Letters of Credit under any tranche of Commitments that has not so then matured shall be as agreed with such Lenders; that in no event shall such sublimit be less than the sum of (x) the L/C Obligations of the Lenders under such extended tranche immediately prior to such maturity date and (y) the face amount of the Letters of Credit reallocated to such tranche of Commitments pursuant to clause (A) of the second preceding sentence above (assuming Loans are repaid in accordance with clause (A)(x)).

Remedies Upon Event of Default.

(b) Should any other Event of Default occur and be continuing, subject to any agreement among the Lenders, the Administrative Agent may (and shall upon the request of the Majority Lenders), at its (or the Majority Lenders') election, do any one or more of the following: (i) If the maturity of the Obligation has not already been accelerated under Section 9.1(a), declare the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation (including all amounts of L/C Obligations, whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required thereunder), or any part thereof, immediately due and payable, whereupon it shall be due and payable (and notice of such declaration shall promptly be given thereafter by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower); (ii) terminate commitments to make Loans hereunder; (iii) reduce any claim to judgment; (iv) exercise (or request each Lender to exercise) the Rights of offset or banker's Lien against the interest of the Borrower in and to every account and other property of the Borrower which are in the possession of any Lender to the extent of the full amount of the Obligation; and (v) exercise any and all other legal or equitable Rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the Right to bring suit or other proceedings before any Tribunal either for specific performance of any covenant or condition contained in any of the Loan Papers or in aid of the exercise of any Right granted to the Lenders in any of the Loan Papers. With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit,
 
and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrower hereunder. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations of the Borrower hereunder shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be returned to the Borrower (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled thereto).

Waivers.
The Borrower hereby waives presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, and notice of protest and nonpayment, and agrees that its liability with respect to the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment of the Obligation, by any indulgence, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of the Obligation.

If any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company is not performed in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers, the Administrative Agent may, at its option (but subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders), perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of such Company. In such event, any amount expended by the Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance shall be reasonable, payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on demand, shall become part of the Obligation, and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of such expenditure by the Administrative Agent until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that the Administrative Agent does not assume and shall never have, except by its express written consent, any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company.
9.4.
Delegation of Duties and Rights.

Lenders Not in Control.
None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Paper shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Agents or the Lenders the Right to exercise control over the assets (including, without limitation, real property), affairs, or management of any Company, the power of the Agents and the Lenders being limited to the Right to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 9.
9.6.
Waivers by Lenders.
The acceptance by the Agents or the Lenders at any time and from time to time of partial payment on the Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of Default then existing. No waiver by the Agents, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders of any Event of Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other then-existing or subsequent Event of Default. No delay or omission by the Agents, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders in exercising any Right under the Loan Papers shall impair such Right or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such Right preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other Right under the Loan Papers or otherwise.
 
9.7.
Cumulative Rights.
All Rights available to the Agents and the Lenders under the Loan Papers are cumulative of and in addition to all other Rights granted to the Agents and the Lenders at law or in equity, whether or not the Obligation is due and payable and whether or not the Agents or the Lenders have instituted any suit for collection, foreclosure, or other action in connection with the Loan Papers.

Application of Proceeds.
Any and all proceeds ever received by the Agents or the Lenders from the exercise of any Rights pertaining to the Obligation shall be applied to the Obligations in the order and manner set forth in Section 2.15.

Certain Proceedings.
The Borrower will promptly execute and deliver or cause the execution and delivery of, all applications, certificates, instruments, registration statements, and all other documents and papers the Agents or the Lenders may reasonably request in connection with the obtaining of any consent, approval, registration, qualification, permit, license, or authorization of any other Tribunal or other Person necessary or appropriate for the effective exercise of any Rights under the Loan Papers. Because the Borrower agrees that the Agents' and the Lenders' remedies at Law for failure of the Borrower to comply with the provisions of this paragraph would be inadequate and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, the Borrower agrees that the covenants of this paragraph may be specifically enforced.
9.10.
Setoff.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower (any such notice being hereby expressly waived by the Borrower), to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any portion of the Obligation owing to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not all of the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall be then due. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) after any such setoff and application; , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

No Subrogation

When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its Rights hereunder against any Guarantor, any Guaranteed Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such Rights as it may have against the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of setoff with respect thereto, and any failure by any Guaranteed Party to make any such demand, to pursue such other Rights or to collect any payments from the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of setoff, or any release of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of setoff, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the Rights, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any Guaranteed Party against any Guarantor.

Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the relevant Guarantor (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) after any such setoff and application; that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
