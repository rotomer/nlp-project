or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any LIBOR Loan made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) in respect thereof by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increase or reduction to such Lender, to the extent such amounts have not been included in the calculation of the LIBOR Rate, upon demand by such Lender (through the Administrative Agent).

The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after its receipt of the same; that the Borrower shall not be required to pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10 for any amount specified in clause (a) or (b) above in respect of a period occurring more than 180 days prior to the date on which such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Regulatory Change and such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor, except, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to any amount specified in clause (a) or (b) above is retroactive, no such time limitation shall apply so long as such Lender requests compensation within 180 days from the date on which the applicable Tribunal informed such Lender of such Regulatory Change. In preparing such certificate, such Lender may employ such assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in good faith deem reasonable and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution method.

Change in Legality.
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if any Regulatory Change shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:
(i) declare that LIBOR Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon the Borrower shall be prohibited from requesting LIBOR Loans from such Lender hereunder unless such declaration is subsequently withdrawn; and
(ii) if such unlawfulness shall be effective prior to the end of any Interest Period of an outstanding LIBOR Loan, require that all outstanding LIBOR Loans with such Interest Periods made by it be converted to Base Rate Loans, in which event (A) all such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below and (B) all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted LIBOR Loans shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans resulting from the conversion of such LIBOR Loans.
(b) For purposes of this Section 2.11, a notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt thereof by the Borrower.

Indemnity.
The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Pro Rata Treatment.
Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, each payment or prepayment of principal and each payment of interest with respect to a Borrowing shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans extended by each Lender with respect to such Borrowing, and conversions of Loans to Loans of another Type and continuations of Loans that are LIBOR Loans from one Interest Period, shall be made pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Term Percentages.
 
2.14.
Sharing of Setoffs.
Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim against the Borrower, including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Loans held by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12) as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Loans held by it shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans held by any other Lender, it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from such other Lender a participation in the Loans held by such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and participations in Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of the Loans held by it prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim; , , that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.14 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation in Loans deemed to have been so purchased may, upon the existence of an Event of Default, exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff, or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

2.15.
Payments.
(a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 9.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to the borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Closing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the
 
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Closing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

2.16.
Calculation of LIBOR Rate.
The provisions of this Agreement relating to calculation of the LIBOR Rate are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or other amounts to be paid hereunder that are based upon such rate, it being understood that each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of a LIBOR Loan as it sees fit. All such determinations hereunder, however, shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained funding of each LIBOR Loan through the purchase in the London interbank market of one or more eurodollar deposits, in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Loan and having a maturity corresponding to the Interest Period for such Loan.
2.17.
Computation of Interest and Fees.
(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, such calculations shall be made on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.7(a).
2.18.
Booking Loans.
 
Any Lender may make, carry, or transfer Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices, subject to Section 2.21(a).
2.19.
Taxes.
(a) All payments made by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Tribunal, excluding (i) income or franchise taxes imposed on (or measured by) net income, in each case, imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Paper) and (ii) any United States federal withholding tax imposed by reason of FATCA as a result of a Lender's failure to comply with the requirements thereof to establish an exemption from withholding thereunder. If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Paper, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement as if such deduction or withholding had not been made, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (x) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (y) that are United States federal withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.
(b) In addition, the Loan Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Tribunal in accordance with applicable Law.
(c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Loan Party showing payment thereof. If a Loan Party fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
(d) Each Lender (or transferee) that is a "United States Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly executed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax. Each Lender (or transferee) that is not a "United States Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation
Non-U.S. Lender
 
shall have been purchased) (i) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8ECI, or Form W-8IMY (together with any applicable underlying IRS forms) properly completed and duly executed claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, or (iii) any other form prescribed by applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of Law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this clause that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; , that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
provided
(f) To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Tribunal asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.

7.6.
Default Under Other Agreements.
A default exists under any Material Agreement to which any Company is a party, the effect of which is to cause, or which permits the holder thereof (or a trustee or representative of such holder) to cause, unpaid consideration of at least 2% of Consolidated Net Worth (individually or in the aggregate) to become due prior to the stated maturity or prior to the regularly scheduled dates of payment. For the purposes of this paragraph, a default by any Company in the payment of any obligation at its stated maturity date (taking into account any applicable cure period) shall be deemed to have caused such obligation to become due prior to such stated final maturity.
7.7.
Misrepresentation.
The Administrative Agent or any Lender discovers that any statement, representation, or warranty in the Loan Papers, any Financial Statement of the Borrower, or any writing ever delivered to the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to the Loan Papers is false, misleading, or erroneous when made, deemed made or delivered in any material respect.

8.1.
Remedies Upon Event of Default.
(a) Should an Event of Default occur and be continuing under Section 7.3, the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation shall automatically become due and payable without any action of any kind whatsoever.
(b) Should any other Event of Default occur and be continuing, subject to any agreement among the Lenders, the Administrative Agent may (and shall upon the request of the Majority Lenders), at its (or the Majority Lenders') election, do any one or more of the following: (i) If the maturity of the Obligation has not already been accelerated under Section 8.1(a), declare the entire unpaid balance of the Obligation, or any part thereof, immediately due and payable, whereupon it shall be due and payable (and notice of such declaration shall promptly be given thereafter by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower); (ii) reduce any claim to judgment; (iii) exercise (or request each Lender to exercise) the Rights of offset or banker's Lien against the interest of the Borrower in and to every account and other property of the Borrower which are in the possession of any Lender to the extent of the full amount of the Obligation; and (iv) exercise any and all other legal or equitable Rights afforded by the Loan Papers, the Laws of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the Right to bring suit or other proceedings before any Tribunal either for specific performance of any covenant or condition contained in any of the Loan Papers or in aid of the exercise of any Right granted to the Lenders in any of the Loan Papers.
 
8.2.
Waivers.
The Borrower hereby waives presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration, and notice of protest and nonpayment, and agrees that its liability with respect to the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment of the Obligation, by any indulgence, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of the Obligation.
8.3.
Performance by Administrative Agent.
If any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company is not performed in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers, the Administrative Agent may, at its option (but subject to the approval of the Majority Lenders), perform or attempt to perform such covenant, duty, or agreement on behalf of such Company. In such event, any amount expended by the Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance shall be reasonable, payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent on demand, shall become part of the Obligation, and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of such expenditure by the Administrative Agent until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood that the Administrative Agent does not assume and shall never have, except by its express written consent, any liability or responsibility for the performance of any covenant, duty, or agreement of any Company.
8.4.
Delegation of Duties and Rights.
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may perform any of their duties or exercise any of their Rights under the Loan Papers by or through the Administrative Agent and their and the Administrative Agent's officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, or other representatives.
8.5.
Lenders Not in Control.
None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Paper shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Administrative Agent or the Lenders the Right to exercise control over the assets (including, without limitation, real property), affairs, or management of any Company, the power of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders being limited to the Right to exercise the remedies provided in this Section 8.
8.6.
Waivers by Lenders.
The acceptance by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders at any time and from time to time of partial payment on the Obligation shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of Default then existing. No waiver by the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders of any Event of Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other then-existing or subsequent Event of Default. No delay or omission by the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders, or all of the Lenders in exercising any Right under the Loan Papers shall impair such Right or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such Right preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other Right under the Loan Papers or otherwise.
8.7.
Cumulative Rights.
 
All Rights available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Papers are cumulative of and in addition to all other Rights granted to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders at law or in equity, whether or not the Obligation is due and payable and whether or not the Administrative Agent or the Lenders have instituted any suit for collection, foreclosure, or other action in connection with the Loan Papers.

Certain Proceedings.

Because the Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' remedies at Law for failure of the Borrower to comply with the provisions of this paragraph would be inadequate and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, the Borrower agrees that the covenants of this paragraph may be specifically enforced.
8.10.
Setoff.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower (any such notice being hereby expressly waived by the Borrower), to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any portion of the Obligation owing to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not all of the Obligation, or any part thereof, shall be then due. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) after any such setoff and application; , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the
 
Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); , that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Companies and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Companies and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Company or any affiliate of a Company that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the relevant Guarantor (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) after any such setoff and application; that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The Rights of each Lender hereunder are in addition to other Rights (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
