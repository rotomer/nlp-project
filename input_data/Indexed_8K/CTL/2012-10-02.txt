On October 1, 2012, CenturyLink, Inc. issued a press release announcing that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Qwest Communications International Inc., terminated its previously-announced cash tender offer for its outstanding 7.125% Notes due 2018.

(d) Exhibits
The exhibit to this current report on Form 8-K is listed in the Exhibit Index, which appears at the end of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, CenturyLink, Inc. and Qwest Communications International Inc. have duly caused this current report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned officer hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: October 2, 2012
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
announced today that in light of current market conditions it has decided not to proceed with its previously-announced senior notes offering at this time. CenturyLink opportunistically sought to refinance certain indebtedness of its wholly-owned subsidiary Qwest Communications International Inc. ("Qwest") at attractive rates.
MONROE, La. . . . CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE: CTL)
As a result of its decision not to proceed with its senior notes offering, CenturyLink also announced that Qwest is hereby terminating its previously-announced cash tender offer for its outstanding 7.125% Notes due 2018 (CUSIP Number 749121CC1). Qwest is terminating the tender offer because it has determined that the financing condition is unlikely to be satisfied.
Qwest has previously committed to redeem on October 26, 2012 all $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Notes due 2015. Qwest now expects to fund this redemption with borrowings available to it under CenturyLink's revolving credit facility.
This press release constitutes a formal termination of Qwest's tender offer. CenturyLink and Qwest reserve the right to initiate a new tender offer at a later date if market conditions become more favorable, but are under no obligation to do so. Qwest also reserves the right to repurchase from time to time its 7.125% Notes due 2018 through other means, including redemption transactions, but is under no obligation to do so.
This press release is for informational purposes only and constitutes neither an offer to buy nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the above-described notes or any other securities. This press release shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction. Qwest's tender offer was made solely pursuant to the press release issued earlier today by Qwest and CenturyLink.
