"The year 2002 was successful for Cognizant on almost all fronts," said Kumar Mahadeva, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Foremost is our belief that we have firmly established Cognizant in the top tier of our peer group, widening the gap between ourselves and other competitors with the successful execution of our industry leading 4th Generation services model. In addition, we continue to benefit from the broad market acceptance of the offshore delivery model, which will fuel our growth in the years to come. This is best illustrated by the growing number of strategic client partnerships that we established over the course of the year, typically with larger companies that have embraced offshore outsourcing as a part of their own strategic initiatives. The growth opportunities with the many strategic clients we won during 2002 gives us a high degree of confidence in our outlook for 2003, as does the potential opportunities in our new deal pipeline which remains robust." "Cognizant's business model continued to generate strong results, with our year-end cash position rising to over $126 million, which includes the generation of $57 million of cash from operations during
2002," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer. "DSO, including unbilled receivables, improved further to 56 days, from 59 at the end of September and 64 at the end of June. Financial Services customers continue to account for a growing portion of our revenue mix, rising to 43% compared to 35% last quarter due to the ramp-up of several large customers. Total headcount increased to over 6,100, reflecting the strength of our business outlook for 2003. And finally, our existing clients remain highly satisfied as well, accounting for 85% of our business this quarter." CONFERENCE CALL Cognizant will host a conference call on February 12, at 5 PM.
