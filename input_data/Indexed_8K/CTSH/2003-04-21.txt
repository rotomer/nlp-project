"Our 4th Generation business model is focused on partnering with customers to achieve substantial reductions in cost structure while rationalizing and streamlining their applications portfolio to better align with business needs, a process we call "transforming while performing". New clients rapidly ramp up their relationships because Cognizant's business model can quickly deliver substantial business results, and because Cognizant is able to lead clients through the change process."
