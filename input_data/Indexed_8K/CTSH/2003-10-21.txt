"Our pipeline is the strongest it has ever been, and we are optimistic about our prospects for the future. Cognizant's focus remains on investing in the business to further differentiate ourselves from the competition. We continue to deepen our domain expertise, and introduce new service offerings. For example, our "transforming while performing" service has gained strong traction and allows us to ramp up client business faster, and build more strategic client relationships than our competition. Cognizant's strategy is facilitated by our locally based senior practice head and client partner approach, through which we can be highly responsive, and develop strong and lasting client partnerships. We believe that Cognizant's business model and execution capabilities are the best in the industry."
"We are optimistic about the growth prospects for the remainder of the year and 2004, and anticipate Cognizant delivering continued revenue and earnings momentum and maintaining stable operating margin and pricing levels," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer.
