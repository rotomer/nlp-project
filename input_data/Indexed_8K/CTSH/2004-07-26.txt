Teaneck, NJ  July 26, 2004  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT services, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Highlights for the second quarter include:
Revenue for the second quarter increased to $138.7 million, up 16% from $119.7 million in the first quarter of 2004, and up 59% from $87.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter increased to $23.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $19.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share (on a split-adjusted basis) in the first quarter of 2004. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 20.0%, compared to 19.8% in the first quarter of 2004 and 19.6% in the second quarter of 2003.
"The second quarter was exceptionally strong as we reported substantially better than expected results with solid growth across all of our key verticals," stated Lakshmi Narayanan, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Application development services continued to show strong momentum, growing 77% year-over-year as a result of Cognizant's success at winning complex development projects. Our focus on building long-term customer relationships has led to increased client penetration and opportunities to cross-sell our services to existing and new strategic customers, enabling Cognizant to grow faster than any of our peers in the industry. Additionally, approximately 90% of revenue came from clients with whom we have worked for at least one year. We also continue to strengthen our position as a highly differentiated provider of offshore outsourcing services as reflected in our ongoing ability to broaden and deepen our relationships with existing clients while maintaining a high win-rate against our competitors."
 
2004 Outlook
"In addition to our strong revenue and margin performance during the quarter, we are particularly pleased with our cash flow metrics, including a decline in DSO to 59 days and generation of over $30 million of cash from operations," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant. "Based on the strength of our new business pipeline and the continuing interest from prospective customers, we remain very optimistic about our growth opportunities for the remainder of 2004 and believe that Cognizant is well-positioned to benefit from its leadership position and the ongoing momentum in the offshore outsourcing market."
