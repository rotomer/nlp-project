"We are pleased with Cognizant's strong results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2004, which outpaced the performance of the industry overall," said Lakshmi Narayanan, President and CEO of Cognizant. "We attribute our growth to a number of factors, all of which reflect the success of our focus on providing customers with business-driven technology solutions through our onsite, offshore model. In the fourth quarter, we continued to expand existing client relationships through cross-selling an ever increasing range of high value services. We also experienced continued traction within Europe, as well as strong growth overall across our financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail verticals."
Business Highlights
Cognizant added over 1,300 associates in the fourth quarter, ending the year with approximately 15,300 employees  an increase of over 6,000 for the full year. These hires include engineering graduates, MBA's, senior level architects and program managers. Construction on close to one million square feet of additional facilities has also moved ahead and is on schedule.
"In 2004 we delivered a number of highly complex projects to clients who engaged Cognizant to help them solve major business challenges with the strategic application of IT solutions," continued Mr. Narayanan. "To address this demand, we introduced several new service offerings over the course of the year. This includes our previously announced Technology Consulting and Advanced Solutions Group, which offers domain, technology and enterprise application expertise to help clients extend, enhance, and leverage new and existing IT investments. Additionally, we introduced our industry-leading testing service, which focuses exclusively on supporting our clients' testing needs through independent verification and validation of their internal software. Our significant number of strategic clients and enhanced service offerings allowed us to build upon our strong momentum and extend our platform for growth in 2005 and beyond."
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
2005 Outlook  First Quarter & Full Year
"In addition to our strong revenue and margin performance during 2004, we are particularly pleased with our cash flow metrics, including the generation of over $120 million of cash from operations during the year," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant. "This resulted in a year-end DSO of 59 days and a cash and short-term deposit balance of over $314 million."
"Our 60% revenue growth in the fourth quarter is a clear indication that we are consistently growing faster than our competition," added Mr. Coburn. "We continue to enhance our high level of business execution quality by accelerating reinvestment in the Company. Our recruitment and training programs continue to ramp at a rapid pace, and, as a result of our ongoing investment in infrastructure and the recruitment and training of our highly skilled staff, Cognizant is well positioned for strong performance in both the first quarter and full year of 2005. Based on the current demand environment, we anticipate a 50% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter to $180 million, and anticipate full year revenue to top $845 million."
