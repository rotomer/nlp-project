On December 22, 2005, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), completed the repatriation of approximately $60 million of earnings of its foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Company expects to record a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $12 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as a result of the repatriation. The impact of this reduction in income tax expense is incremental to the Company's previously stated earnings guidance.
