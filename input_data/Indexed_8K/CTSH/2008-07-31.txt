Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  July 31, 2008  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT and business process outsourcing services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Highlights  Second Quarter 2008
 
 
 
Revenue for the quarter increased to $685.4 million, up 6.6% sequentially from $643.1 million in the first quarter of 2008, and up 33% from $516.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $103.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $82.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, in line with the Company's targeted 19 to 20% range. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace, we exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Several of our business segments, including Financial Services, performed well during the quarter. Furthermore, we generated continued strong performance across Europe and healthy growth from our Business/Knowledge Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services practices as a result of clients' focusing on cost efficiencies."
"Due to the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and sagging consumer and business confidence, we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects given that our pipeline of large deals remains healthy, our market position remains strong and the trend towards increasing offshore spending continues, driven by secular changes in industry dynamics, pressures to find cost efficiencies or, in some cases, both."
2008 Outlook  Third Quarter & Full Year
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
"Although we are disappointed with the necessity of reducing our outlook for the second half of the year due to the weakening economy, we are pleased to continue our expectation of industry leading growth and a healthy long-term outlook for the business," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "We continue to invest across the markets we serve, deepening our consulting and domain capabilities and expanding our services offerings in areas such as Business/Knowledge Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services in order to extend our leading competitive position. At the same time, we are focused on managing our expenses and increasing utilization in order to optimize our operating performance while we invest for the long term success of the business."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management
reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
