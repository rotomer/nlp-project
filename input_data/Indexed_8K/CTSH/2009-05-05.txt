Exhibit 99.1
 
Teaneck, NJ  May 5, 2009  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services, today announced its first quarter 2009 financial results.
Highlights  First Quarter 2009
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2009 rose to $745.9 million, up 16% from $643.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. GAAP net income was $113.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared to $101.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.41. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.5%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $11.8 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, above the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Earnings for the quarter included $5 million, or $0.01 per share, of non-operating foreign currency exchange losses primarily resulting from the weakness in the European currencies and Indian Rupee during the period. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are pleased with our performance during the first quarter which exceeded our revenue guidance and demonstrated Cognizant's continued ability to outperform the industry," said Francisco D'Souza,
President and CEO of Cognizant. "Cognizant's performance this quarter once again demonstrates the value of our long standing approach of continued reinvestment in our business. In the current economic downturn, as our clients face fundamental structural changes within their industries, they are looking for a partner that brings industry insight, consulting expertise, intellectual capital and world class thinking to the table. At Cognizant we understand the challenges our clients face. We help them navigate change to address these challenges. Our continuing strategy of reinvesting in our business to deepen our expertise, experience and ultimately, our value proposition, has meant we remain the trusted advisor to our customers in good times and bad, continuing our industry leading growth trajectory."
Mr. D'Souza continued: "Looking to the full year, we remain confident of achieving our full year guidance of at least 10% revenue growth. We will continue to adhere to our business strategy and strategically manage our way through the current market turmoil to capture new opportunities so that we can emerge from this downturn in an even stronger position than when we entered it."

"During the quarter, we continued to focus on operational excellence, thus generating cost savings which can be reinvested in differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and generating industry-leading long-term revenue growth," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "In addition, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and ended the quarter with approximately $969 million in cash, short-term and long-term investments.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
