Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)  Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On Monday, July 6, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") approved forms of award agreements and notices for use by the Company in connection with restricted stock unit awards and stock option grants under the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (or by the Board or such other committee with authority to grant awards under the Plan) at the time of grant, all awards granted pursuant to the Plan will be subject to the terms of the standard form agreements summarized below, in addition to the terms set forth in the Plan. The term "Plan Administrator," as used herein, means our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee or any other committee, to the extent each such entity is acting within the scope of its administrative authority under the Plan.
Form of Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Stock Option Agreement
Each option will have an exercise price per share determined by the Plan Administrator, but the exercise price will not be less than one hundred percent of the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date.
Each option will vest and become exercisable for twenty-five percent of the option shares upon the optionee's completion of each year of service over the four year period measured from the option grant date. Each option will automatically accelerate in full upon a change in control, unless that award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting schedule in effect for that award.
Each option will have a maximum term of seven years. Upon cessation of service, each optionee will have a limited period of time in which to exercise his or her outstanding option to the extent exercisable for vested shares.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Time-Based Vesting
Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the date that unit vests. The shares in which the participant vests will be issued on the applicable vesting date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Company's collection of applicable withholding taxes.
Each restricted stock unit award will vest in accordance with one of the following two standard vesting schedules: (i) in a series of three successive equal annual installments upon the participant's completion of each successive year of active service over the three year period measured from the award date and (ii) in a series of twelve successive equal quarterly installments upon the participant's completion of each successive calendar quarter of active service over the three year period measured from the award date. Each restricted stock unit award will vest in full upon a change in control, unless that award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting and issuance schedule in effect for that award.
 
Phantom dividend equivalents will accrue for each outstanding restricted stock unit and will be distributed to the participant (in cash or such other form as determined by the Plan administrator) at the time the vested shares to which those dividend equivalents relate are issued, subject to the Company's collection of applicable withholding taxes.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Performance-Based Vesting
The terms of each restricted stock unit with performance based vesting will be substantially similar to the terms described above for restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting. However, instead of a time-based vesting schedule, the units will vest on the basis of the attainment of performance objectives determined by the Plan Administrator during a performance period with a duration of at least one year, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Non-Employee Director Deferred Issuance
Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the date that unit vests. The shares in which the non-employee director vests will be issued on the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the date of the non-employee director's separation from service, (ii) the closing date of a change in control transaction, (iii) the date of the non-employee director's death and (iv) the date of the non-employee director's permanent disability.
Restricted stock units will vest in a series of successive equal annual, quarterly or monthly installments upon the non-employee director's completion of each successive year, quarter or month of active service measured from the award date, as determined by the Plan Administrator at the time of grant. Each restricted stock unit will vest in full upon a change in control, unless the award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting and issuance schedule in effect for the award.
Phantom dividend equivalents will accrue for each outstanding restricted stock unit and will be distributed to the non-employee director (in cash or such other form as determined by the Plan Administrator) at the time the vested shares to which those dividend equivalents relate are issued.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the form agreements and notices and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.8 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(b) No installment under this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option if (and to the extent) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which such installment first becomes exercisable hereunder would, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or any other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate.

(c) Should the exercisability of this option be accelerated upon a Change in Control, then this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option only to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which this option first becomes exercisable in the calendar year in which the Change in Control transaction occurs does not, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or one or more other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in the calendar year of such Change in Control, the option may nevertheless be exercised for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option.
(d) Should Optionee hold, in addition to this option, one or more other options to purchase Common Stock which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year as this option, then for purposes of the foregoing limitations on the exercisability of such options as Incentive Options, this option and each of those other options shall be deemed to become first exercisable in that calendar year, on the basis of the chronological order in which such options were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under applicable law or regulation.
