FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., February 7, 2011  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results.
Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2010
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010 rose to $1.31 billion, up 45.2% from $902.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. GAAP net income was $206.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $144.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.70. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.7%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $14.9 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, in line with the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are pleased with how quickly our business rebounded during 2010  a validation of our strategy of continuing to invest through the downturn," said Francisco D'Souza, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant. "As our clients continue to recover from the recent economic turmoil, it's clear that our industry stands at yet another inflection point. Clients increasingly turn to us as they look to outsource a broader range of services and simultaneously address the secular and technological shifts impacting their industries. We believe that these trends, and our resilience in meeting them, should provide strong support for growth as we enter 2011."

Revenue for 2010 increased to $4.59 billion, up 40.1% from $3.28 billion for 2009. GAAP net income was $733.5 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, compared to $535.0 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, for 2009. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $2.51. GAAP operating margin was 18.8%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $57.0 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.0%. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included in the table at the end of this release.

"Strong investments in our people, processes and infrastructure have allowed us to provide increasing value to our clients, while generating industry-leading growth," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "Our intense focus on operational excellence continues to pay off. We crossed the 100,000 employee mark in the fourth quarter, while at the same time driving attrition levels down. In addition, strong cash collections helped drive an increase in cash and short-term investments of almost $300 million during the quarter to a total of over $2.2 billion."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax that was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to April 1, 2009. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
