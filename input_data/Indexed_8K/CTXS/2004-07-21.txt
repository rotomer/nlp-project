(Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. Revenues for the second quarter of 2004 were $178.3 million, compared to $143.0 million in the same period of the prior year, representing a 24.6 percent increase. Deferred revenue grew to $193.8 million, compared to $128.2 million in the same period of the prior year, representing an increase of 51.2 percent. GAAP Results Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $31.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $29.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Adjusted Results Net income, adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, was $35.4 million for the second quarter of 2004, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $31.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. "We delivered an excellent quarter with double-digit revenue growth, strong deferred revenue growth, solid performance from the Citrix Online Division, and continued momentum in our Subscription Advantage business," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Overall, I believe our results demonstrate that we are executing well in elevating access from a tactical component of information technology to a strategic element of business." Q2 2004 Financial Highlights -- Citrix closed five customer agreements worth more than $1 million; all 10 of the top 10 agreements were greater than $500,000. -- By segment, Americas revenue grew 11 percent; EMEA revenue grew 21 percent; and APAC revenue grew 43 percent compared to last year. -- License revenue was flat sequentially and down 5 percent compared to last year. -- License update revenue was up 14 percent sequentially and up 69 percent compared to last year. -- Services revenue, excluding Citrix Online, was up 8 percent sequentially and up 16 percent over last year. -- Citrix Online revenue was $10.5 million for the quarter, the company's first full quarter of combined operations. -- Operating margin was 21 percent for the quarter; operating margin adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets was 24 percent. -- Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $45 million, compared to $54 million last year. Financial Outlook Citrix management offers the following expectations for the quarter ending September 30, 2004: -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million -- GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.19 -- Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the effect of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, is expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.21 The financial outlook statements above are based on current expectations and these statements are forward-looking. The actual results may differ materially. Customer Highlights Citrix closed several large customer agreements during the quarter, including France Telecom, London Borough of Haringey, and US Air Force Personnel Command. France Telecom, one of the world's leading telecommunications carriers with 118.6 million customers on five continents, continued its rollout of Citrix access infrastructure with the implementation of more than 14,000 additional seats of Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Presentation Server. This expansion of the Citrix deployment enables secure, easy and instant access to business-critical applications, including SAP, Vantive and many applications geared specifically to the telecommunications industry, regardless of location or network connection. Haringey, one of London's 32 boroughs, has licensed 3,800 Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server seats. With Citrix access infrastructure, Haringey will provide managed access to shared resources, allowing borough employees to securely access more than 70 Microsoft(R) and proprietary applications used daily in the ongoing management and development of the borough. US Air Force Personnel Command has implemented 5,000 licenses of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server and MetaFrame Password Manager to facilitate centralized and cost-effective application deployment and ensure the security of its network. With Citrix access infrastructure, the US Air Force Personnel Command benefits from secure, easy and instant access to its Oracle human resources applications. Citrix Online Since its acquisition on March 1, 2004, the Citrix Online business has performed on plan and has generated excitement from Citrix's customer base. Beginning this quarter, Citrix will take the next step in its plan to integrate Citrix Online and further leverage the Citrix brand, channel partners and installed base for its new service-based products. In conjunction with the next phase of the integration process, Andreas von Blottnitz, who has successfully led Citrix Online for the past five years, will be leaving Citrix in the fourth quarter. von Blottnitz sees this new phase of integration as the best time for a smooth transition. Brett Caine, senior vice president of sales for Citrix Online, will assume the responsibilities of president beginning August 1, 2004. von Blottnitz will continue to consult with the company to ensure a smooth transition through October 1, 2004. Caine has successfully run sales for Citrix Online for the past year, helping the business reach its sales goals and providing additional operational discipline. Caine will report to John Burris, senior vice president of worldwide sales and services for Citrix. "Brett has delivered outstanding results since joining the division," said Klaus Schauser, founder and chief technology officer for Citrix Online. "Brett has the full support of the management team in Santa Barbara as well as the executive team at Citrix to lead the division and drive a smooth hand-off. We look forward to much closer sales and marketing coordination to gain partner and customer synergy and leverage." Product Highlights During the second quarter, Citrix introduced MetaFrame Access Suite 3.0, delivering to customers a complete and integrated access infrastructure solution. This new version of the MetaFrame Access Suite delivers security, mobility, flexibility, productivity and performance, including the comprehensive management of MetaFrame Presentation Server, the mobility and flexibility benefits of MetaFrame Secure Access Manager, the single sign-on (SSO) and password security offered by MetaFrame Password Manager, and the collaborative resources of MetaFrame Conferencing Manager. One of the most important advances of the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite 3.0 is SmoothRoaming, a new capability that ensures consistent mobile access that is always on, and allows computing environments to follow users across locations, devices and access outages. In other product news of the quarter, the popular products of the Citrix Online Division continued to draw industry accolades. In April, Citrix GoToMyPC(R) Corporate was chosen as a finalist in eWeek's Excellence Awards program in the Personal Productivity category. The finalists were selected from hundreds of high-quality entries by teams composed of eWeek Labs analysts, eWeek Corporate Partners, and senior IT professionals who represent eWeek's readers. Citrix GoToMyPC also received PC World's 2004 World Class Award for best remote-access software for the second consecutive year, clearly establishing itself as the market leader in the Web-based remote access software category for its fast, easy and secure access to desktop PCs. Additionally, Citrix GoToAssist(TM) earned top distinctions from Customer Interaction Solutions magazine, which awarded GoToAssist the 2004 CRM Excellence Award, and CRM Advocate, which named GoToAssist the winner in The Sixth Annual Users Choice Awards in the service and support category.
