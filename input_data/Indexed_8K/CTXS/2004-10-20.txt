The city government of Madrid, Spain, Ayuntamiento de Madrid, licensed 1,500 seats of the Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Access Suite, including the MetaFrame Presentation Server component product. Informatica del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, via Citrix access infrastructure, will provide its municipal workers with secure, easy and instant access to enterprise applications such as SAP, no matter where they are located, from anywhere, at anytime, using any device, over any connection. Computer Associates International Inc., (CA) one of the world's largest management software companies, selected Citrix GoToAssist(TM) to enable it to deliver secure, on-demand, remote technical-support service to millions of customers around the world. With industry-leading Citrix GoToAssist, CA has increased productivity, reduced backlog and the time required to resolve issues, and significantly enhanced customer satisfaction. The German Armed Forces selected Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server for highly secure access to mission-critical applications. To manage the transfer of confidential information, the German Armed Forces needed a solution that would enhance the customized security solutions it already had in place in which no active content is delivered through the Local Area Network (LAN) or wireless connection. By licensing 4,000 seats of the MetaFrame Presentation Server, a number of German Armed Forces personnel can now have secure, reliable, on-demand access to the required applications. Huawei Technologies, headquartered in Shenzhen, China and specializing in R&D, production and marketing of telecom equipment, customized network solutions in fixed, mobile, optical and data communications networks, has licensed 1,000 seats of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server.

Junta de Andalucia - Servicio Andaluz de la Salud, a regional healthcare organization serving Andalucia, Spain, licensed 2,600 Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server and MetaFrame Password Manager seats. With Citrix access infrastructure, Junta de Andalucia will continue to enhance its consistent track record of excellent patient care by providing its healthcare employees with fast, company-wide access to a variety of critical office and medical applications. Located in Syracuse, N.Y., the Syracuse City School District currently oversees 38 individual schools, ranging from elementary to high school grade levels. The Syracuse City School District holds a common set of core values, which include excellence in learning and teaching, cultural diversity and public accountability. The district is also actively committed to utilizing technology advancements to improve the learning environment for its vast student body. To ensure that its facility and administrative staff have convenient, secure access to applications like their student information systems, Syracuse City School District licensed 2,500 seats of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server. Product and Alliance Highlights During the third quarter, Citrix and SAP announced that Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server will be offered for SAP upgrades in North America, which will result in faster upgrades, increased productivity, and reduced costs. During the quarter, Citrix and Siebel reported that Citrix joined the Siebel Alliance Program as one of only five elite Siebel Strategic Platform Partners.
