Annual revenues for 2004 were $741 million, compared to $589 million in the previous year, a 26 percent increase. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $52 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $36 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

"In the quarter, we saw double-digit software license revenue growth over last year's fourth quarter; license revenue from new products reached the high end of our target range; and we experienced very strong sequential growth in EMEA. "For the year, we saw strength in three key areas: in our subscription business, our new products, and in our core enterprise business. In addition, we executed well, maintaining our adjusted operating margins in the desired range of mid-to-upper 20 percent while investing for the future. "In addition to our strong financial results, in 2004 we made both company and technology acquisitions to expand into adjacent markets and double the number of offerings in our product portfolio. We also continued to increase the company's visibility worldwide and articulate the strategic value of access infrastructure. "We just kicked off the year with our annual Global Summit Week, where we trained over 2,600 members of our channel community and worldwide sales force. We look forward to solid execution in 2005, and we're off to a great start."

Customer Highlights Citrix closed several large customer sales during the quarter, including ADESA, Arla Foods, ICTRO and SHCP Servicio de Administracion Tributaria. ADESA, North America's largest publicly traded provider of wholesale vehicle auctions and used-vehicle-dealer floorplan-financing, licensed 2,900 seats of Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Presentation Server 3.0. The growing company uses MetaFrame Presentation Server to deploy all applications from its headquarters in Indianapolis to each of its 50-plus remote auction locations, eliminating costs associated with visiting each locale for application upgrades and database maintenance. The largest dairy company in Europe, Arla Foods, has licensed 6,700 seats of the Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R) Access Suite to provide its employees with secure, instant access to business information and centrally manage key enterprise applications. Arla Foods, a vast co-operative owned by 11,600 Swedish and Danish milk producers, intends to standardize on Citrix access infrastructure to maintain its strong presence in markets spanning more than 27 countries. In addition, by enabling the company's workforce to access supply chain applications from any connection in real-time, Arla Foods will further develop its position as an innovative global supplier of added value, milk-based ingredients for consumers throughout the world. ICTRO, the information systems organization in charge of maintaining the information technology infrastructure and applications for the courts and prosecution services in the Netherlands, selected Citrix access infrastructure to streamline its datacenter, enabling its large staff of judges, lawyers and support personnel to have on-demand, real-time access to key agency applications. With 5,000 additional licenses of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, over 15,000 ICTRO employees now have a secure, centralized platform to protect confidential government data from unauthorized access while being able to deploy new applications quickly and easily. SHCP Servicio de Administracion Tributaria, the federal tax collection agency in Mexico, recently acquired 1,000 seats of the Citrix MetaFrame Access Suite as a part of its access strategy. With the full suite the government agency is also fulfilling a new business continuity initiative. Product and Alliance Highlights During the fourth quarter, Citrix: -- Signed a five-year agreement with Microsoft Corporation that enables Citrix to deliver more comprehensive access solutions on the Microsoft(R) Windows(R) platform and will improve the access capabilities available in the forthcoming version of Windows Server(TM) codenamed "Longhorn." -- Acquired privately held Net6 Inc., a leader in providing secure access gateways. The acquisition extends Citrix's ability to provide secure and easy access to any resource, both data and voice, on-demand. The acquisition will enable Citrix to offer an unrivaled end-to-end access infrastructure system for voice, data and applications on a single, always-on gateway that can be accessed securely from a wide range of devices. -- Strengthened its strategic alliance with SAP AG by extending its SAP(R) Global Technology partnership to include membership in the SAP NetWeaver(TM) Partner Initiative. Further, in the first quarter of 2005, Citrix and SAP announced that the companies will offer a joint offering for small and mid-size businesses (SMB) that bundles SAP Business One with Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server. The companies also have unveiled a go-to-market strategy for the joint offering. -- Launched the Citrix Online suite of products in Australia and New Zealand, targeting individuals, SMB and large organizations through channel partners in the South Pacific. -- Formed an alliance with ViewSonic(R) Corp., a worldwide leader in visual display products, to offer a wireless computing solution with a 60-day free trial of Citrix(R) GoToMyPC(R) with every ViewSonic airsync(TM) V210 wireless display. -- Launched Citrix(R) GoToMeeting(TM) Corporate 1.1 with the capability of hosting scheduled online meetings for up to 200 attendees.
