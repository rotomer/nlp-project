Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. (a) As a result of a normal periodic review of the financial reports of Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company reviewed the presentation of cash and investments on its balance sheet. The Company concluded that collateral pledged under the Company's synthetic lease, credit default contracts and interest rate swaps should be presented as restricted cash equivalents and investments. After discussions among the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, management and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company determined on March 4, 2005 that it will restate its consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and for the first three quarters of 2004 to correct the presentation of cash and investments on the Company's balance sheet and to reflect certain reclassifications. Today the Company will file its restated consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements in an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and in amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Systems Announces Restatement of Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements Consistent With Previously Disclosed Presentation of Certain Restricted Cash and Investments FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 7, 2005-- No Effect on Historical or Future Revenues, Net Income, Earnings Per Share or Cash Flow from Operations Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today announced that it will restate the presentation of cash and investments on its balance sheet. As previously disclosed in the unaudited balance sheet that accompanied the Company's fourth quarter and year-end earnings press release issued by the Company on January 27, 2005, Citrix will present collateral pledged under the Company's synthetic lease, credit default contracts and interest rate swaps as restricted cash equivalents and investments. The nature and extent of all pledged collateral arrangements and restrictions have been fully and consistently disclosed from the inception of each arrangement in narrative form in the Company's reports filed with the SEC. The Company previously believed that its audited balance sheets and cash flow statements, which reflected pledged collateral in cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of a normal periodic review of the Company's financial reports by the staff of the SEC, the Company has reevaluated its presentation of cash and investments and will present pledged collateral on its balance sheet as restricted. The Company's balance sheet adjustments will not in any way affect the Company's historical or future revenues, net income, earnings per share, cash flow from operations, total assets or total cash and investments. Moreover, these adjustments do not change the Company's liquidity position or its ability to access its funds. The Company is restating its consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and for the first three quarters of 2004 to revise its presentation of cash and investments. The Company filed its restated financial statements with the SEC today. Citrix additionally reclassified, or adjusted its financial statement presentation for, the following items in its restated financial statements: -- expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangibles from amortization expense to a component of cost of revenues in the Company's consolidated income statement; -- proceeds from sales and maturities of the Company's investments, as well as cash flows from the Company's available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments, now presented separately in the Company's cash flow statement; and -- investments in auction rate securities from cash equivalents to short term investments pursuant to a recently published accounting interpretation. The Company does not currently anticipate any additional revisions to the Company's previously reported fiscal 2004 results of operations and financial position in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which the Company anticipates filing with the SEC on or before March 16, 2005. A reconciliation of amounts previously reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements to adjusted balances is included in this press release. About Citrix Citrix Systems, Inc.
