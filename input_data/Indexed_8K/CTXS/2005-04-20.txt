GAAP Results Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $39 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $9.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Net income in the first quarter of 2005 was adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets and amortization of deferred stock-based compensation and in the first quarter of 2004 was adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, write-off of deferred debt issuance costs and in-process research and development.

"Compared to the first quarter of 2004, we saw double-digit growth in all regions, including the Americas; impressive momentum from Citrix Online, including strong growth from Citrix GoToMeeting; and growth in new product revenue, especially with the Access Suite. "Our results show excellent execution as well as leverage from our expanded product portfolio. "On April 26, at our third annual Strategy Day, we will outline additional details of how the company plans to leverage its investments in the access infrastructure market."

We consider these measures important indicators of our success. In addition, Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
