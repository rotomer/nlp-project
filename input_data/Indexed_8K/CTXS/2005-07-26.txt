Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Second Quarter Earnings Results FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2005--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS): -- Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 18%; -- Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.16, Including Tax Impact of American Jobs Creation Act; -- Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.27, an Increase of 35% Over Comparable Period Last Year Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended June 30, 2005. FINANCIAL RESULTS GAAP Results In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Citrix achieved revenue of $211.2 million, compared to $178.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, representing 18 percent revenue growth. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $27.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share - which included a net tax provision of approximately $16 million recorded in anticipation of repatriating certain foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) - compared to net income of $31.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Non-GAAP Results Net income, adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation, and the above mentioned net tax provision, was $47.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $35.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. "Our second quarter results were excellent," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We're showing continued momentum in our business with strong top line and adjusted earnings growth, and another quarter of very solid cash flow. Our business continued its product license and license update growth while we built revenue streams from new products - with strong performances from Citrix GoToMeeting and Citrix Access Gateway. The traction in our new products makes us confident in our strategic moves into adjacent access infrastructure markets. "Our second quarter release of Access Suite 4.0 is getting partners and customers excited, giving them compelling reasons for adopting, expanding, or standardizing on Citrix. "We kicked off the third quarter by launching Access Essentials, our new product designed to bring secure, remote access to small businesses, and by winning our second 'Global ISV of the Year Award' from Microsoft. "We head into the second half of the year executing well on our strategy, and we look forward to the closing of the NetScaler transaction to further enhance our market leadership and the competitiveness of the Citrix Access Platform." Q2 Financial Summary In reviewing the second quarter results of 2005: -- The Americas region grew revenue 10 percent; the EMEA region grew 14 percent, and the Pacific region grew 12 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2004. -- Product license revenue increased 5 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2004. -- Revenue from license updates grew 20 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2004. -- Services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, excluding Citrix Online, grew 14 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2004. -- Citrix Online contributed $23.8 million of revenue, up 128 percent year over year on a GAAP basis and 77 percent when considering purchase accounting adjustments. -- Deferred revenue totaled $243 million, compared to $194 million in the second quarter of 2004. -- Cash flow from operations was approximately $65 million, compared to $45 million in the second quarter of 2004. This brings total trailing twelve months cash flow to over $280 million. Financial Outlook Citrix management offers the following guidance for the third quarter of 2005. This guidance includes the anticipated contribution of the NetScaler acquisition, which is expected to close in the middle of the third quarter of 2005. -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $215 million to $222 million. -- Total adjusted operating expenses are expected to increase 5 percent to 7 percent sequentially. -- GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.18, and diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation, and the write down of in-process research and development is expected to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.25. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2005 Citrix management offers the following guidance, which includes the impact of the NetScaler acquisition, for the fiscal year 2005. The company expects net revenue to be in the range of $865 million to $880 million. The company expects GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.81, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.05. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation and the write down of in-process research and development, and the tax estimated tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA. The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Company, Product and Alliance Highlights During the second quarter 2005, Citrix: -- Launched the Citrix Access Suite(TM) 4.0 offering more than 50 new features and a new universal SSL VPN appliance for unprecedented business performance, flexibility, and compliance. During the quarter the company also shipped new versions of the flagship Citrix Presentation Server(TM) 4.0, Citrix Password Manager(TM) 4.0 and the Citrix Access Gateway(TM) 4.0, a universal SSL VPN solution for both data and voice applications from the recently acquired Gateways division. -- Announced the acquisition of NetScaler, which will further expand the Citrix access platform and provide a range of application networking solutions that speed up applications by five times or more, and opens a new market for Citrix in providing products that optimize Web applications. -- Unveiled a new co-branded service with British Telecom to provide BT's Business Broadband customers with fast, easy and secure remote access to their home or office desktop PCs. The service, BT Remote Access Pack, is powered by Citrix(R) GoToMyPC(R) and targets the millions of UK residents who spend part of their time teleworking from home. -- Received four top awards for product excellence for its Citrix GoToMyPC remote desktop access service. The awards, including PC World 2005 World Class Award, PC Magazine Editors' Choice, the SIIA Codie Award for Best Mobile Product or Service, and MobilePC magazine's Mobile Choice Award, bring total awards for excellence to 11 over a 12-month period. Customer Highlights Citrix closed several large customer sales during the quarter, including Amadeus, BigBand Networks, Central DuPage Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, and Postini. Amadeus is a leading global distribution system (GDS) and technology provider serving the marketing, sales and distribution needs of the travel and tourism industries in over 210 worldwide markets. Amadeus turned to Citrix Online for help defining its support organization's access strategy, designed to improve customer service without adding costs or additional support resources. Citrix(R) GoToAssist(TM) allows Amadeus to meet its customer service objectives by enabling more than 100 National Marketing Companies (NMCs) to provide on-demand support to travel agencies and airline offices around the globe. BigBand Networks, a leading provider of platforms for broadband multimedia services, has licensed 100 Citrix(R) GoToMeeting(TM) seats, adding real-time collaboration capabilities to manage its growing, global base of customers and its globally distributed organization. With deployments on four continents providing live services to more than 20 million digital television and broadband Internet subscribers, BigBand Networks relies on GoToMeeting to facilitate a strong presence in their multi-national markets while continuing to build a seamless and integrated organization. For more than 40 years Central DuPage Hospital has been the leader in providing outstanding healthcare services to people who live and work in Chicago's western suburbs. Recognizing the advantages of deploying an Access Platform, the hospital chose the Citrix Access Suite for IT centralization, employee cost control and PC maintenance. Hamilton Health Sciences, one of Canada's largest multi-site teaching hospitals, selected the Citrix Access Platform for centralized application access and Citrix SmoothRoaming(TM) capabilities for its staff. With 3,500 seats of Citrix Presentation Server 3.0, the hospital has lowered its desktop costs and simplified application management for business-critical software such as Microsoft, Meditech and Peoplesoft. Once the roll-out is complete, 80 percent of all employees will use Citrix day-to-day for secure application access anytime, anywhere. Postini, the leading provider of e-mail security and management solutions, selected the Citrix Access Gateway to improve its VPN solution for secure remote access. Each week the company processes more than three billion e-mail messages for more than 5,000 companies around the globe - all while relying on a staff that works around the clock. The Access Gateway's self-installing client reduced support costs and provides an extra layer of security against threats by hiding the IP addresses of the remote network. The benefits of the Citrix Access Gateway have translated into better customer support and increased customer satisfaction.

These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity.
