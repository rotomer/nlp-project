Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Third Quarter Earnings Results; Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 21%; Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.23; Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.29 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2005--Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2005 ended September 30, 2005. Financial Results In the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Citrix achieved revenue of $226.9 million, compared to $187.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, representing 21 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $41.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share - which includes a $7.0 million expense charge for in-process research and development associated with the NetScaler acquisition - compared to net income of $38.4 million or $0.22 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Non-GAAP Results Net income, adjusted to exclude the effects of amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation and in-process research and development, was $52.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $42.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. "Our third quarter results were excellent," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "Good momentum drove solid growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. "We saw strong performance and accelerating momentum from our new products, especially with our online services, gateways and application networking product lines. The results indicate that customers are finding our much broader portfolio of products and services to be the most compelling set of access infrastructure solutions on the market. "We just kicked off the fourth quarter with Citrix iForum, explaining our vision for access to a record number of customers and previewing new technologies and capabilities. The excitement and interest was high, and we look forward to capitalizing on the momentum generated at iForum in the coming quarters." Q3 Financial Summary In reviewing the third quarter results of 2005: -- The Americas region grew revenue 18 percent; the EMEA region grew 14 percent, and the Pacific region grew 11 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. -- Product license revenue increased 10 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. -- Online services contributed $26.2 million of revenue, up 86 percent year over year on a GAAP basis and 63 percent when considering purchase accounting adjustments compared to the third quarter of 2004. -- Revenue from license updates grew 20 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 30 percent compared to the third quarter of 2004. -- Deferred revenue totaled $255 million compared to $202 million in the third quarter of 2004. -- Operating margin was 20 percent for the quarter; adjusted operating margin was 27 percent for the quarter excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred stock-based compensation, and the write off of in-process research and development related to business combinations. -- Cash flow from operations was over $76 million, compared to $62 million in the third quarter of 2004.
