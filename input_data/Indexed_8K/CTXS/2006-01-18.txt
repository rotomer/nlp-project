We consider these measures important indicators of our success. Citrix provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors to enable them to, among other things, better compare Citrix's most recent results of operations against financial models prepared by the company's investors and securities analysts, and to provide additional information concerning the impact of business acquisitions on Citrix's results of operations. In addition, we believe that it is useful to investors to review information concerning Citrix's results of operations on both a GAAP basis and a non-GAAP basis that excludes stock-based compensation expense under FAS 123(R) amongst others as it relates to 2006 forward-looking guidance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") such as net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods (in thousands, except for per share information and percentages): CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.
