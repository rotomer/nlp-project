Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports First Quarter Earnings Results; Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 29%; GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.24 Versus $0.22 Over Comparable Period Last Year FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2006-- Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.33 Versus $0.24 Over Comparable Period Last Year Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ended March 31, 2006. Financial Results In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $260 million, compared to $202 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 29 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $45 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $39 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the first quarter of 2006 increased 45 percent to $61 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $42 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and the effects of stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation impacted operating income by approximately $12 million. "Our first quarter results were excellent," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We had strong top line and earnings growth, and another quarter of very solid cash flow. Our business continued its product license and license update growth, especially in Presentation Server licenses as our customers continued to upgrade to version 4. "The results indicate that customers are finding our broad portfolio of products and services to be the most compelling set of access infrastructure solutions on the market." Q1 Financial Highlights In reviewing the first quarter results of 2006, compared to the first quarter of 2005: -- Revenue grew in the America's region by 27 percent; the EMEA region by 26 percent, and the Pacific region by 18 percent; -- Product license revenue increased 27 percent; -- Online services contributed $32 million of revenue, up 55 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 22 percent; and, -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 42 percent.

This brings total twelve month trailing cash flow from operations to $316 million.
