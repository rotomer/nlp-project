Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Second Quarter Earnings Results; Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 30%; GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.24 Versus $0.16 Over Comparable Period Last Year FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2006-- Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.33 Versus $0.27 Over Comparable Period Last Year Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in access infrastructure solutions, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 ended June 30, 2006. Financial Results In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $275 million, compared to $211 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 30 percent revenue growth. GAAP Results Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $46 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $28 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the second quarter of 2006 increased 34 percent to $64 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $48 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, adjusted results for the second quarter of 2005 exclude a net tax provision recorded in anticipation of repatriating certain foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). "I'm pleased with our second quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "We saw across-the-board strength in our product portfolio and in our geographic segments. We are well positioned for the second half of 2006 as we continue to drive our access infrastructure strategy." Q2 Financial Highlights In reviewing the second quarter results of 2006, compared to the second quarter of 2005: -- Revenue grew in the America's region by 36 percent, the EMEA region by 20 percent and the Pacific region by 24 percent; -- Product license revenue increased 28 percent; -- Online services contributed $35 million of revenue, up 47 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 24 percent; and -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 52 percent. Other financial highlights included: -- Deferred revenue totaled $311 million, compared to $243 million on June 30, 2005; -- Operating margin was 19 percent for the quarter; non-GAAP operating margin was 27 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the tax effects related to those items; and -- Cash flow from operations was $60 million, compared to $65 million in the second quarter of 2005. This brings total twelve month trailing cash flow from operations to approximately $310 million. Financial Outlook for Third Fiscal Quarter 2006 Citrix management offers the following guidance for the third fiscal quarter 2006 ending September 30, 2006: -- Net revenue is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $280 million, compared to $227 million in the third quarter of 2005. -- GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.26, compared to $0.23 in the third quarter of 2005.
