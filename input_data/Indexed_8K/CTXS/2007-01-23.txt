Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Results Year-over-year Quarterly Revenue Growth of 19% Annual Revenue Growth of 25% FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Preliminary Financial Results In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Citrix achieved revenue of $321 million, compared to $269 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, representing 19 percent revenue growth. Annual revenues for 2006 were $1.134 billion, compared to $909 million in the previous year, a 25 percent increase. GAAP Results Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $59 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Annual net income for 2006 was $196 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $166 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP Results Non-GAAP net income, in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by nine percent to $73 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $67 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, and the tax effects related to those items. Annual non-GAAP net income for 2006 was $262 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to $209 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in 2005. Non-GAAP net income excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in-process research and development (IPR&D) and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, in 2005 non-GAAP net income also excludes the tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). "A strong finish to another very strong year of growth," said Mark Templeton, Citrix president and chief executive officer. "We've built excellent momentum in each of our businesses, and I believe we're entering 2007 with the best product pipeline, channel partnerships, and brand strength we've ever had. We're well-positioned for continued growth as we lead the formation of the application delivery market." Stock Option Review During the quarter, the Audit Committee of the company's Board of Directors began a voluntary review of the company's historical stock option granting practices and the related accounting. This voluntary review was initiated in light of news about the option practices of numerous companies across several industries and not in response to any governmental investigation, whistleblower complaint or inquiries from media organizations. The Audit Committee has engaged independent outside legal counsel to conduct the review. Because this review is ongoing, the company has not yet determined if it will need to record any non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants, making today's results preliminary. Specifically, the company does not know whether any such non-cash compensation charges would affect the preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 or the full year 2006 being announced today, or would be deemed material and require the company to restate previously issued financial statements or would require an adjustment to the retained earnings balance on the company's balance sheet. If any such charges are required, Citrix will also need to determine the impact of this matter on its system of internal controls. Q4 Financial Highlights In reviewing the fourth quarter preliminary results of 2006, compared to the fourth quarter of 2005: -- Revenue grew in the America's region by 20 percent; the EMEA region by eight percent, and the Pacific region by 33 percent; -- Product license revenue increased 10 percent; -- Online services contributed $43 million of revenue, up 50 percent; -- Revenue from license updates grew 23 percent; and, -- Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 23 percent; -- Deferred revenue totaled $356 million, compared to $286 million at December 31, 2005; -- Operating margin was 20 percent for the quarter; non-GAAP operating margin was 27 percent for the quarter excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expenses; -- Cash flow from operations was over $97 million, compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2005; -- In its stock repurchase activity, the company received 3.6 million shares of its common stock at an average net price per share of $29.63 for a total value of approximately $107 million.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, the write-off of in-process research and development and for 2005, a non-recurring tax provision related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the AJCA. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors: -- The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. -- Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. -- Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. -- The company considers the 2005 tax provision related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the AJCA as non-recurring as it is not reasonably likely to recur within two years and there was no similar provision in the prior two years. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of this tax provision provides investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.
