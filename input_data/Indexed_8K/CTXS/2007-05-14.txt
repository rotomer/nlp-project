Section 3--Securities and Trading Markets Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, as expected, it received on May 14, 2007, an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination notice stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with Nasdaq for continued listing. As anticipated, the letter was issued in accordance with Nasdaq's procedures as a result of the delayed filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. As previously disclosed, Nasdaq initially informed the Company on March 15, 2007 that its securities would be delisted due to the Company's delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 unless the Company requested a hearing in accordance with applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Company subsequently requested and was granted a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and presented a plan for compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements. The Company is awaiting the Panel's decision and intends to supplement its pending request to address the delayed filing of the first quarter Form 10-Q. Pending a decision by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, the Company's shares will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing. As previously disclosed, the Company is in the process of completing its voluntary, independent review of its historical stock option granting practices and related accounting. The Company intends to file its annual and quarterly reports as soon as practicable after completion of that review. Section 7--Regulation FD Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
