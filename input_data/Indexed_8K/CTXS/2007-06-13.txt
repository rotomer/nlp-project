Exhibit 99.1 Citrix Announces Findings of Voluntary Stock Option Review Citrix Granted Extension by NASDAQ FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 13, 2007--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors reported its findings from the voluntary review into Citrix's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting that has been ongoing for approximately the last seven months. This comprehensive review was conducted by the Audit Committee, which was assisted by both independent outside legal counsel and forensic accounting consultants. The review covered option grants made to employees, executives and directors during the period from January 1996 to December 2006, consisting of approximately 200 grant dates representing over 27,000 individual option grants. The review included an extensive examination of the Company's stock option granting practices, accounting policies, related accounting records, supporting documentation and electronic data, including e-mail, as well as over 50 interviews with current and former officers, employees, members of the Board of Directors and outside professionals. The Audit Committee concluded that from 1996 until mid-1998, the Company followed processes and procedures that likely led to the setting of grant dates retrospectively for many stock options granted to employees and executives. The Audit Committee found that none of the Company's current executives were responsible for retrospective selection of grant dates during this period. For grants from 1996 through late-2003, the accounting issues corrected in the restatement were caused mainly by errors such as delays in obtaining written approvals of grants, incomplete adherence to grant procedures, and process deficiencies in the grant procedures. Many of the errors during this period resulted from delays in obtaining written approval of grants for which the grant dates were selected in advance. After late 2003, there were only a few issues, caused by administrative errors. After completion of its investigation, the Audit Committee concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current executive of the company in connection with the Company's stock option grants and procedures during the period under review (1996-2006). As a result of the voluntary review, and as previously announced by the Company, the Company intends to restate its previously issued financial statements and reports thereon for the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and for the interim quarterly periods for 2005 and 2006 to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised. The Company intends to submit a request for consultation on certain interpretive issues to the Office of Chief Accountant ("OCA") of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of the pending OCA consultation, the Company has not yet determined conclusively the amount of additional non-cash compensation expense to be recorded or the resulting tax impact. As a result of the information collected by the Audit Committee during its review, management has proposed recommendations for further enhancement of the Company's equity-based compensation granting practices. Today the Company also announced that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, subject to certain conditions, has granted the Company an extension of time until July 30, 2007 in which to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, all required restated and other financial statements for previous periods, and to otherwise meet all necessary listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. During the extension period, the Company's common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. About Citrix Citrix Systems, Inc.
