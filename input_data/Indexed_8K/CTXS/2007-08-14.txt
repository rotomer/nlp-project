Section 3--Securities and Trading Markets Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") announced that, as expected, it received on August 9, 2007, an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination notice stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with Nasdaq for continued listing. As anticipated, the letter was issued in accordance with Nasdaq's procedures as a result of the delayed filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. As previously disclosed, Nasdaq initially informed the Company on March 15, 2007 that its securities would be delisted due to the Company's delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 unless the Company requested a hearing in accordance with applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Company subsequently requested and was granted a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. Prior to the Panel rendering its decision, on May 11, 2007, as previously disclosed, the Company received an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination Notice as a result of the Company's delay in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Currently, the Panel has rendered decisions granting the Company's request for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to, among other things, the Company being current in its public filings prior to August 30, 2007. The Company intends to make a submission to the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council to address the delayed filing of its second quarter Form 10-Q. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council will grant the Company's request for continued listing. On June 13, 2007, the Company announced the findings of the voluntary investigation of its historical stock option granting practices and related accounting conducted by the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. As a result of the voluntary investigation, and as previously announced by the Company, the Company intends to restate its previously issued financial statements and reports thereon for the fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and for the interim quarterly periods for 2005 and 2006 to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised. Further, as previously announced, the Company intends to shortly submit a request for consultation on certain interpretive issues to the Office of Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "OCA"). Because of the pending OCA consultation, the Company has not yet become current in its public filings or determined conclusively the amount of additional non-cash compensation expense to be recorded as a result of the investigation of the Company's historical stock option granting practices or the resulting tax impact. The Company intends to file its annual and quarterly reports as soon as practicable after completion of the OCA consultation process. Section 7--Regulation FD Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
