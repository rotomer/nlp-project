These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses and the write-off of in-process research and development. The company's basis for these adjustments is described below. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the company's executives. The company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the company's operating performance due to the following factors: -- The company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the company's operating results and underlying operational trends. -- Amortization costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. -- Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact because such charges are generally fixed at the time of grant, are then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.
