Explanatory Note
As previously reported, on October 19, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc. ("Citrix") acquired Xensource Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("Xensource"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2007, by and among Citrix, PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, Xensource and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative. This Form 8-K/A is filed as an amendment (Amendment No. 1) to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Citrix on October 22, 2007 to report the completion of its acquisition of Xensource under Items 2.01 and 9.01 (the "Original Form 8-K"). This Amendment No. 1 is being filed to delete Items 9.01(a) and (b) of the Original Form 8-K, which previously referenced Citrix's intention to file financial statements of Xensource and pro forma financial information. Citrix has determined that the acquisition of Xensource did not involve the acquisition of a business that is significant, as such terms are defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and no such filing of financial statements or pro forma financial information is required.
 
On October 19, 2007, Citrix Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), completed its previously announced acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Palo Alto, California ("XenSource"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 14, 2007 and as amended on September 20, 2007, by and among Citrix, PVA Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, PVA Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Citrix, XenSource, and John G. Connors, as stockholder representative (the "Merger Agreement"). The purchase price was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock, which has been recorded by Citrix as approximately $328.5 million in purchase price consideration payable in cash and common stock plus the issuance of approximately 1.3 million unvested shares of common stock and the assumption of approximately 3.3 million stock options each of which will be exercisable for the right to receive one share of Citrix common stock upon vesting. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the stock consideration is based on a per share value for Citrix's common stock of $36.18. $62.5 million of the purchase price was placed in escrow as security for the indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement. The purchase price was determined in arms length negotiations between Citrix and XenSource.
The Sevin Rosen funds, a venture capital firm, was a stockholder in XenSource. Steve Dow, a director of Citrix, is a general partner of the Sevin Rosen funds and did not directly hold any interest in XenSource. Although the Sevin Rosen funds were represented on the Board of Directors of XenSource, Mr. Dow was not a director of XenSource. The Merger provided a return to all general partners of the firm, including Mr. Dow. Subject to certain assumptions, Citrix currently estimates that the potential allocation to Mr. Dow through the general partner entities of the Sevin Rosen funds related to the Merger is approximately $1.9 million. Mr. Dow has been on the Citrix Board of Directors since 1989 and currently owns 262,349 shares of Citrix common stock. Mr. Dow did not attend the meeting at which the Citrix Board approved the transaction and recused himself from the vote to approve the transaction. Consistent with Citrix's policies and the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Citrix's Board of Directors, the
Merger was reviewed and approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. There are no material relationships among Citrix and XenSource or any of their respective affiliates or any of the parties to the Merger Agreement and related agreements, other than in respect of such agreements themselves and as disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
LAS VEGAS(BUSINESS WIRE)Oct. 22, 2007Today at Citrix iForum(TM), the world's largest application delivery conference and expo, Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) announced it has completed the acquisition of XenSource, Inc., a privately held leader in enterprise-grade virtual infrastructure solutions. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $500 million payable in a combination of cash and Citrix common stock.
This acquisition moves Citrix, a pioneer in the application virtualization market, into adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets  expected by Citrix to grow to nearly $5 billion over the next four years. By acquiring XenSource, Citrix is now the only company to offer organizations an end-to-end application delivery infrastructure that leverages the method of application, desktop and server virtualization best suited for the dynamic delivery of applications to any user (see today's separate press release on the company's enhanced virtualization strategy).
As previously announced on Aug. 15 upon close of the acquisition the XenSource team and products will form the core of the new Virtualization & Management Division of Citrix dedicated to building and growing these important new businesses. Peter Levine, XenSource, CEO, will lead the new division, reporting directly to Mark Templeton, Citrix president and CEO. Under Peter's leadership, this new division will oversee Citrix's businesses in server virtualization and application delivery management solutions as part of the company's overall application delivery infrastructure strategy.
Citrix also reiterated its commitment to maintaining and growing support for the independent Xen open source community which develops the underlying virtualization engine used by many commercial products throughout the industry, including those from XenSource. The Xen project, which includes significant contributions from companies like Intel, AMD, HP, IBM and Dell, is led by XenSource co-founder, and new Citrix employee, Ian Pratt. Since news of the acquisition, XenSource has worked with the key contributors to the Xen project to develop procedures for independent oversight of the project, ensuring that it continues to operate with full transparency, fairness and vendor neutrality. Citrix agrees these principles are critical to the continued role of Xen as a freely available open source industry standard for virtualization.
"The XenSource products, team and culture are a great addition to the Citrix family," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. "The combination of Citrix and XenSource brings together application, desktop and server virtualization to deliver more innovation, choice and flexibility to the market, including our installed base of more than 200,000 customers worldwide. As application delivery becomes a top issue for IT and the world becomes more dynamic, we find it important to be sure we are providing customers the most cutting-edge technologies out there."
