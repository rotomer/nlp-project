The following information is intended to be furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by a specific reference in such filing.
On July 23, 2008, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release reporting its financial results for the second quarter of 2008 ended June 30, 2008 (the "Press Release"). The Press Release also included the Company's financial outlook for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008. The Press Release was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 23, 2008.
Subsequent to the issuance of the Press Release, it was discovered that the expected GAAP diluted earnings per share included in the Press Release did not reflect the effect of the differential between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates related to the amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense that had been used by the Company to determine the expected non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the respective periods. Including these tax effects, the range of expected GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 should have been $0.18 to $0.23; and the range of expected GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 should have been $0.83 to $0.91. The foregoing does not impact the expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the same periods included in the Press Release, nor does it reflect any change in or update to the assumptions used by the Company to determine the non-GAAP expected future earnings per share included in the Press Release, which speaks only as of the date of the Press Release.
The following table shows the expected non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter ending September 30, 2008 and fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 included in the Press Release, reconciled to the expected GAAP earnings per share numbers described above.
 
The above information is based on the Company's expectations as of the date of the Press Release, and speaks only as of the date of the Press Release. The Company is not otherwise updating its previous expected future earnings per share statements, nor is it affirming such statements as of the date of this report. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this report, the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to SEC requirements, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the table above. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expenses. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management excludes the expenses described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
 
 
 
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of the company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
