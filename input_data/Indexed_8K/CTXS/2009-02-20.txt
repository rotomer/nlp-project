(3) A stockholder providing timely notice under this Section 1.10 of nominations or business proposed to be brought before a stockholder meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information (including, without limitation, the Material Ownership Interests information) provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 1.10 shall be true and correct as of the record date for such stockholder meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days prior to such stockholder meeting, and such update and supplement shall be in writing and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the fifth (5th) business day after the record date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than the close of business on the eighth (8th) business day prior to the date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting).
(4) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased
 
Board of Directors at least seventy (70) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is held more than thirty (30) days before or sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, at least seventy (70) days prior to such annual meeting), a stockholder's notice required by this Section 1.10 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting, who is present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting, and who complies with the notice procedures (including the procedures to update and supplement such notice) set forth in this Section 1.10. If the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if such stockholder has complied with the following procedures: (i) stockholder's written notice has been received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting nor later than the later of (x) the close of business of the sixtieth (60th) day prior to such special meeting or (y) the close of business of the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting; (ii) such stockholder's written notice includes the information required to be provided in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 1.10, and (iii) such stockholder has provided updates or supplements (if any) to such notice at the times and in the forms required by paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 1.10. For the avoidance of doubt, for a stockholder to bring nominations before a special meeting of stockholders, such stockholder must comply with the notice and other procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and this shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to bring such nominations properly before a special meeting.

General
(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10. Except as otherwise
 
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.10 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance herewith, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
(2) In no event shall the adjournment, postponement or rescheduling of any previously scheduled meeting of stockholders commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice under this Section 1.10. For purposes of this Section 1.10, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the stockholder meeting to present a nomination or any proposed business, such nomination or business shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (C)(3) of Section 1.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a written instrument executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such written instrument or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the written instrument or electronic transmission, at the meeting of the stockholders.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein. Nothing in this Section 1.10 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to have proposals included in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor rule) under the Exchange Act and, to the extent required by such Rule, have such proposals considered and voted on at an annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors under specified circumstances.
