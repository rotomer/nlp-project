Citrix Reports Third Quarter Financial Results
Quarterly Revenue of $401 million
GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.29
Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.43
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 21, 2009--Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended September 30, 2009.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Citrix achieved revenue of $401 million, compared to $399 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
GAAP Results
Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was $53 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $49 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008.
Non-GAAP Results
Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $80 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for both periods excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations and stock-based compensation expense and the tax effects related to those items. In addition, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2009 excludes charges recorded in connection with the restructuring program that the company implemented in January 2009, and the tax effects related to those items.
I'm pleased with our solid third quarter results," said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer for Citrix. Our sales, product and operational teams executed very well in a tough economic climate to not only post good results, but to strengthen Citrix leadership in the web collaboration, desktop virtualization and datacenter transformation markets.
Q3 Financial Summary
In reviewing the third quarter results of 2009, compared to the third quarter of 2008:
Product license revenue decreased 18 percent;
Revenue from license updates grew 7 percent;
Online services revenue grew 21 percent;
Technical services revenue, which is comprised of consulting, education and technical support, grew 20 percent;
Revenue decreased in the EMEA region by 15 percent; decreased in the Pacific region by 5 percent; and increased in the Americas region by 5 percent;
Deferred revenue grew to $556 million, compared to $481 million on September 30, 2008;
GAAP operating margin was 14 percent for the quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 25 percent for the quarter, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense and costs associated with the restructuring program;
Cash flow from operations was $134 million; and
The company repurchased 2.1 million shares at an average price of $35.56.
Financial Outlook
Due to the volatility of market conditions in the foreseeable future, it is more likely that the companys actual results could differ materially from expectations. Similar to the financial outlook we have provided for the last two fiscal quarters, Citrix is continuing to provide less quantitative guidance than it has historically.
Financial Outlook for Fourth Quarter 2009
Citrix management expects to achieve the following results during its fourth fiscal quarter 2009 ending December 31, 2009:
Net revenue is expected to increase three to four percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase 50 to 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2008, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges as well as prior year exclusions of in-process research and development related to business combinations.
Interest income is expected to be $5 million.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2009
The companys financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2009 for both net revenue and non-GAAP operating margin remains unchanged.
The company expects net revenue to increase modestly as compared to 2008; and
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by as much as 100 basis points compared to non-GAAP operating margin from the prior year, excluding the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges, as well as prior year exclusions of in process research and development related to business combinations.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Preliminary Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2010
The companys preliminary financial outlook for the full fiscal year 2010 is for net revenue to increase between eight and nine percent over full fiscal year 2009, and to continue operational leverage to drive a 75 to 100 basis point expansion in non-GAAP operating margin over the full fiscal year 2009. Non-GAAP operating margin excludes the effects of amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.
The above statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Citrix's earnings release, conference call, slide presentation or webcast, Citrix may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure used or discussed and a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure are included in this press release after the condensed consolidated financial statement or can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Citrix corporate Web site at .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures
(Unaudited)
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release and related conference call, slide presentation or webcast to the most directly comparable financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to business combinations, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Companys restructuring program and the related tax effect of those items. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.
Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's gross margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.
Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization, in-process research and development and certain stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to business combinations, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends.
Amortization costs and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.
Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.
The charges incurred in conjunction with the Company's restructuring program, which relate to reductions in headcount and exit costs associated with consolidating certain facilities, are not anticipated to be ongoing costs and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity. Furthermore, the Company in the future may exclude amortization and in-process research and development primarily related to new business combinations, additional charges related to its restructuring program and the related tax effects from financial measures that it releases, and the Company expects to continue to incur stock-based compensation expenses.
