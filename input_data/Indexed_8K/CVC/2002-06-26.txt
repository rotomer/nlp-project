                         On June 10, 2002, Century Communications Corporation ("Century"), a subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corporation ("Adelphia"), filed a petition seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On June 25, 2002, Adelphia filed a petition seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
                         As of June 26, 2002, the Company estimates that Adelphia, and its subsidiaries, including Century, owe certain networks included in the Cablevision New York Group and certain networks included in the Rainbow Media Group ("RMG") the approximate amounts set forth below for programming licensing, subject to applicable audit rights in connection with the Company's programming licenses.

                         Under the licensing agreements certain networks included in the Cablevision New York Group and certain networks included in RMG would bill the approximate monthly amounts as follows: RMG's Core Networks and Core Consolidated Regional Sports bill Adelphia approximately $3.1 million per month for programming services; the Developing/Other and Non-Consolidated Regional Sports businesses bill Adelphia approximately $500,000 per month for programming services and Madison Square Garden bills Adelphia approximately $300,000 per month for programming services. The next monthly billing by such networks to Adelphia becomes payable to the networks on June 30, 2002, and is not reflected in the table above.
                         The Company affirms RMG's 2002 guidance excluding the full year 2002 impact of potential Adelphia bad debt. The Company intends to closely monitor the bankruptcy proceedings and vigorously pursue its payment rights.
