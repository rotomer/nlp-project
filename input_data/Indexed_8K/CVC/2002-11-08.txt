"Losses") to which they may become subject as a result of (i) any and all breaches of a representation or warranty of Cablevision in this Agreement (other than Sections 3.03(b), 3.03(c), 3.04(e)(iii) and 3.19(c)), (ii) any and all breaches of a representation or warranty of Cablevision in Sections 3.03(b), 3.03(c), 3.04(e)(iii) or 3.19(c) of this Agreement, (iii) the nonperformance or breach of any covenants or agreements of Cablevision in Section 5.01 of this Agreement, (iv) the nonperformance or breach of any covenants or agreements of Cablevision in this Agreement (other than Section 5.01), (v) the Actions described in paragraph (d) of Schedule 3.12 and any similar Actions commenced by present or former shareholders of Cablevision (other than Actions in which GE or any of its Affiliates is a party other than as a passive member of a class or putative class prior to the expiration of the opt-out period), (vi) any IFC Liabilities, or (vii) any of the matters disclosed on Schedule 3.14.

For the avoidance of doubt, if a matter was required to be listed on one of the foregoing schedules because it meets the materiality standard (and any other requirements) for disclosure on such schedule and such matter was not listed, then a breach of such representation will have occurred. On the other hand, if a matter was not required to be listed on one of the foregoing schedules because it did not meet the materiality standard for disclosure on such schedule, such representation will not be deemed to have been breached by virtue of such matter not being listed on the schedule for that reason. (c) Payment. Any obligations of Cablevision under the provisions of this Article 10 shall be paid in cash promptly to the Cablevision Indemnified Party by Cablevision (except that any payment after the Closing with respect to a Loss of NBC Holdings shall be paid to BHC and the Surviving Corporation in proportion to the BHC Percentage and the B2HC Percentage) and, if paid after the Closing, shall represent (i) a retroactive adjustment to the Exchanges if paid to a party other than BHC or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) a retroactive contribution to capital if paid to BHC or the Surviving Corporation. The amount of such payment (and adjustment) shall be equal, on an After-Tax Basis, to the amount of the Loss incurred by the Cablevision Indemnified Party on account of -64-
the matter for which indemnification is required hereunder less the amount of any payments actually received by such Cablevision Indemnified Party pursuant to any third-party insurance policy or similar arrangement after giving effect to any retroactive premium adjustments or similar costs payable to third parties. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right of a Cablevision Indemnified Party to be indemnified pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) and 10.02(a)(iii) shall be limited as follows: (i) a Cablevision Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnification to the extent that, and shall not be entitled to any indemnification until, the aggregate of all amounts subject to indemnification exceeds $25,000,000 (and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed that amount), (ii) as to any particular indemnity claim or series of indemnity claims arising out of the same or related facts, events or circumstances, a Cablevision Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnity for such claim or claims only if such indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims equals or exceeds $100,000, in which case the Cablevision Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnity for the full amount of such claim or claims, and (iii) the maximum amount that Cablevision will be required to pay in respect of all claims by all parties is $250,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the monetary limitations set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(ii), 10.02(a)(iv), 10.02(a)(v), 10.02(a)(vi) or 10.02(a)(vii). 10.03 Indemnification by NBC Holdings, NBC and GE Merger Sub. (a) Indemnity. Subject to Sections 10.01, 10.03(b) and 10.03(c), NBC Holdings, NBC and GE Merger Sub agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless or, after the Closing, to cause BHC and the Surviving Corporation in proportion to the BHC Percentage and the B2HC Percentage to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, Cablevision, its Affiliates and their respective shareholders, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (an "NBC Holdings Indemnified Party"), on an After-Tax Basis, from and against all Losses to which they may become subject as a result of (i) any and all breaches of a representation or warranty by NBC or NBC Holdings in this Agreement (other than Sections 4.03, 4.05 and 4.08), (ii) any and all breaches of a representation or warranty by NBC or NBC Holdings in Section 4.03, 4.05 or 4.08 in this Agreement, or (iii) the nonperformance or breach of any covenant or agreement of NBC Holdings or NBC contained herein. (b) For the purposes of seeking indemnity pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(i) and (ii), the representations and warranties of NBC and NBC Holdings will be interpreted without giving effect to any qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "NBC Material Adverse Effect" or "GE Material Adverse Effect". (c) Payment. Any obligations of NBC Holdings, NBC and GE Merger Sub under the provisions of this Article shall be paid in cash promptly to the NBC -65-
Holdings Indemnified Party by NBC Holdings, NBC and GE Merger Sub or, subject to Section 2.07(b), in the case of a post-Closing payment, by NBC Holdings, NBC and GE Merger Sub causing BHC and the Surviving Corporation to make such prompt payment in cash and shall represent a retroactive adjustment to the Exchanges. The amount of such payment (and adjustment) shall be equal, on an After-Tax Basis, to the amount of the Loss incurred by the NBC Holdings Indemnified Party on account of the matter for which indemnification is required hereunder less the amount of any payments actually received by such NBC Holdings Indemnified Party pursuant to any third-party insurance policy or similar arrangement after giving effect to any retroactive premium adjustments or similar costs payable to third parties. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the right of an NBC Holdings Indemnified Party to be indemnified pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(i) shall be limited as follows: (i) a NBC Holdings Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to indemnification to the extent that, and shall not be entitled to any indemnification until, the aggregate of all amounts subject to indemnification exceeds $25,000,000 (and then only for the amount by which such Losses exceed that amount), (ii) as to any particular indemnity claim or series of indemnity claims arising out of the same or related facts, events or circumstances, an NBC Holdings Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnity for such claim or claims only if such indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims equals or exceeds $100,000, in which case the NBC Holdings Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek indemnity for the full amount of such claim or claims, and (iii) the maximum amount that NBC and NBC Holdings will be required to pay in respect of all claims by all parties is $250,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the monetary limitations set forth in the preceding sentence shall not apply to a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(ii) or 10.03(a)(iii). 10.04 Third Party Claims, Etc. If any claim ("Asserted Claim") covered by the foregoing indemnities is asserted against any indemnified party ("Indemnitee") by a third party, it shall be a condition to the obligations under this Article that the Indemnitee shall promptly give the indemnifying party ("Indemnitor") notice thereof in accordance with Section 13.05; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not affect the rights to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto so long as written notice of a claim is given prior to the expiration of the applicable representations, warranties or covenants except to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitee shall give Indemnitor an opportunity to control negotiations toward resolution of such claim without the necessity of litigation, and, if litigation ensues, to defend the same with counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee, at Indemnitor's expense, and Indemnitee shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with such defense. If the Indemnitor fails to assume control of the negotiations prior to litigation or the defense of such action within a reasonable time, Indemnitee shall be entitled, but not obligated, to assume control of such negotiations or defense of such action, and Indemnitor shall be liable to the Indemnitee for its expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith which Indemnitor shall promptly pay. If the Indemnitor -66-
has reasonably concluded, based on the written advice of counsel, that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain one separate firm of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, in which case the reasonable fees, disbursements and charges of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor has assumed control of the negotiations or defense and has not notified the Indemnitee that it has concluded that there exists a conflict of interest contemplated by the prior sentence, an Indemnitee may deliver a written request to Indemnitor for confirmation that the Asserted Claim is covered by the Indemnitor's indemnification obligation under this Article 10. If the Indemnitor denies that the Asserted Claim is so covered or fails to respond to such request by the twentieth day following the later of the date of delivery of the written request or the date of commencement of the action in respect thereof, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain one separate firm of counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitor to be kept informed of, and consulted with respect to, developments relating to the legal proceedings relating to the Asserted Claim and the reasonable fees, disbursements and charges of such counsel to Indemnitee will initially be at the expense of Indemnitee but with the understanding that (i) if it is subsequently determined that the Asserted Claim was covered by Indemnitor's indemnification obligation under this Article 10 or (ii) Indemnitor effects a settlement with the Person pursuing the Asserted Claim, Indemnitor shall be obligated to repay Indemnitee for all such fees, disbursements and charges. If Indemnitor is responsible for repayment pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence, then the repayment shall include interest on the repaid amounts at 6% per annum from the date of incurrence to the date of payment. Neither Indemnitor nor Indemnitee shall settle, compromise, or make any other disposition of any Asserted Claims, which would or might result in any liability to Indemnitee or Indemnitor, respectively, under this Article 10 without the written consent of Indemnitee or Indemnitor, respectively, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If an Indemnitee asserts a claim for indemnification hereunder in respect of an Asserted Claim as to which an action has been brought against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall upon the written request of the Indemnitor, promptly implead, commence an action over or take such other comparable procedural step as may be available to the Indemnitee to make the Indemnitor party to such action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Asserted Claim (and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitor incurred by the Indemnitee in defending such Asserted Claim) if the Asserted Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee that would materially adversely affect the Business and that is the only claim made or that cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. The Indemnitor shall also be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim at its own expense. If such claim for an order, injunction or other equitable relief can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages. -67-
If the Closing occurs, the indemnification provided for in this Article 10 shall be the exclusive remedy of any party in respect of inaccuracy in any representations and warranties contained herein. 11. Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, each party will execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and transfer, fully cooperate with the other parties and take such other actions as the other parties reasonably may request to effect the purposes and intent of this Agreement. This Article 11 is not intended to extend the period for performance of Cablevisions's obligations pursuant to Section 9.06(b)(ii). 12. Closing. 12.01 Closing. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, 375 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10152 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth Business Day after all consents required as conditions to the sale as provided in Sections 7.01 and 8.01 have been received (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to March 31, 2003 (the "Outside Date"), then any party (other than a party whose material breach or default of its obligations under this Agreement has caused the Closing not to occur by such Outside Date) may terminate this Agreement upon and effective as of the date of written notice to the other parties. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver all instruments and documents as shall be necessary in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the respective parties to effect the Exchanges of securities and the delivery of securities in the B2HC Merger. 12.02 Termination. (a) In addition to the termination provided for in Section 12.01, this Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned: (i) At any time, by the mutual written agreement of NBC Holdings and Cablevision; (ii) by NBC or NBC Holdings, upon a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Cablevision set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7 of this Agreement cannot be satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date; (iii) by Cablevision, upon a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of NBC or NBC Holdings set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section 8 of this Agreement cannot be satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date; -68-
(iv) By Cablevision or NBC Holdings, upon and effective as of the date of written notice to the other, pursuant to the termination provisions of Section 9.02. (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this Section 12.02 or pursuant to Section 12.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto, except (i) that the provisions of Section 13 shall survive a termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing shall relieve either party from liability for any breach or default hereunder. 13. Miscellaneous. 13.01 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally and no waiver of compliance with any provision or condition hereof and no consent provided for herein shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing duly executed by the party hereto sought to be charged with such waiver or consent. No waiver of any term or provision hereof shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such term or provision or any other term or provision. Any condition to the performance of any party hereto which may legally be waived at or prior to the Closing may be waived in writing at any time by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. 13.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements, memoranda, arrangements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related Agreements and other than any writing signed by a party, dated on or prior to the date of this Agreement and which expressly refers to this Section 13.02. No representation, warranty, promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by any party which is not contained in this Agreement, such Confidentiality Agreement, such Related Agreements or any such writing, and no party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained herein or therein and each party expressly agrees that it has not relied upon any such representation, promise, inducement or statement of intent. 13.03 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

harmless the Stockholder, each other Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such Registrable Securities and each other Person who controls any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Stockholder or any such underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will reimburse the Stockholder and each such underwriter and controlling person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, liability, action or proceedings; provided that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, any such Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Stockholder for use in the preparation thereof, (ii) the use of any Prospectus after such time as the obligation of the Company to keep the same effective and current has expired, or (iii) the use of any Prospectus after such time as the Company has advised the Stockholder that the filing of a post-effective amendment or supplement thereto is required, except such Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, and provided further that the Company shall not be liable to any Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of Registrable Securities or any other Person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of the matters described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above or such Person's failure to send or give a copy of the final Prospectus or supplement to the Persons asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was corrected in such final Prospectus or supplement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Stockholder or any such underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the Stockholder. The Company's indemnity hereunder shall relate only to the Shares, and the Company
shall otherwise have no indemnity obligations with respect to the securities issued by the Stockholder or the registration thereof. (b) Indemnification By The Stockholder. The Stockholder will, and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in subdivision (a) of this Section 6) the Company, each director and officer of the Company, and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact from such Registration Statement, any Prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Stockholder for use in the preparation of such Registration Statement, Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto; provided, -------- however, that the Stockholder shall not be liable to the extent that the losses, liabilities ------- or expenses arise out of or are based upon (i) the use by the Company of any Prospectus after such time as the obligation of the Company to keep the same effective and current has expired or (ii) the use by the Company of any Prospectus after such time as the Stockholder has advised the Company that the filing of a post-effective amendment or supplement thereto is required with respect to any information contained in such Prospectus concerning the Stockholder, except such Prospectus as so amended or supplemented. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, or any such director, officer, or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the Stockholder.

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in the preceding subdivisions of this Section 6, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party, unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) Contribution. If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable, or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of the expense, loss, damage or liability, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other (determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission), or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law or provides a lesser sum to the indemnified party than the amount hereinafter calculated, in the proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, but also the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No indemnified party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) Additional Indemnification By The Stockholder. In the case of any registration of securities other than the Shares, it shall be a condition to the Company's obligation to proceed under this Agreement that the Stockholder shall provide, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company, indemnification, contribution and other rights in favor of the Company, each director and officer of the Company and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to the securities issued by the Stockholder and the registration thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as applicable to the Stockholder in the case of registrations of Registrable Securities hereunder.

extent as applicable to the Stockholder in the case of registrations of Registrable Securities under Section 6(b). 7. Covenants Relating To Rule 144/145.

EXHIBIT D REORGANIZATION TRANSACTIONS Part I: Preliminary Steps: 1. Rainbow MM Holdings Corporation ("RMMHC"), owner of a 99% general partnership interest in MuchMusic U.S.A. Venture, a New York general partnership ("MuchMusic"), is liquidated or merged into a limited liability company directly owned 100% by RMHI. Rainbow MM Holdings II Corporation ("R2MMHC"), owner of a 1% general partnership in MuchMusic, is liquidated or merged into a limited liability company directly owned 100% by RMHI. 2. Bravo adopts a limited liability company agreement of IFC to provide for an 80% managing member and a 20% non-managing member. . 3. BHC recapitalizes its equity into Class A common stock (with greater than 80% vote) and Class B common stock and authorized but unissued preferred stock convertible into Class B common stock (with less than 20% vote). The form of amended and restated certificate of incorporation of BHC is attached hereto as Exhibit D-1. The aggregate value of the BHC Class A Stock would be based on the value of the Cablevision Shares and the aggregate value of the BHC Class B Stock would be based on the value of the RMHI Shares. 4. Bravo transfers the $2.2 million receivable from Adelphia Communications Corporation, which is included in the IFC Assets, to IFC, as a contribution to capital. Bravo distributes all of its cash-on-hand 20% to MGM Holdings and 80% to BHC and B2HC, collectively. 5. Bravo distributes its 80% managing membership interest in IFC to B2HC in partial redemption of B2HC's interest in Bravo. Bravo transfers its 20% non-managing membership interest in IFC to MGM Holdings in partial redemption of MGM Holdings' interest in Bravo. As a result of this Step 5, IFC is owned 80% by B2HC and 20% by MGM Holdings and Bravo is owned 80% by BHC and B2HC, collectively, and 20% by MGM Holdings. 6. B2HC contributes its 80% managing member interest in IFC to a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, IFC Holding Corporation ("IFC Holding") in consideration of the issuance of 100% of IFC Holding's outstanding capital stock to B2HC. B2HC thereafter distributes its interest in IFC Holding to Rainbow Media Group, LLC ("RMG LLC"). 7. Value Adjustments (a) If after the Cablevision Valuation Period has concluded, the Share Value exceeds the BHC Closing Value, B2HC shall distribute to RMG LLC, and RMG LLC -74-
shall contribute to BHC, demand promissory notes of B2HC in an amount sufficient to cause the BHC Closing Value to equal the Share Value; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the B2HC demand promissory notes shall be capped at an amount that reduces RHMI's tax basis in B2HC to zero. If the Share Value continues to exceed the BHC Closing Value after giving effect to the demand promissory note distribution, then B2HC shall distribute to RMG LLC, and RMG LLC shall contribute to BHC, a portion of the B2HC Bravo Interest sufficient to cause the BHC Closing Value to equal the Share Value. If the value of the demand promissory notes and the B2HC Bravo Interest is greater than 10% of the value of B2HC, Section 2.07 of the Agreement shall apply. (b) If after the Cablevision Valuation Period has concluded, the Share Value is less than the BHC Closing Value, BHC shall distribute to RMG LLC, and RMG LLC shall contribute to B2HC, demand promissory notes of BHC in an amount sufficient to cause the BHC Closing Value to equal the Share Value; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the demand promissory notes shall be capped at an amount that reduces RMHI's basis in BHC to zero. If the BHC Closing Value continues to exceed the Share Value after giving effect to the demand promissory note distribution, then BHC shall distribute to RMG LLC, and RMG LLC shall contribute to B2HC, a portion of the BHC Bravo Interest sufficient to cause the BHC Closing Value to equal the Share Value. "Share Value" means the sum of (i) the Aggregate Cablevision Share Value (determined solely for this purpose by computing the Average Cablevision Share Price without regard to the proviso in the definition thereof), and (ii) the Aggregate RMHI Share Value (determined solely for this purpose by computing the Average Cablevision Share Price without regard to the proviso in the definition thereof). "BHC Closing Value" means the product of (i) the sum of (A) the Share Value and (B) the Aggregate GE Stock Consideration, and (ii) the BHC Percentage as of the time of such computation; and shall be increased by the value of any demand promissory notes of B2HC held by BHC at the time of such computation and decreased by the value of any outstanding BHC demand promissory notes. Part II: Implementation Steps: 8. NBC purchases the MGM Bravo Interest for cash pursuant to the MGM Agreement. Immediately thereafter, B2HC, BHC and NBC enter into an amended and restated partnership agreement of Bravo. A copy of the amended and restated partnership agreement is attached as Exhibit D-2. 9. GE Merger Sub is merged with and into B2HC, with B2HC being the Surviving Corporation, as provided in Section 2.01 of the Agreement. A copy of the Certificate of Merger is attached as Exhibit D-3. As a result of this step the Surviving Corporation becomes a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of GE. -75-
10. RMG LLC distributes all classes of BHC Shares held by it to RMHI. 11. RMHI distributes all classes of BHC Shares held by it to its shareholders, CSC Holdings and NBC Holdings. RMHI (i) transfers the BHC Class B Stock (low vote) to NBC Holdings in exchange for the RMHI shares held by NBC Holdings as provided in Section 2.02 of the Agreement and (ii) distributes the BHC Class A Stock (high vote) to CSC Holdings. 12. CSC Holdings distributes the BHC Class A Stock to Cablevision. 13. Cablevision distributes the BHC Class A Stock to NBC Holdings in exchange for the Cablevision Shares pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Agreement. As a result of this step, NBC and NBC Holdings no longer hold any equity interest in Cablevision or RHMI and GE Sub and NBC Holdings hold, through their ownership of the Surviving Corporation and BHC, 100% of Bravo. 14. Simultaneously with the spin-off transaction, BHC issues at least $20 million of the BHC Convertible Preferred Stock to an unrelated third party in an arm's length transaction. A copy of the term sheet for the BHC Convertible Preferred Stock is attached as Exhibit D-4. Capitalized terms which are not defined herein have the meaning assigned thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Exchange to which this Exhibit D relates. -76-

NBC TO ACQUIRE BRAVO FROM CABLEVISION SYSTEMS... NBC 11/04/2002 NBC TO ACQUIRE BRAVO FROM CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION Agreement Underscores NBC's Commitment to Expand Cable Presence Total Number of Cablevision Outstanding Shares to Decline by 16%; MGM to Receive Cash for its 20% Interest NEW YORK - November 4, 2002 - NBC and Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) announced today that they have reached an agreement for NBC to acquire Bravo, the Film and Arts Network, for $1.25 billion. The proceeds will be divided between Cablevision and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (NYSE:MGM), which currently own 80% and 20% of Bravo, respectively. Bravo reaches more than 68 million households nationwide and delivers one of the most upscale audiences of any cable entertainment network. For NBC, the purchase expands and strengthens its cable presence. NBC will now have three national cable properties, including MSNBC and CNBC, in addition to minority stakes in ValueVision (ShopNBC), the A&E Network and the History Channel. For Cablevision, the sale of Bravo highlights the value of this important asset and reduces debt. In addition, Cablevision's redemption of NBC's shares will decrease the number of shares outstanding of Cablevision common stock on a fully converted, fully diluted basis from approximately 333 million to approximately 280 million. Cablevision's 80% interest will be payable in GE stock and in 53.2 million shares of Cablevision Class A common stock, or approximately 16% of Cablevision common stock, presently held by NBC on a fully converted, fully diluted basis. NBC will purchase MGM's 20% interest in Bravo for $250 million in cash. "It has long been our goal to expand NBC's cable reach into entertainment. Bravo, with its desirable demographic, is a perfect strategic addition to our portfolio, providing a particularly good fit with NBC's network and cable viewers," said Bob Wright, Vice Chairman of General Electric and Chairman and CEO of NBC. "Cablevision and Rainbow have been valued partners to NBC and we look forward to working closely with them on future business endeavors." "Our talented management team at Bravo has created and developed a first-rate programming service as well as an important and valuable asset," said James L. Dolan, Cablevision President and CEO. "While parting with Bravo is tremendously difficult, we know of no better new home for the network than with our long-term partners at NBC. We have no doubt that great things are ahead for Bravo," Mr. Dolan concluded. "We are always looking for smart, strategic and financially savvy ways to grow our business," said Andrew Lack, President and COO of NBC. "Bravo is a strong fit with NBC across all functions. By sharing programming and resources, there will be tremendous opportunities for us to build on the network's success." Added Alex Yemenidjian, Chairman and CEO, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc: "We are
extremely pleased to join in a transaction that so clearly underscores Bravo's inherent value. The Rainbow entertainment networks continue to perform exceptionally well and their outlook remains very bright." The addition of Bravo significantly strengthens NBC's cable portfolio, adding a well-branded entertainment outlet to the company's cable assets. The combination creates strategic opportunities across many divisions including multi-platform advertising sales and promotion, news, entertainment and sports programming. NBC Studios and NBC Enterprises now have the opportunity to develop original NBC/Bravo crossover projects, including reality shows, new series and specials. NBC News' archives could be used for the creation of documentaries and entertainment programming, as well as to support existing programs such as "Bravo Profiles" and "Inside the Actors Studio." Additionally, Bravo will have the opportunity to participate with NBC on major events, specials and awards show programs. As part of the NBC family, Bravo will also have greater opportunities for movie acquisitions. Launched in December 1980, Bravo is home to creativity on television. It was the first service dedicated to film and the performing arts, and a pioneer in the early days of cable programming. Its schedule features original programming, feature films, theater, dance, music and documentaries. Supporting its theme "Not Your Everyday... Every Day on Bravo," the network boasts critically acclaimed original programming including "Inside the Actors Studio," "Bravo Profiles," "The It Factor," and "Musicians," as well as original mini-series including "Nicholas Nickleby," "The Red and The Black," and "The Scarlet Pimpernel."
