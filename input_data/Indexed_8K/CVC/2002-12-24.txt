If Sellers object to any amounts reflected on the Working Capital Schedule, Sellers must, within 20 business days after Sellers' receipt thereof, give written notice (the "Dispute Notice") to Buyer specifying in reasonable detail Sellers' objections. If Sellers have not given a Dispute Notice with respect to the Working Capital Schedule by the end of the 20 business day period after Sellers have received such Working Capital Schedule, Buyer's determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.

(d) With respect to any disputed amounts concerning the Working Capital Schedule, the parties shall meet in person and negotiate in good faith during the 20 business day period (the "Resolution Period") after the date of Buyer's receipt of the Dispute Notice to resolve any such disputes. If the parties are unable to resolve all such disputes within the Resolution Period, then at any time thereafter, either party may -7-
require that the disputes be submitted to an independent accounting firm, to be mutually and reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers (the "Independent Accountant"), such action to be triggered by the requesting party providing written notice to the other party (an "Auditor Notice"). In the event an Auditor Notice is given, the Independent Accountant shall be engaged to provide a final and conclusive resolution of all unresolved disputes within 45 days after such engagement, which resolution shall be based on the express provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that if the Independent Accountant finds the express terms of this Agreement are not sufficient to resolve any issue or issues, the Independent Accountant shall rely upon GAAP as then in effect. The determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto, and the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the party who is not the substantially prevailing party, as determined by the Independent Accountant based on the Independent Accountant's resolution of the issues. If the Independent Accountant is unable to make a determination of which party is the substantially prevailing party, Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall share the expenses of the Independent Accountant equally. (e) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Sellers and their representatives (and the Independent Accountant, if one has been appointed), upon reasonable notice, with free and full access to the books, records and personnel of Buyer reasonably requested by Sellers or their representatives (or the Independent Accountants) to assist Sellers or their representatives (or the Independent Accountants) in the review of the Working Capital Schedule or resolution of any disputes relating thereto. (f) The Working Capital Schedule shall set forth the (x) Current Assets and Current Liabilities of Sellers existing as of the opening of business on the Closing Date, (y) extent to which such Current Liabilities exceed Current Assets as of the opening of business on the Closing Date, and (z) the amount that such excess was less than or greater than the Reference Number. For clarification purposes, Schedule 2.03(f) sets forth the format for the Working Capital Schedule. (g) In the event the Purchase Price Adjustment (as finally determined in accordance with the provisions set forth above) differs from the Initial Adjustments Amount: (i) if the Current Liabilities minus Current Assets plus the Initial Adjustments Amount (if the Initial Adjustments Amount was made in Sellers' favor) or minus the Initial Adjustments Amount (if the Initial Adjustments Amount was made in Buyer's favor) (the "Final Calculation") is less than the Reference Number, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount by which the Reference Number exceeds the Final Calculation; and (ii) if the Final Calculation is greater than the Reference Number, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Final Calculation exceeds the Reference Number. All payments hereunder shall be paid promptly (within five business days) in immediately available funds. All references in this Section 2.03(g) to Current Liabilities or Current Assets shall be to the Current Liabilities or Current Assets, as the case may be, -8-
set forth in the Working Capital Schedule as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.03.

(i) Current Liabilities shall mean all liabilities, obligations and commitments that relate to the PCS Assets and are of a type determined to be "current liabilities" in accordance with GAAP as of the Closing Date, and shall for purposes hereof include the Clearance Liabilities whether or not they constitute current liabilities in accordance with GAAP. 2.04 Payment of Purchase Price and Assumption of Liabilities. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) pay towards the Purchase Price, to Sellers, an amount equal to the Preliminary Purchase Price, minus the FCC Payoff Amount, minus the amount of the Escrow Deposit, and less or plus the amount of any Initial Adjustments Amount (the "Sellers' Closing Payment"), payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account(s) as Sellers shall designate prior to the Closing Date, (ii) pay to the FCC, the FCC Payoff Amount, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts(s) as the FCC shall designate prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) assume and agree to pay, discharge and perform the Assumed Liabilities as and when due in accordance with the assumption agreement attached as Exhibit C hereto (the "Assumption Agreement"). 2.05 Escrow. (a) Deposit in Escrow. Concurrently with the Closing, Buyer shall deposit in escrow (the "Escrow Deposit") with the Escrow Agent $60,000,000 (such amount and any proceeds and including interest accrued thereon and any additions, substitutions or other property in which the same may be invested to be referred to herein as the "Escrow Fund"), to be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be used to satisfy the Sellers' obligations to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Buyer Parties harmless pursuant to Article 10 of this Agreement. (b) Settlement of Escrow.

In the event that at any time after the date hereof Buyer or Sellers, or any of their respective affiliates, take any action or enter into any transaction that would have the effect of materially impeding, delaying or preventing the receipt of any regulatory approvals necessary to effect the assignments to Buyer of the Contracts and the PCS Licenses pursuant to this Agreement, such party or parties shall use its or their best efforts to eliminate or otherwise mitigate as fully as possible any such adverse effect on obtaining such approvals. 9.04 Records, Taxes and Related Matters. Sellers and Buyer shall each make their respective books and records (including work papers in the possession of their respective accountants) available for inspection by the other parties, or by their duly authorized representatives, for reasonable business purposes at all reasonable times during normal business hours, for a seven-year period after the Closing Date with respect to all transactions relating to the PCS Assets occurring prior to or relating to the Closing, and the historical financial condition, assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the business conducted in connection with PCS Assets for any period prior to the Closing. In the case of records owned by Sellers, such records shall be made available at the relevant Seller's executive office, and in the case of records owned by Buyer, such records shall be made available at the office at which such records are maintained. As used in this Section 9.04, the right of inspection includes the right to make copies for reasonable business purposes. 9.05 Non-Assignment. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein (but not in limitation of Sellers' obligations under Section 9.03 or the conditions set forth in Section 7.01) but subject to Sellers' right to terminate cell site leases pursuant to Section 5.06, Sellers shall not assign to Buyer at Closing any Contract which provides that it may not be assigned without the consent of the other party thereto and for which such consent is not obtained, but in any such event, Sellers shall, to the extent reasonably necessary and at Buyer's cost, cooperate with Buyer in any commercially reasonable arrangement designed to provide the benefits thereof to Buyer. 9.06 Access by Sellers. Subsequent to the Closing, Buyer shall preserve and provide Sellers reasonable access during normal business hours to all of the books, reports, records, PCS -22-
Licenses and Contracts from files and records transferred to Buyer at the time of Closing, for the purposes of the preparation of tax returns, the defense of any claims asserted or which may be asserted with respect to which any Seller is the Indemnitor as contemplated by the Agreement, or other proper business purposes. Buyer shall give Sellers prior written notice of any intended destruction or disposal of any such books, reports, records, PCS Licenses and Contracts and, at Sellers' request, shall deliver any such books, reports, records, PCS Licenses and Contracts to Sellers, provided that Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred for copying and shipping. 10. Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Other Agreements; Indemnification. 10.01 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of one year, and shall thereafter terminate. Any claim by an Indemnitee against Sellers based upon breach of any such representation or warranty made pursuant to this Article 10 must be submitted to the Indemnitor prior to or at the expiration of the survival period, and in the case of claims for indemnification against Sellers, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement. There shall be no remedy, under this Agreement or otherwise, for any claim made by an Indemnitee for breaches of representations or warranties following the survival period. In the case of any claim submitted within such time period, the right of the Indemnitee to recover from the Indemnitor with respect to such claim shall not be dependent on the claim being resolved or the Losses being incurred within such time period. Notwithstanding any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the decision of any party to complete the Closing, each party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein. The waiver of any condition regarding the accuracy of any representation or warranty, regarding the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation or regarding any other matter, will not affect the right of indemnification of the waiving party after the Closing based on the inaccuracy of such representation or warranty or the nonperformance of or noncompliance with such covenant or obligation, provided, however, that Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers following its discovery (through actual knowledge) of such inaccuracy of such representation or warranty or such nonperformance of or noncompliance with such covenant or obligation. 10.02 Indemnification by Sellers. (a) Indemnity. Subject to Section 10.01, and Section 10.02(b), Sellers agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, members, partners, employees, agents, successors and assigns (an "Indemnified Buyer Party"), for, from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies or obligations, including, without limitation, all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, judgments, assessments, fines, interest, penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, settlement costs and reasonable legal fees) (collectively, "Losses") to which they may become subject, incur or suffer as a result of (i) the Excluded Liabilities, (ii) any and all misrepresentations or breaches of a representation or warranty of Sellers set forth in Article 3, or (iii) the nonperformance or breach of any covenants or agreements of Sellers contained herein or in the Ancillary Documents. All references to the terms "material," "materially," "materiality," "in all material respects," "material adverse effect," "Material Adverse Effect" and similar -23-
qualifications as to materiality contained in any representation or warranty of Sellers shall be ignored for purposes of Section 10.02(a)(ii). (b) Payment from Escrow Fund. (i) If any Indemnified Buyer Party shall become entitled to any payments from the Sellers with respect to any matter for which the Sellers have indemnified such party hereunder, such Indemnified Buyer Party shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Fund (and in the case of breaches of representations and warranties, only to the extent thereof) a cash payment equal to the amount due to such Indemnified Buyer Party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. The amount of such payment (and adjustment) shall be equal to the amount of Loss incurred by the Indemnified Buyer Party on account of the matter for which indemnification is required hereunder, less the net amount of any payments made or to be made to the Indemnified Buyer Party under any insurance, indemnity or similar policy or arrangement. Following the distribution of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, payments to be made by Sellers to an Indemnified Buyer Party pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) or Section 10.02(a)(iii) shall be made by the Sellers. (ii) Buyer acknowledges that except as provided by Section 13.13 its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10 and Buyer hereby waives, on behalf of itself and all other Indemnified Buyer Parties, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Sellers or any of their respective affiliates, members, directors, officers or employees arising under or based upon any law or arising under or based upon common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10), provided, however, that nothing in this Article 10 shall limit any claim Buyer may have in respect of fraud. (c) Any obligations of the Sellers under this Section 10 shall represent a retrospective adjustment to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the indemnification provided pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(ii) shall only apply to the extent that, and not until, the aggregate of all amounts subject to indemnification under Section 10.02(a)(ii) exceeds $7,500,000 (the "Deductible") and as to any particular indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims under Section 10.02(a)(ii) only to the extent that, and only if, such indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims equals or exceeds $25,000 (the "De Minimis"). In any event, the maximum, and only, amount that all Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to in respect of all claims by all parties pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(ii) is the amount of the Escrow Fund. 10.03 Indemnification by Buyer. (a) Indemnity. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (an "Indemnified Seller Party"), from -24-
and against all Losses to which they may become subject, incur or suffer as a result of (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any and all misrepresentations or breaches of a representation or warranty set forth in Article 4 or in any Ancillary Document or (iii) the nonperformance or breach of any covenants or agreements of Buyer contained. All references to the terms "material", "materially", "materiality", "in all material respects", "material adverse effect" and similar qualifications as to materiality contained in any representation or warranty of Buyer shall be ignored for purposes of Section 10.03(a)(ii). (b) Payment. Any obligations of Buyer under the provisions of this Article 10 shall be paid promptly to the applicable Indemnified Seller Party by Buyer and shall represent a retrospective adjustment to the Purchase Price. The amount of such payment (and adjustment) shall be equal to the amount of the Loss incurred by such Indemnified Seller Party on account of the matter for which indemnification is required hereunder, less the net amount of any payments made or to be made to such Indemnified Seller Party under any insurance, indemnity or similar policy or arrangement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the indemnification provided above shall only apply to the extent that, and not until, the aggregate of all amounts subject to indemnification under this Section 10.03(a)(ii) exceeds the Deductible and as to any particular indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims only to the extent that, and only if, such indemnity claim or series of related indemnity claims equals or exceeds the De Minimis. In any event, the maximum amount that Buyer will be required to pay under this Section 10.03 in respect of all claims by all parties pursuant to Section 10.03(a)(ii) is $60,000,000. 10.04 Third Party Claims; Etc. (a) If any claim ("Asserted Claim") covered by the foregoing indemnities is asserted against any indemnified party ("Indemnitee"), it shall be a condition to the obligations under this Article that the Indemnitee shall promptly give the indemnifying party ("Indemnitor") notice thereof in accordance with Section 13.05. The Indemnitee shall give Indemnitor an opportunity to control negotiations toward resolution of such claim without the necessity of litigation, and, if litigation ensues, to defend the same with counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee, at Indemnitor's expense, and Indemnitee shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with such defense. In addition, the Indemnitee shall be permitted to join in the defense and settlement of the Asserted Claim and to employ counsel at its expense. If the Indemnitor fails to assume control of the negotiations prior to litigation or to defend such action within a reasonable time, Indemnitee shall be entitled, but not obligated, to assume control of such negotiations or defense of such action, and Indemnitor shall be liable to the Indemnitee for its expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith which Indemnitor shall promptly pay. Neither Indemnitor nor Indemnitee shall settle, compromise, or make any other disposition of any Asserted Claims, which would or might result in any liability to Indemnitee or Indemnitor, respectively, under this Article 10 without the written consent of Indemnitee or Indemnitor, respectively, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. (b) If an Asserted Claim occurs, the indemnification provided for in this Article 10 shall be the exclusive remedy of any party in respect of any inaccuracy in any representations and warranties contained herein. -25-
10.05 Replacement of Escrow Fund. At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, Sellers may elect to terminate the Escrow Agreement and replace the Escrow Fund with an irrevocable letter of credit, issued by a commercial banking institution reasonably acceptable to Buyer and in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, in amount and with such documentary conditions so as to duplicate mutatis mutandis the term and remaining amount of the Escrow Fund as the source of indemnification to the Indemnified Buyer Parties by Sellers under Section 10.02, in which case, upon the issuance of such letter of credit to and for the Buyer, as beneficiary, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Sellers the full balance of the Escrow Fund without regard to any amounts set forth in any outstanding Notice(s) of Claim (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), and references to the Escrow Fund in this Article 10 shall be deemed to refer to such letter of credit as the context so indicates. 11. Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, each party will execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and transfer, fully cooperate with the other party and take such other actions as the other party reasonably may request to effect the purposes and intent of this Agreement. Subsequent to the Closing, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a copy of any FCC lien release letter or other evidence supplied to Sellers by the FCC that the notes associated with the FCC Installment Payment Obligations have been cancelled. 12. Closing. 12.01 Closing. (a) The Closing shall take place at the offices of Sellers' outside counsel at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the fifth business day after all conditions to the sale as provided in Articles 7 and 8 have been satisfied other than those conditions which are to be satisfied at the Closing, but in contemplation of the satisfaction of such conditions (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that (i) if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to the first anniversary of the date hereof (as the same may be extended under Section 12.01(b), the "Outside Date"), this Agreement may be terminated by either Sellers or Buyer unless Section 12.01(b) applies (provided that the failure to achieve the Closing by the Outside Date has not proximately resulted from a material breach of this Agreement by a party seeking to terminate under this Section 12.01), and (ii) if the originally scheduled Outside Date is extended pursuant to Section 12.01(b) and the Closing shall not have occurred by the extended Outside Date, this Agreement may be terminated by either Sellers or Buyer (provided that the failure to achieve the Closing by the extended Outside Date has not proximately resulted from a material breach of this Agreement by a party seeking to terminate under this Section 12.01). (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the date hereof and prior to the originally scheduled Outside Date, Buyer or any of its affiliates (excluding any such affiliate that is a member of the Vodafone Group) enters into any agreement whereby it would acquire PCS licenses in any market covered by the PCS Licenses and Closing does not occur by such Outside Date solely by reason of the failure to obtain a Final Order evidencing the FCC's consent to the assignment of the PCS Licenses under this Agreement, Sellers may (so long as Sellers did not breach their obligations with respect to efforts to seek the FCC consent or approval under Section 9.03), at their election, -26-
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Buyer on or prior to the originally scheduled Outside Date. If Sellers do not elect to so terminate the Agreement, Buyer may, at its election, terminate this Agreement by written notice to Sellers within two business days after the receipt of Sellers' written notice or the originally scheduled Outside Date, as applicable. If Buyer does not elect to so terminate the Agreement, the Outside Date shall be extended by six months (and for purposes of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall be the Outside Date as so extended) and, if the Closing occurs, at the Closing Buyer shall pay to Sellers in addition to the Purchase Price interest accrued on the Purchase Price from the period starting on the first anniversary of the date hereof through and including the Closing Date at an annual rate of 10%. If Buyer elects to so terminate the Agreement, Sellers shall use all reasonable commercial efforts in good faith to sell the PCS Assets (or substantially all of the PCS Assets) as expeditiously as reasonably possible to a bona fide purchaser unaffiliated to Sellers with a view to maximizing value, it being understood that the foregoing will not require the Sellers to enter into any obligations more burdensome in the aggregate than those contained in this Agreement (the "Second Transaction"), and at the consummation of such Second Transaction Buyer shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of $750,000,000 together with interest accrued thereon from the date this Agreement is terminated through and including the closing date of such Second Transaction at an annual rate of 10% and (ii) the purchase price paid to Sellers in such Second Transaction. (c) If, as of the Outside Date, the Agreement is so terminated by either Sellers or Buyer under Sections 12.01(a) or (b), all parties hereto shall be released from all obligations hereunder, other than obligations under the second sentence of Section 5.02 (and the Confidentiality Agreement referred to therein), the last sentence of Section 12.01(b) and Section 13.10, and each party hereto will bear expenses as provided in Section 13.06 hereof, provided that no such termination shall release any party from any obligation arising from a breach or default hereunder prior to such termination. (d) At the Closing, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver all instruments and documents as shall be necessary in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the respective parties to consummate the transactions contemplated herein. 12.02 Termination. In addition to the termination provided for in Section 12.01, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned (provided, however, that no such termination shall release any party from any obligations arising from a breach or default hereunder prior to such termination): (a) At any time, by the mutual written agreement of Buyer and Sellers; (b) By Buyer, upon and effective as of the date of written notice to Seller, if events occur or conditions exist which would render impossible the satisfaction of one or more conditions to the obligation of the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in Article 7, and the impossibility of the satisfaction of such condition(s) has not proximately resulted from the Buyer's material breach of this Agreement; -27-
(c) By Sellers, upon and effective as of the date of written notice to Buyer, if events occur or conditions exist which would render impossible the satisfaction of one or more conditions to the obligation of the Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as set forth in Article 8, and the impossibility of the satisfaction of such condition(s) has not proximately resulted from the Sellers' material breach of this Agreement; (d) By Buyer, at any time if Sellers failed to comply in any material respect with any of the covenants or obligations set forth herein, provided that Buyer shall have promptly given Sellers written notice of the same and Sellers shall not have cured same within 30 days of receipt of said notice; (e) By Sellers, at any time if Buyers failed to comply in any material respect with any of the covenants or obligations set forth herein, provided that Sellers shall have promptly given Buyer written notice of the same and Buyer shall not have cured same within 30 days of receipt of said notice; or (f) By Sellers or Buyer, upon and effective as of the date of written notice to the other, pursuant to the termination provisions of Section 9.02(c). 13. Miscellaneous. 13.01 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally and no waiver of compliance with any provision or condition hereof and no consent provided for herein shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing duly executed by the party hereto sought to be charged with such waiver or consent. No waiver of any term or provision hereof shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such term or provision or any other term or provision. Any condition to the performance of any party hereto which may legally be waived at or prior to the Closing may be waived in writing at any time by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. 13.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements, memoranda, arrangements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in Section 5.02. No representation, warranty, promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by any party which is not contained in this Agreement, and no party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained herein or therein. 13.03 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned other than (a) with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, or (b) after the Closing to a Person that acquires all or substantially all of a party's assets and assumes all of the party's obligations hereunder, including by way of merger, consolidation, transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets and liabilities, or otherwise. Any purported assignment made other than as provided in this Section 13.03 shall be null and void. 13.04 Construction; Counterparts. The Article and Section headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and do not form a part hereof and do not in any way -28-
modify, interpret or construe the intentions of the parties. This Agreement may be executed in one or more separate counterparts, and all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument. 13.05 Notices. All notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given to a party when delivered in person, faxed (with confirmation) or three business days after such notice is enclosed in a properly sealed envelope, certified or registered, and deposited (postage and certification or registration prepaid) in a post office or collection facility regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service, or one business day after delivery to a nationally recognized overnight courier service, and addressed as follows: If to Sellers: Northcoast Communications, L.L.C.

Sellers acknowledge and agree that the PCS Assets, including without limitation the PCS Licenses, are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event of a breach by Sellers in the performance of their obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, Sellers agree that in the event of any such breach by Sellers, Buyer shall be entitled to a decree of specific performance pursuant to which the Sellers are ordered to affirmatively carry out its obligations under this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond. 13.14 Specific Performance for Sellers. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the PCS Assets, including without limitation the PCS Licenses, are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event of a breach by Buyer in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
