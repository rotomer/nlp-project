First quarter 2003 net revenues grew 10% to $35.5 million, operating income rose 18% to $6.9 million, and Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% to $9.7 million compared to the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $14.2 million compared to $9.3 million in the prior year period.  The lower operating loss and the 54% increase in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter were primarily due to a decrease in luxury tax expense related to the NY Knicks, partly offset by higher player compensation.
 
Assets Held For Sale
The operating results for the theatres, retail electronics and Bravo network have been reported as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the company's condensed consolidated operations data for all periods presented.
 
The company continues to evaluate alternatives for the Clearview Cinemas theatre chain.  Thus far, two transactions have taken place, netting proceeds of approximately $28.0 million, which was used to reduce the company's bank debt.

Verizon Wireless to Purchase Northcoast Communications Spectrum Licenses

2003 Outlook
 
The company expects to achieve its previous guidance provided on February 11, 2003 except for:
Telecommunications Services Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to grow between 16% and 18%, down from 18% to 20%.  This is primarily due to higher programming costs related to the YES transaction.
 - 
                 
Capital expenditures for Telecommunications Services and Corporate between $750 and $775 million, up from $725 million, due to higher second set digital box penetration resulting from strong acceptance by customers for the new digital video offering.
 - 
                 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define Adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present "Adjusted EBITDA" as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with other titles is a common performance measure used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Operating Income, please see page 7 of this release.
 
The Adjusted EBITDA results for the first quarters of 2003 and 2002 include $5.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in expenses related to the company's long-term incentive plan.  This expense had previously been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.  This change has been made in conjunction with the requirements set forth in the recently enacted Regulation G, which regulates the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the schedules on pages 12 and 13 that adjust the quarterly results for 2002 for such expense.
