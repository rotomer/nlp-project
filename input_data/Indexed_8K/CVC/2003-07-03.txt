             On June 18, 2003, Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") announced that an internal review initiated by the Company identified improper expense accruals at the national services division of Cablevision's Rainbow Media Group. The improper accruals identified to date are insignificant to the previously reported financial results of Cablevision and Rainbow. Prior to the June 18 announcement, the Company notified the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York of the matter, including issues relating to the conduct of certain individuals involved in the matter. The Company also announced on June 18, 2003 that its Audit Committee had retained William McLucas of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering to conduct an investigation of the matter. Wilmer Cutler & Pickering subsequently has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers as forensic accountants. On July 3, 2003, the Company received a formal order of investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as a subpoena in connection with their investigation. The Company cannot predict how long these investigations will last or their outcome. The Company is cooperating fully and intends to continue to do so.
