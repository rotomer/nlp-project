- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.  The company also announced that it will restate its previously issued 2003 quarterly financial statements and will revise the quarterly financial results announced today to reflect the impact of the total of approximately $15 million of expenses that were improperly recorded in 2002 and earlier periods.  The results announced today do not include the effects of the restatement and revision, which is currently in progress and is expected to be completed no later than the end of November 2003.
Bethpage, N.Y., November 11, 2003
 
third quarter net revenues increased 12% to $975.8 million compared to $872.4 million in the prior year period.  Consolidated operating income totaled $24.2 million, up from $10.5 million in the comparable 2002 period due to the 12% increase in revenue and the incurrence of a $72.0 million restructuring charge in the prior year period compared to $8 million in the current period, offset by a 32% increase in depreciation and amortization expense in this year's period.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow grew 4% to $315.6 million from $302.1 million in the year-ago period.  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 7 for a discussion of our use of "AOCF" as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 9 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income and net loss.
Consolidated
 
third quarter net revenues rose 15% over the comparable quarter in 2002 to $693.5 million driven by continued strong customer demand for the company's digital video and high-speed data services.  Operating income increased 17% to $76.8 million due to strong consumer services revenue growth over the prior year period and a $42.1 million restructuring charge taken in the third quarter 2002, offset by a 40% increase in depreciation and amortization in this year's period.  Third quarter AOCF increased 9% over the comparable 2002 quarter to $276.7 million and includes $6.1 million of legal and indemnification expenses related to the agreement with the YES Network.  The AOCF increase primarily reflects continued strong customer and resulting revenue growth from Optimum Online, the company's high-speed data service.  Excluding YES related expenses, Telecommunications Services AOCF increased 11% for the quarter.
Telecommunications Services
 
(AMC, IFC (The Independent Film Channel), WE: Women's Entertainment and Consolidated Regional Sports) third quarter net revenues increased 17% to $149.7 million.  Operating income rose 54% to $59.8 million and AOCF increased 45% to $67.9 million, each compared to the year-earlier quarter.  The Core Network's affiliate fee revenue and AMC's and WE's combined advertising revenue more than doubling from the prior year period were the primary reasons for the strong growth in revenue, operating income and AOCF.  The Core Network's third quarter 2003 results
Rainbow Media's Core Networks'
include proceeds of $8.5 million relating to receivables from Adelphia Communications previously written off.  Excluding the sale of the receivable from the third quarter's results, operating income and AOCF increased 32% and 26%, respectively.
 
"In the third quarter, Cablevision's cable, Lightpath and high-speed businesses demonstrated strong top line growth driven, in large part, by ongoing consumer demand.  Digital television growth remained solid with the addition of nearly 160,000 customers in the quarter, while Optimum Online is now providing service to more than one million customers while enjoying the industry's highest penetration rate at more than 23%.  Adding to the strength displayed by our now-established digital services is yet another compelling product, Optimum Voice, which is now fully deployed across Cablevision's entire digital footprint of more than 4 million homes."
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented: 
 
Mr. Dolan continued: "Rainbow Media's core networks continued to generate notable results, reporting a 17% increase in revenue and a 45% increase in adjusted operating cash flow.  This success is due to higher affiliate fee revenue and outstanding growth in advertising revenue, especially by AMC and WE, which more than doubled their advertising revenue in the past year."
 
"Finally, we intend to move forward with our plan to spin off Rainbow DBS and Rainbow Media's national entertainment services and thus, Cablevision will become two distinct companies, logically organized, with defined strategies and enhanced clarity for investors," Mr. Dolan concluded.

AOCF margin of 39.9% compared to 38.3% at June 30, 2003.  The September 2002 AOCF margin of 41.6% reflects expense savings associated with the reversal of management bonuses.

The results announced today do not include the effects of the restatement and revision which is currently in progress.

The strong growth was due primarily to higher affiliate fee revenue at WE and IFC and the combined advertising revenue for AMC and WE more than doubling compared to the prior year period. 
The third quarter 2003 results include sale proceeds of $4.3 million for an Adelphia Communications receivable owed to AMC, IFC and WE that was previously written off.   Excluding the sale of the receivable from the third quarter results, operating income and AOCF increased 45% and 37%, respectively.

Consolidated Regional Sports
Consolidated Regional Sports is comprised of Fox Sports Net Florida and Fox Sports Net Ohio, both of which are 60% owned by Rainbow.  Third quarter 2003 net revenues grew 4% to $42.7 million and operating income rose 41% to $16.9 million each compared to the year earlier period.  AOCF rose 33% to $19.6 million compared to the prior year period.  The third quarter 2003 results include sale proceeds of $4.2 million for an Adelphia Communications receivable owed to Consolidated Regional Sports.  Excluding the sale of the receivable from the third quarter results, operating income and AOCF increased 5% and 4%, respectively, primarily due to lower advertising revenue and higher contractual rights payments.

(Fox Sports Net Chicago, Bay Area and New England)
Third quarter net revenues grew 9% to $63.3 million. 
Operating income increased 15% to $14.1 million and
AOCF rose 13% to $15.1 million, due primarily to a 6% increase in affiliate fee revenue and a 24% increase in advertising revenue compared to the year-earlier period.

The increase in revenue is primarily due to new film releases at IFC Films, a $1.2 million collection of a receivable previously written off at IFC Productionsand increases in advertising revenue at fuse.  The lower operating loss and AOCF deficit was attributable to the aforementioned revenue increases coupled with lower programming and production costs at Metro TV, and further expense reductions at both Mag Rack and News 12 Networks.
 
 
Rainbow DBS - VOOM
The satellite services division reported, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2003, an operating loss of $29.5 million compared to a $0.9 million loss in the prior year period.  AOCF deficit was $29.5 million for the quarter, compared to $0.9 million in the year-earlier period.  The increased operating loss and AOCF deficit was attributable to programming development expenses, research and development expenses, marketing expenses and administrative costs.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's businesses include MSG Network, Fox Sports Net New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex, and Radio City Music Hall.  Third quarter 2003 net revenue totaled $107.8 million, an 8% decrease from the prior year period due primarily to lower event revenue at Radio City Entertainment and lower advertising revenue at MSG Network.  Operating profit for the quarter was $4.3 million compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2002.  AOCF for the quarter was $16.3 million compared to $15.8 million in the prior year period.

In addition, recurring costs could be up to an additional $20 million.

Investigation of Improper Expense Accruals at the National Services Division of Rainbow Media
 
On June 18, 2003, Cablevision Systems Corporation announced that an internal review initiated by the company identified improperly recorded expenses at the national services division of Cablevision's Rainbow Media Group.  At the time of the June 18 announcement, the review had found that $6.2 million of expenses for 2003 were accelerated and improperly accrued or expensed in 2002, rather than 2003.  All but $1.7 million of that pre-tax amount was identified and reversed prior to the release of the company's 2002 results.  The company also stated that, based on the review prior to the June 18 announcement, it believed that improper expenses recorded in 2000 and 2001 were similar in size to those in 2002.
 
The company also announced on June 18, 2003 that its Audit Committee had retained Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering to conduct an investigation of the matter.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering subsequently retained PricewaterhouseCoopers as forensic accountants.
 
In August 2003, the company announced that Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering reported to the audit committee and management of the company that its investigation to that date had identified, in addition to the amounts announced by the company on June 18, 2003, improperly recognized expenses at the original productions units within the AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment business units of the national services division of Rainbow Media Holdings and that pre-tax amounts that should have been expensed in 2003 that were expensed in earlier years equaled approximately $3.4 million.
 
The Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering investigation is continuing and covers all significant operating units within Rainbow Media Holdings, as well as the Telecommunications, Madison Square Garden, and Corporate segments.  The investigation includes a thorough financial evaluation of the facts relating to improper expense recognition and suggestions for improvement of the company's internal controls.
 
In November 2003, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering reported that it has substantially completed its detailed review of year-end expenses that may have been improperly accelerated.  With respect to Rainbow Media Holdings, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has reported that it has identified, in addition to the amounts reported in June and August 2003, additional improperly accelerated expenses at AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment and at most other business units within Rainbow Media Holdings.  For AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment, the additional pre-tax amounts that should have been expensed in 2003 that were expensed in earlier years equaled approximately $3.8 million, and for the other Rainbow business units equaled approximately $5.0 million, including $0.7 million in non-consolidated businesses.  The improperly recognized expenses in the Rainbow business units primarily relate to sales and marketing, original production and event production activities.  With respect to the non-Rainbow Media Holdings' units of the company, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has further reported that it has identified approximately $1.3 million in accelerated expenses that should have been recorded in 2003, the majority of which consist
of sales and marketing, maintenance and consulting expenses.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering's work is continuing and additional amounts may be identified at Rainbow Media Holdings or at other business units of the company.
 
In light of the findings to date and current status of the Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering investigation, the company has decided that it will restate its previously reported financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2003, and will revise the quarterly financial results released today, to reflect the impact of the above referenced expenses totaling approximately $15 million that were improperly recorded in 2002 and earlier periods.  This restatement and revision, which is currently in progress and is expected to be completed no later than the end of November 2003, includes determining the adjustment to be recorded in each individual quarter of 2003.  In connection with the pending restatement, the company expects to obtain a waiver under the Rainbow Media Holdings and American Movie Classic credit facilities.
 
The company is also evaluating whether a restatement of any of the company's previously reported annual and quarterly results of operations for the years 2000 to 2002 may also be required.  Additionally, the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the improperly recognized expenses on the separate financial statements of its subsidiaries.  The company expects to finalize these evaluations by the time the investigation is complete.
 
KPMG has advised the company that, due to the status of the Wilmer Cutler & Pickering investigation, it is currently unable to complete its review of the company's consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2003.  KPMG took the same position with respect to the financial statements for the second quarter of 2003.
 
2003 Outlook
 
The company revises its full year 2003 guidance as follows:
 
Telecommunications Services
 - 
                 
Telecommunications AOCF growth of 12% from 14% to 16% and Telecommunications revenue growth between 11.5% and 12.5% from 12% to 14%.  The changes in guidance are primarily due to lower than expected video subscriber growth, primarily in New York City, as the rebuild was not completed in the third quarter as expected.  The company had anticipated complete activation in the third quarter, but it has been delayed until December 2003.  In addition, lower revenue per video subscriber is expected due to less video upgrade activity than anticipated, a shortfall in forecasted advertising revenue, and higher bad debt expense.  Higher field service operations costs and call center activity driven principally by new product offerings are also expected to contribute to the lower than anticipated 2003 adjusted operating cash flow.
 - 
                 
Basic video customer growth of between 0.25% and 0.50%, down from the previous guidance of a 0.50% increase for the full year.
 
Excluded from 2003 guidance are:
 - 
                 
Amounts that may be paid to the YES Network for certain revenue reductions and expenses that the YES Network might experience during the term of the one-year interim agreement.  Accrued indemnity claims and legal fees related to the YES agreement totaled $6.1 million in the third quarter ($1.4 million in legal fees and $4.7 million for indemnity claims).  The company is currently unable to forecast the amount of any further indemnity claims or legal fees for 2003.
 - 
                 
As previously announced, all investments in Rainbow DBS, in 2003 are not included in Total Company guidance for 2003.
 - 
                 
Amounts that may be required to be included in the nine months 2003 results as a result of the pending restatement and revision of such results discussed above.

Estimates below exclude, in the base year, a $16.3 million bad debt charge related to the Adelphia Communications bankruptcy filing recorded for the year 2002.
 
 
2004 Outlook
 
Although the 2004 business plan has not yet been fully completed, the company expects that based on the lower 2003 Total Telecommunications AOCF guidance, full year 2004 free cash flow will be modestly negative.  However, the company anticipates it will achieve free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2004. Further details regarding 2004 guidance are expected to be provided early in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In response to recent SEC guidance, the company will no longer use the term Adjusted EBITDA and will refer to this performance measure as adjusted operating cash flow.  This is a change in terminology only and the company has not changed the way it calculates this measure.
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present "adjusted operating cash flow" as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes adjusted operating cash flow is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted operating cash flow and similar measures with other titles is a common performance measure used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and adjusted operating cash flow measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted operating cash flow should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP").  Since adjusted operating cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, please see page 9 of this release.
