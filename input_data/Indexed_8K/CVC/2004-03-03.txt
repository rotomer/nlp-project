Provides 2004 Outlook
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2003.  Today's results include the effect of the restatement of the company's 2003 and 2002 results to record the effect of adjustments for amounts improperly recognized in earlier periods and certain other matters referred to in this release.
Bethpage, N.Y., March 2, 2004
 
fourth quarter net revenues increased 12% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period based on strong growth at the Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media Core Networks divisions.  Consolidated operating loss totaled $46.2 million, compared to operating income of $70.6 million in the prior year period.  The operating loss was primarily due to costs associated with the launch of VOOM, the company's direct broadcast satellite service, higher depreciation and amortization costs, and higher stock plan expenses. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter declined 19% to $249.9 million compared to the year-earlier period due to costs related to the launch of VOOM, and lower AOCF at both Rainbow Media and Madison Square Garden compared to the prior year period.  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 8 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 10 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).
Consolidated
 
Full year 2003 consolidated net revenue increased 10% to $4.2 billion, and AOCF rose 5% to $1.1 billion, both compared to full year 2002.  The revenue and AOCF increases were primarily due to continued strong growth from the Telecommunications Services and the Rainbow Media Core Networks businesses. Operating income totaled $31.6 million, an 83% decrease from the prior year period due to higher depreciation and amortization expense and employee stock plan expenses of $42.8 million compared to a credit in 2002 of $41.5 million.
 
fourth quarter 2003 net revenues rose 17% to $723.0 million compared to the prior year period.  Operating income decreased 6% to $64.9 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher employee stock plan expense. AOCF increased 10% over the comparable 2002 quarter to $272.7 million and includes $6.8 million of legal and indemnification expenses related to the agreement with the YES Network, and $17.2 million for reinstated 2003 management bonuses accrued entirely in the fourth quarter for the full year amount (no bonuses were paid for 2002).  The increase in revenue and AOCF primarily reflects continued strong customer demand for the company's high-speed data service and digital video service.  Excluding legal and indemnification expenses related to the agreement with the YES Network, and the 2003 management bonuses, Telecommunications Services AOCF increased 18% for the quarter to $296.7 million.
Telecommunications Services
Full year 2003 Telecommunications Services net revenues rose 12% to $2.7 billion compared to 2002.  Operating income for the full year decreased 23% to $239.9 million, while AOCF increased 10% to $1.0 billion, both compared to the prior year.  Operating income and AOCF both include $22.5 million of legal and indemnification expenses related to the agreement with the YES Network.
 
(AMC, IFC (The Independent Film Channel), WE: Women's Entertainment and Consolidated Regional Sports) fourth quarter net revenues increased 26% to $167.0 million.  Operating income decreased 42% to $24.5 million and AOCF decreased 9% to $46.5 million, each compared to the year-earlier quarter.  The decline in operating income and AOCF was primarily due to a $17.9 million write-down of certain film and programming contracts and $4.9 million of legal and audit expenses associated with the Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP investigation.  Excluding these expenses, AOCF increased 35% compared to the prior year period.
Rainbow Media's Core Networks
 
Full year 2003 Rainbow Media Core Networks net revenues increased 24% to $609.2 million compared to 2002.  Operating income for the full year increased 23% to $168.4 million and AOCF increased 37% to $225.9 million, both compared to the prior year.  Excluding a $17.9 million film and programming contracts write-off, and $11.0 million of investigation related expenses, AOCF increased 55% compared to 2002.
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision had a very strong 2003, highlighted by the completion of a system-wide upgrade of our state-of-the-art network.  This extraordinary accomplishment has helped spur our aggressive roll out of our products and services, resulting in excellent performance for our consumer telecommunications services.  The company also made significant progress in meeting key financial objectives including: the sale of non-core assets; enhanced liquidity; and, the simplification of our ownership structure in the Rainbow programming businesses."
 
Mr. Dolan continued:  "For the fourth quarter, the company's cable, Lightpath and high-speed businesses reported a 17% increase in net revenues.  This was driven largely by strong demand for Cablevision's iO: Interactive Optimum, which achieved a 31% penetration of video subscribers, and Optimum Online, which realized a 24% penetration of homes passed.  The newest addition to our consumer bundle, Optimum Voice, has already attracted 29,000 customers, and we look forward to its continued growth as well as that of video and high-speed data in 2004."
 
"Our Rainbow Media assets had a solid fourth quarter as well.  Strong programming continues to spark interest from advertisers, which resulted in a 26% increase in net revenues for our core networks.  In addition, Cablevision continues to move forward with its plan to spin-off Rainbow DBS along with Rainbow Media's three national networks, which we believe will provide greater clarity for shareholders by helping to further define the business strategies of both Cablevision and the new entity," Mr. Dolan concluded.

Consumer Services
Fourth quarter net revenues increased 16% to $679.0 million compared to the prior year period.  Operating income decreased 7% to $67.2 million due to higher depreciation and amortization expense and higher stock plan charges, and AOCF rose 9% to $252.9 million all compared to the year-earlier period.  Fourth quarter 2003 and 2002 AOCF includes $6.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of legal fees and indemnification expenses related to the company's agreement with the YES Network.  Fourth quarter 2003 AOCF also includes a $15.4 million expense for 2003 management bonuses accrued entirely in the fourth quarter for the full year amount.  Excluding these expenses for both periods, Consumer Services AOCF increased 17% in the fourth quarter.

AOCF margin of 37.2% compared to 39.7% at December 2002.  The fourth quarter pro forma AOCF margin, excluding the 2003 management bonuses and YES related expenses from both periods, was 40.5% compared to 40.3% for the fourth quarter of 2002.
 - 
                 
 
Business Services - Lightpath
Fourth quarter net revenues increased 9% to $45.6 million compared to the prior year period.  Operating loss decreased to $2.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.4 million in the prior year period.  AOCF rose 22% to $19.8 million, compared to the prior year period due to the collection of a $1 million receivable previously written-off, and to the favorable settlement of billing and interconnection carrier agreement disputes totaling $3 million.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow Media Holdings LLC (Rainbow), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, includes the following businesses:  AMC, IFC, WE, fuse, Mag Rack and five local News 12 Networks operating on Long Island, in New Jersey, Westchester, Connecticut and the Bronx, as well as three local MetroChannels and Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp.  Rainbow, through its 60% ownership interest in Regional Programming Partners (40% owned by Fox Sports), also owns interests in Madison Square Garden, Radio City Entertainment, and five regional Fox Sports Net channels outside the New York market, and Rainbow owns a 50% interest in the Fox Sports Net national service. 
 
AMC/IFC/WE
Fourth quarter 2003 net revenues increased 23% to $120.9 million, operating income decreased 52% to $16.4 million, and AOCF decreased 15% to $34.1 million, each compared to the year-ago period.  The decrease in operating income and AOCF was due to a $17.9 million write-down of certain film and programming contracts almost entirely at AMC, and $4.7 million of expenses related to the Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP investigation.  Excluding these costs, AMC, IFC and WE's AOCF increased 42% compared to the prior year period.  Fourth quarter combined AMC and WE advertising revenue increased 48% from the year-earlier period, and comprised
27% and 41% of AMC's and WE's total revenue, respectively.
 
Consolidated Regional Sports
Consolidated Regional Sports is comprised of Fox Sports Net Florida, Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area (Chicago and Bay Area were consolidated effective December 12, 2003) and are 60% owned by Rainbow.  Fourth quarter 2003 net revenues grew 38% to $46.1 million and operating income decreased 2% to $8.2 million each compared to the year-earlier period.  AOCF rose 10% to $12.4 million compared to the prior year period.  Fourth quarter pro forma revenue and AOCF, to reflect the consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area, increased 10% and 4%, respectively.
Developing Programming/Other
Developing Programming/Other consists of MagRack, fuse, Rainbow Network Communications, News 12 Networks, MetroChannels, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp., IFC Entertainment and other Rainbow start-up ventures.  Fourth quarter net revenues decreased 12% to $52.1 million, and the operating loss for the quarter totaled $39.9 million compared to $16.2 million for the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the quarter totaled $24.6 million compared to a $13.3 million deficit for the prior year period.  Revenue, operating income and AOCF each declined from the prior year period primarily due to the successful theatrical release in the fourth quarter of 2002 of Y Tu Mama Tambien.  Higher marketing expenses at fuse, and startup production expenses and programming acquisition costs associated with a new video-on-demand programming service  sportskool, also contributed to the reduction in operating income and AOCF.
 
Rainbow DBS  VOOM
 
On October 15, 2003, Cablevision's Rainbow DBS initiated the first satellite transmission of "VOOM", a new service oriented to HDTV viewing.  For the fourth quarter, the satellite services division reported an operating loss of $54.9 million compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million in the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the quarter was $47.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the year-earlier period.  The operating loss and AOCF deficit were attributable to costs associated with the launch of the VOOM service including marketing, administration, high definition channel development and systems integration expenses.  These costs were not offset by any revenues.
 
While affiliation arrangements for syndicated programming are being completed, and while various technical problems are being resolved, the company has limited its marketing program.  (As of the end of February, 1,627 customers were installed and receiving service.  No customers have yet been billed for service.)  With the recent completion of significant programming arrangements, and improved technical performance, the company is now undertaking a measured increase in its marketing efforts and is testing a variety of pricing alternatives.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's businesses include MSG Network, Fox Sports Net New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex, and Radio City Music Hall.  Madison Square Garden's fourth quarter revenue increased 3%, to $322.6 million, from the prior year period.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in live event revenue generated by Radio City Entertainment from the Christmas Spectacular and concerts.  This increase was somewhat offset by lower affiliate fee revenue at MSG Network due in part to the loss of the rights to broadcast the New Jersey Nets games, and lower MSG Network ad sales revenue.  Operating income for the quarter was $11.4 million compared to $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.   Fourth quarter AOCF decreased 24% to $28.1 million from the prior year period.  The decrease was primarily due to severance costs, higher team compensation costs, including NBA luxury tax, and higher theatrical development costs, offset in part by the strong performance of the Christmas shows.
 
Theatres
For the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, net revenue for Clearview Cinemas totaled $22.7 million, a 4% decline compared to the $23.6 million in the year-earlier period.  The operating loss was $0.7 million compared to operating income of $12.9 million in the prior year period.  Operating income in 2002 included a gain on disposal of fixed assets.  AOCF for the fourth quarter was $1.5 million versus $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Other 
The Other AOCF deficit totaled $26.6 million for the quarter compared to $15.8 million in the prior year period.  Other expense is comprised primarily of management bonuses and costs associated with the spin off of the Rainbow DBS businesses.
Recent Developments
Spin Off - Satellite Service and Three Rainbow Media National Entertainment Services
On October 23, 2003, Cablevision announced that its board of directors approved an amended plan to spin off Cablevision's satellite service (Rainbow DBS) on a tax-free basis to its shareholders.  The company has received a favorable ruling from the IRS regarding the tax-free status of the spin-off.  In addition to Rainbow DBS, the new spun off entity will include three of Rainbow Media's national entertainment services  AMC, IFC (The Independent Film Channel) and WE: Women's Entertainment  their subsidiaries, and certain other Rainbow businesses.  The company expects to file the requisite documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in the second quarter of 2004 and to complete the spin-off later this year.
 
Quadrangle Exercises its "Put" Option
In October 2003, Quadrangle Capital Partners LP exercised its "put option" to require CSC Holdings to purchase all of its Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock.  Terms of the agreement provide 60 days from the date of the exercise notice to elect delivery of cash or registered equity securities of Cablevision in settlement of the put right and, after making that election, an additional 30 days to pay if cash payment is elected and an additional 4 months to pay if Cablevision securities are elected.  We are currently in discussions with Quadrangle as to the process for determining the put price.
 
Investigation of Improper Expense Accruals and Other Adjustments
 
On June 18, 2003, Cablevision Systems Corporation announced that an internal review initiated by the company identified improperly recorded expenses at the national services division of Cablevision's Rainbow Media Group.  At the time of the June 18 announcement, the review had found that $6.2 million of expenses for 2003 were accelerated and improperly accrued or expensed in 2002, rather than 2003.  All but $1.7 million of that pre-tax amount was identified and reversed prior to the release of the company's 2002 results.
 
The company also announced on June 18, 2003 that its Audit Committee had retained Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP to conduct an investigation of the matter.  Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP subsequently retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as forensic accountants.
 
In August 2003, the company announced that Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP reported to the audit committee and management of the company that its investigation to that date had identified, in addition to the amounts announced by the company on June 18, 2003, improperly recognized expenses at the original productions units within the AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment business units of the national services division of Rainbow Media Holdings and that pre-tax amounts that should have been expensed in 2003 that were expensed in earlier years equaled approximately $3.4 million.
 
In November 2003, Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP reported that it had substantially completed its detailed review of year-end expenses that may have been improperly accelerated.  With respect to Rainbow Media Holdings, Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP had reported that it had identified, in addition to the amounts reported in June and August 2003, additional improperly accelerated expenses at AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment and at most other business units within Rainbow Media Holdings.  For AMC and WE: Women's Entertainment, the additional pre-tax amounts that should have been expensed in 2003 and later periods that were expensed in earlier years equaled approximately $3.9 million, and for the other Rainbow business units equaled approximately $5.2 million, including $0.7 million in non-consolidated businesses.  The improperly recognized expenses in the Rainbow business units related primarily to sales and marketing, original production and event production activities.  With respect to the non-Rainbow Media Holdings' units of the company, Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP further reported that it had identified approximately $1.7 million in accelerated expenses that should have been recorded in 2003 and later periods, the majority of which consisted of sales and marketing, maintenance and consulting expenses. In late November, the company provided restated results for the first and second quarters of 2003 and 2002 to reflect the impact of the improper expense accelerations identified by the company and the Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP investigation; these restatements were reflected in the company's Form 10-Q filing for the third quarter of 2003.
In February 2004, Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP reported that its investigation of improper expense recognition was nearly complete and that it expects to finalize its investigation prior to the filing of the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.  The investigation has covered all significant operating units within Rainbow Media Holdings, as well as the Telecommunications, Madison Square Garden and Corporate segments and has included a thorough evaluation of the facts (including a review of employee activities) relating to improper expense recognition.  The amounts identified to date are reflected in the table below.  Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP has made recommendations to the Audit Committee with respect to improvements in internal controls.  Certain of these recommendations for both new policies and procedures and enhancement and reinforcement of existing policies and procedures have already been implemented by the company and other recommendations will be implemented by the company over the next few months.
 
The investigations into these matters by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York are continuing.
 
KPMG has advised the company that, upon completion of the Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP investigation and as a result of the remedial actions taken and planned to be taken by the company in response to the improper expense recognition, it expects to provide its audit report on the company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 in the company's annual report on Form 10-K, which includes the required SAS 100 review for the Company's financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2003.
 
The company has also corrected certain other errors primarily with respect to launch and marketing support payments received from programming suppliers, a calculation error made in 1999 regarding minority interests, and the recognition of a gain in 2003 on marketable securities.  It was determined that certain of these items should have been recorded in different periods.  As a result of these errors, operating income and AOCF were each understated by $5.4 million in 2000 and were each overstated by $18.6 million in 2001, by $4.1 million in 2002, and by $7.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2003, respectively.  Income from continuing operations was understated by $22.0 million in 2000, overstated by $11.1 million in 2001, understated by $3.7 million in 2002, and overstated by $10.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
 
The company has reflected corrections for the matters referred to in this section for the 2002 and 2003 periods in this earnings release, and expects to restate its 2000  2002 annual results and results for the quarterly periods in 2002 and 2003 in its Form 10-K and in its amended Forms 10-Q/A's for 2003.
The following table sets forth the effects of the changes referred to in this section on the reported 2002 and 2001 amounts:
 
 
2004 Outlook
The company provides the following full year 2004 guidance.  The 2004 revenue and adjusted operating cash flow guidance is based on the restated full year 2003 results.

Rainbow Developing

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In response to recent SEC guidance, the company will no longer use the term Adjusted EBITDA and will refer to this performance measure as adjusted operating cash flow.  This is a change in terminology only and the company has not changed the way it calculates this measure.
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present "adjusted operating cash flow" as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes adjusted operating cash flow is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted operating cash flow and similar measures with other titles is a common performance measure used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and adjusted operating cash flow measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted operating cash flow should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since adjusted operating cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, please see page 10 of this release.
