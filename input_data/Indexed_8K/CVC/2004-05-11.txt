CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
 
 - 
     
Telecommunications Revenue up 17%, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow up 13%
 - 
     
Rainbow Media Core Networks Revenue up 59%, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow up 62%
 - 
     
Strong Revenue Generating Unit Growth - up 23%
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2004.  Today's results include the effect of the restatement of the company's 2003 results to record the effect of adjustments for amounts improperly recognized in earlier periods.
Bethpage, N.Y., May 10, 2004
 
first quarter net revenues increased 19% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period based on continued strong growth at both the Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media's Core Networks divisions.  Consolidated operating loss totaled $9.6 million, compared to operating income of $31.6 million in the prior year period.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter declined 8% to $267.7 million compared to the year-earlier period.  The operating loss and decline in adjusted operating cash flow were primarily due to costs associated with the launch of VOOM, the company's direct broadcast satellite service, and lower revenue and higher expenses at Madison Square Garden.  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 5 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6 for a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income (loss) and net loss.
Consolidated
 
first quarter 2004 net revenues rose 17% to $740.1 million and operating income increased 80% to $84.8 million, both compared to the prior year period.  AOCF increased 13% to $275.0 million compared to the year-earlier period and in 2004 includes $13.5 million of legal and indemnification expenses and retroactive 2003 programming cost increases related to the agreement with the YES Network.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF reflect continued strong customer demand for the company's high-speed data service, digital video service and Lightpath's business services.
Telecommunications Services
 
(AMC, IFC (The Independent Film Channel), WE: Women's Entertainment and Consolidated Regional Sports) first quarter net revenues increased 59% to $222.4 million.  Operating income increased 47% to $65.9 million and AOCF increased 62% to $87.4 million, each compared to the year-earlier quarter.  The consolidation of Fox Sports Chicago and Bay Area and strong increases in advertising revenue and affiliate fee revenue helped to drive the solid revenue, operating income and adjusted operating cash flow results.
Rainbow Media's Core Networks
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Our strong first quarter performance is an impressive start to an important year for Cablevision as we prepare for the spin off of our satellite, national programming, and theatre assets.  The significant growth in our cable, Lightpath and high-speed businesses reflects our network integrity, market momentum and overall success in executing a digital strategy that is key to Cablevision's future.  Our consumer and business services reported a 17% increase in net revenues, powered by strong demand for iO: Interactive Optimum and Optimum Online, each of which now serve more than 1 million customers.  Cablevision's Optimum Voice service posted strong gains in the first quarter as well, more than doubling its subscriber number to 70,800."
Mr. Dolan continued:  "Rainbow Media's national networks also generated outstanding results for the first quarter.  Driven largely by significant increases in both advertising revenue and affiliate fee revenue, the core networks reported a 59% increase in net revenues."
 
"Cablevision has made significant progress in the implementation of our plans to create two distinct companies.  We announced a proposed corporate structure for the new entity, to be called Rainbow Media Enterprises, that will ensure the continued growth of the satellite, national programming and theatre businesses and we made executive appointments that solidify the management teams of both Cablevision and Rainbow Media.  We are confident that both companies will be well-positioned to seize the opportunities that lay ahead," concluded Mr. Dolan.

AOCF increased 13% to $17.1 million, compared to the prior year period.

Rainbow
Rainbow Media Holdings LLC (Rainbow), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, includes the following businesses:  AMC, IFC, WE, fuse, Mag Rack and five local News 12 Networks operating on Long Island, in New Jersey, Westchester, Connecticut and the Bronx, as well as three local MetroChannels and Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp.  Rainbow, through its 60% ownership interest in Regional Programming Partners (40% owned by Fox Sports), also owns interests in Madison Square Garden, Radio City Entertainment, and
five regional Fox Sports Net channels outside the New York market, and Rainbow owns a 50% interest in the Fox Sports Net national service.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
First quarter 2004 net revenues increased 21% to $126.2 million, operating income increased 16% to $44.3 million and AOCF increased 37% to $60.7 million, each compared to the year-ago period.  This growth was driven by gains in the number of WE and IFC viewing subscribers of 9% and 19%, respectively, resulting in higher affiliate fee revenue.  In addition, the combined AMC and WE advertising revenue increased 63% from the year-earlier period.  Advertising revenue now comprises
28% and 42% of AMC's and WE's total revenue, respectively.
 
Consolidated Regional Sports
Consolidated Regional Sports is comprised of Fox Sports Net Florida, Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area (Chicago and Bay Area were consolidated effective December 12, 2003) and are 60% owned by Rainbow.  First quarter 2004 net revenues rose to $96.2 million from $35.5 million in the prior year period.  Operating income increased to $21.7 million from $6.8 million and AOCF increased to $26.7 million from $9.7 million, both compared to the prior year period.  The strong first quarter results reflect the consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area in December 2003, higher affiliate fee revenue and the timing of certain affiliate settlements.  The combined Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area revenue and AOCF in the first quarter of 2003 was $44.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
 
Developing Programming/Other
Developing Programming/Other consists of Mag Rack, fuse, Rainbow Network Communications, News 12 Networks, MetroChannels, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp., IFC Entertainment and other Rainbow start-up ventures.  First quarter net revenues increased 17% to $50.2 million, and the operating loss for the quarter declined to $24.4 million compared to an operating loss of $33.0 million for the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the quarter totaled $11.2 million compared to an AOCF deficit of $19.3 million for the prior year period.  The higher revenue and lower AOCF deficit were attributable to: an increase in fuse affiliate revenue resulting from an 18% increase in the number of fuse viewing subscribers, which now surpass 30 million; revenue growth at IFC Films resulting from theatrical releases and home video sales; and, lower expense levels at several of the programming services resulting from reductions in certain operating expenses implemented in 2003.
 
Rainbow DBS  VOOM
 
first quarter of 2004, the satellite services division reported net revenues of $1.0 million consisting primarily of sales of satellite receivers and related equipment.  No revenues were recorded for the same period in 2003, as the service had not yet launched.  The operating loss for the first quarter totaled $54.8 million compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million in the year-earlier period. The AOCF deficit for the quarter was $45.0 million compared to $1.7 million in the year-earlier period. The operating loss and AOCF deficit were primarily attributable to costs to develop content for the VOOM high definition channels, marketing and subscriber acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses.
Rainbow DBS launched its VOOM service on October 15, 2003.  As of April 30, 2004, this business had approximately 8,000 activated customers.  For the
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's businesses include MSG Network, Fox Sports Net New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex, and Radio City Music Hall.  Madison Square Garden's first quarter revenue declined 2% to $204.5 million due to fewer live event bookings compared to the prior year period.  The operating loss for the first quarter totaled $34.8 million compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million in the prior year period.  The first quarter AOCF deficit was $19.8 million compared to AOCF of $14.2 million in the prior year period.  The higher operating loss and AOCF deficit were primarily due to higher player compensation related expenses and lower live event revenue.
Theatres
For the three month period ended March 31, 2004 net revenue for Clearview Cinemas totaled $17.5 million, a 6% decline compared to $18.6 million in the year-earlier period.  The operating loss was $2.0 million compared to an operating loss of $0.7 million in the prior year period.  The AOCF deficit for the first quarter was $0.1 million compared to AOCF of $1.1 million in the prior year period.
 
Other 
The Other AOCF deficit totaled $18.6 million for the first quarter compared to an AOCF deficit of $0.4 million in the prior year period.  The first quarter's AOCF deficit was primarily due to certain one-time senior management retirement costs and management bonuses.  The company expects to record an Other AOCF deficit of approximately $40 million for the full year 2004.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes adjusted operating cash flow is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted operating cash flow and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and adjusted operating cash flow measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted operating cash flow should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since adjusted operating cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, please see page 6 of this release.

Restructuring charges (credits)

Collateralized indebtedness is excluded for the purpose of the leverage calculation because it is viewed as a forward sale of the stock of unaffiliated companies and the company's only obligation at maturity is to deliver the stock or its cash equivalent.  Exchangeable preferred stock is excluded from the leverage calculation, as it is exchangeable into either common stock or payable in cash at the company's option.
Madison Square Garden adjusted operating cash flow is based on a trailing 12 months due to its seasonal nature.
