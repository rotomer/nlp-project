Bethpage, N.Y., August 9, 2004
 
Consolidated Results
Consolidated second quarter net revenues increased 25% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period, based on continued strong growth at both Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media's Core Networks.  Consolidated operating income totaled $159.1 million compared to operating income of $26.2 million in the prior year period.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter increased 48% to $435.4 million compared to the year-earlier period.  The increases in operating income and adjusted operating cash flow were driven by revenue increases at Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media's Core Networks as well as $106.1 million of one-time payments and credits at Madison Square Garden, partially offset by costs associated with the launch of VOOM, the company's direct broadcast satellite service.  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 4 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "For the second quarter, Cablevision's video, high-speed data, voice and Lightpath businesses generated excellent results, reporting a 17% increase in net revenues.  Our ongoing success in strengthening our customer relationships is enhanced by our ability to offer our suite of advanced digital services across our entire footprint.  In the second quarter, we led the cable industry in the growth of high-speed data, ending June with a 27% penetration rate.  Cablevision has also achieved, in a short period, a nearly 40% penetration rate for digital video and enjoys enthusiastic consumer response to our digital voice offering, which added 44,200 customers in the second quarter."
 
Mr. Dolan continued:  "Rainbow Media's core networks continued to achieve outstanding results in the second quarter with a net revenue increase of 56%, driven largely by increases in both affiliate fee revenue and advertising revenue."
 
Mr. Dolan continued: "In the second quarter, Cablevision continued to make steady progress on our plan to spin off Rainbow DBS and Rainbow Media's three national networks.  Last week we launched the financing for the new entity and we expect to close that financing shortly."
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
For Telecommunications Services, which includes our cable television consumer services and Lightpath business services, second quarter 2004 net revenues rose 17% to $775.2 million and operating income increased 76% to $109.9 million, both compared to the prior year period.  AOCF increased 21% to $309.3 million compared to the year-earlier period.
 
Cable Television  Consumer Services
Cable Television, comprised of analog and digital video, high-speed data (HSD), voice and R&D/Technology, recorded second quarter net revenues of $730.4 million, up 17% compared to the prior year period.  Operating income increased 82% to $113.0 million and AOCF rose 24% to $292.7 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  Operating income and AOCF include $8.4 million in expense in the 2003 period and a $1.2 million credit in the 2004 period relating to legal and indemnification charges associated with the agreement with the YES Network.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF reflect continued strong consumer demand for the company's digital video, high-speed data, and voice services.
 
Highlights include:
5,421,560 Revenue Generating Units, up 211,580 or 4% from March 2004 and up 924,530 or 21% from the prior year period
 -

 - 
                 
 
Lightpath - Business Services
For the second quarter, Lightpath reported $49.8 million in net revenues, a 9% increase compared to the prior year period.  This growth was primarily attributable to a 47% increase in the number of Business Class Optimum Online customers and a 10% increase in fiber-based transport services, partially offset by a 57% decline in access revenue, primarily due to an FCC mandated reduction in local and long-distance access rates. Lightpath also reported an operating loss of $3.1 million in the second quarter 2004 compared to an operating profit of $0.4 million in the prior year period.  AOCF decreased 19% in the second quarter 2004 to $16.6 million compared to the year-earlier period due to several one-time items.
 
Rainbow Media's Core Networks
Rainbow Media's Core Networks (AMC, IFC (The Independent Film Channel), WE: Women's Entertainment and Consolidated Regional Sports) second quarter net revenues increased 56% to $237.4 million.  For the second quarter of 2004, operating income increased 44% to $70.7 million and AOCF increased 55% to $90.8 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  The consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Bay Area in 2004 and strong increases in advertising and affiliate revenues contributed to the solid revenue, operating income and adjusted operating cash flow results.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
Second quarter 2004 net revenues increased 18% to $129.5 million, operating income increased 11% to $42.9 million and AOCF increased 29% to $58.5 million, each compared to the year-ago period.  Second quarter growth was primarily due to a 48% increase in advertising revenue over the prior year period and higher affiliate revenue from gains in
the number of AMC, WE and IFC viewing subscribers from June 2003 of 3%, 7% and 18%, respectively.
 
Consolidated Regional Sports
Consolidated Regional Sports is comprised of Fox Sports Net Florida, Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area (Chicago and Bay Area were consolidated effective December 12, 2003 and are 60% owned by Rainbow).  Second quarter 2004 net revenues rose to $107.9 million from $42.9 million in the prior year period.  Second quarter 2004 operating income increased to $27.7 million from $10.3 million and AOCF increased to $32.4 million from $13.4 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Pro forma to reflect the consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area in 2003, net revenue would have increased 14% and AOCF would have increased 36%.  The strong second quarter results were attributable to higher advertising revenue and higher affiliate revenue reflecting a 3.9% increase in viewing subscribers from June 2003.
 
Developing Programming/Other
Developing Programming/Other consists of Mag Rack, fuse, Rainbow Network Communications, News 12 Networks, MetroChannels, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp., IFC Entertainment and other Rainbow start-up ventures.  Second quarter net revenues increased 42% to $59.3 million and the operating loss for the quarter declined to $20.0 million compared to an operating loss of $33.3 million for the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the quarter totaled $7.8 million compared to an AOCF deficit of $18.8 million for the prior year period.  The higher revenue and lower AOCF deficit were attributable to: increases in advertising and affiliate revenues at fuse, resulting from a 16% increase from June 2003 in the number of fuse viewing subscribers; revenue growth at IFC Films resulting from theatrical releases, including the co-distribution of "Fahrenheit 9/11", and higher home video sales; and lower expense levels at several of the programming services as a result of reductions in certain operating expenses implemented in 2003.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's businesses include: MSG Network, Fox Sports Net New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.  Madison Square Garden's second quarter revenue increased 25% to $165.8 million.  Operating income for the second quarter totaled $107.7 million compared to an operating loss of $9.3 million in the prior year period.  Second quarter AOCF was $119.9 million compared to AOCF of $9.2 million in the prior year period.  The second quarter operating income and AOCF include the recognition of a $54.0 million payment received from the New York Mets (related to the exercise of a termination option under their rights agreement, effective for the 2006 season) and the related reversal of a $41.8 million purchase accounting liability.  Additionally, the quarter includes a one-time expansion payment from the NBA of $10.3 million, which is recorded in net revenue.  Excluding these one-time items, second quarter net revenues would have grown 17% and AOCF would have grown $4.7 million or 49%, driven by playoff revenue from the Knicks and more event bookings.
 
Rainbow DBS  VOOM
second quarter of 2004, Rainbow DBS reported net revenues of $2.7 million, consisting primarily of subscription revenue, as well as sales and rental income associated with satellite receivers and related equipment.  No revenues were recorded for the same period in 2003, as the service had not yet launched.  The operating loss for the second quarter totaled $81.5 million compared to an operating loss of $3.6 million in the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the second quarter 2004 was $71.8 million compared to $3.5 million in the year-earlier period.  The operating loss and AOCF deficit were primarily attributable to subscriber acquisition costs, content development costs for the VOOM high definition channels, and general and administrative expenses.
As of June 30, 2004, Rainbow DBS had approximately 25,000 activated VOOM customers.  For the
Theatres
For the second quarter, Clearview Cinemas' net revenue totaled $19.4 million, a 13% decline compared to $22.2 million in the prior year period.  The operating loss for the second quarter was $1.8 million compared to operating income of $0.3 million in the prior year period.  The AOCF for the second quarter was $0.2 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year period.
 
Recent Developments
 
In July, the company reached an agreement with Quadrangle Capital Partners LP regarding the redemption of its Series A Preferred Stock.  The company will redeem the Series A Preferred Stock with a cash payment of $150.3 million on August 9, 2004.
 
2004 Outlook
 
The company affirms and revises the previously issued 2004 guidance as outlined in the table below.  Due to the proposed offering of securities by the company's Rainbow National Services subsidiary, guidance for Rainbow Media's National Networks (AMC/IFC/WE) is not addressed.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes adjusted operating cash flow is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted operating cash flow and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and adjusted operating cash flow measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted operating cash flow should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since adjusted operating cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, please see page 6 of this release.
