             Cablevision Systems Corporation continues to make progress in its plan to spin off Rainbow Media Enterprises, which includes Rainbow DBS, the satellite service; Rainbow's three national entertainment networks; and the Clearview Cinemas movie theater chain.
             Cablevision received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service earlier this year to the effect that the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction, and completed the financing plan for Rainbow Media Enterprises in mid-August. Rainbow Media Enterprises filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a third amendment to its Form 10 in early September. Cablevision is currently planning to complete the spin-off during the fourth quarter. Cablevision reiterates that the completion of the spin-off is subject to a number of factors and conditions, including the Form 10 being declared effective by the SEC as well as final approval from the Cablevision board of directors.
