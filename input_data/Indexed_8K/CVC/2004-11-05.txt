ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
     Cablevision Systems Corporation has modified one aspect of its plan to spin off Rainbow Media Enterprises, which includes Rainbow DBS, the satellite service; Rainbow's three national entertainment networks; and the Clearview Cinemas movie theater chain. Cablevision had intended to retain following the distribution redeemable preferred membership interests with an initial liquidation preference of $350 million in the entity that owns Rainbow's AMC and WE national programming services. Cablevision has decided to recontribute that preferred interest to a subsidiary of Rainbow National Services prior to the distribution. This decision was made in light of expected increases in the financing requirements of Rainbow Media Enterprises. The change was reflected in an amendment to Rainbow Media Enterprises' Form 10 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
