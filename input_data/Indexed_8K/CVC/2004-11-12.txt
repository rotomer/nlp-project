FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the third quarter 2004.
Bethpage, N.Y., November 9, 2004
 
Consolidated Results
Consolidated third quarter net revenues increased 20% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period, based on continued strong growth at both Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media's Core Networks.  Consolidated operating income totaled $70.1 million compared to $20.0 million in the prior year period.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter increased 13% to $352.9 million compared to the year-earlier period.  The increases in operating income and adjusted operating cash flow are driven by revenue increases at Telecommunications Services and Rainbow Media's Core Networks, partially offset by Rainbow DBS operating losses.  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 4 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income and net loss.
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Strong consumer demand for Cablevision's services generated impressive results in the third quarter for our video, high-speed data, voice and Lightpath businesses.  Cablevision continues to enjoy the industry's leading penetration rate for high-speed data and now holds the industry's highest digital television penetration rate.  In addition, the company experienced its second consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber growth and a record quarter for our new voice service, which added more than 74,000 customers in the three months.  These results underscore Cablevision's success in marketing our suite of industry-leading services delivered over a state-of-the art network."
 
Mr. Dolan continued: "Rainbow Media continued to achieve excellent results in the third quarter.  Driven largely by increases in advertising revenue and affiliate fee revenue, the core networks reported a 58% increase in net revenues and 39% growth in adjusted operating cash flow.  In addition, in the quarter, Cablevision advanced the plan to spin off Rainbow Media Enterprises, raising  $1.75 billion in financing for the new company and appointing co-CFOs to further solidify its management team."
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
For Telecommunications Services, which includes our Cable Television consumer services and Lightpath business services, third quarter 2004 net revenues rose 14% to $788.3 million and operating income increased 76% to $114.8 million, both compared to the prior year period.  AOCF increased 16% to $317.4 million compared to the year-earlier period.

Operating income and AOCF include $6.1 million in expense in the 2003 period relating to legal and indemnification charges associated with the agreement with the YES Network.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF reflect continued strong growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customer relationships.

Lightpath also reported an operating loss of $0.8 million in the third quarter 2004 compared to an operating loss of $3.8 million in the prior year period.  The revenue increase is primarily attributable to an increase in data revenue from Optimum Online for business customer growth and transmission and internet access services revenue growth.  AOCF was $18.6 million, up 14% from the third quarter of 2003 driven by the revenue increases.  Net revenue for Lighpath includes the impact of Optimum Voice call completion activity, which has no impact on AOCF.
 
Rainbow Media's Core Networks
Rainbow Media's Core Networks' (AMC, The Independent Film Channel ("IFC"), WE: Women's Entertainment and Consolidated Regional Sports) third quarter net revenues increased 58% to $235.9 million over the prior year period.  For the third quarter of 2004, operating income increased 49% to $68.5 million and AOCF increased 39% to $92.6 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  The consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area in 2003 and strong increases in affiliate and advertising revenues contributed to the solid revenue, operating income and adjusted operating cash flow results.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
Third quarter 2004 net revenues increased 22% to $130.2 million, operating income increased 43% to $41.7 million and AOCF increased 26% to $59.4 million, each compared to the year-ago period.  Third quarter growth is primarily due to higher affiliate revenue from gains in the number of AMC, IFC and WE viewing subscribers from September 2003 of 3%, 7% and 19%, respectively and a 45% increase in advertising revenue over the prior year period.  The third quarter 2003 results include $4.3 million of income from the sale of
Adelphia Communications receivables that were previously written off.
  Excluding the sale, operating income and AOCF increased 68% and 39%, respectively.
 
Consolidated Regional Sports
Consolidated Regional Sports is comprised of Fox Sports Net Florida, Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area (Chicago and Bay Area were consolidated effective December 12, 2003 and are 60% owned by Rainbow).  Third quarter 2004 reported net revenues rose to $105.6 million from $42.7 million in the prior year period.  Third quarter 2004 reported operating income increased to $26.8 million from $16.9 million and AOCF increased to $33.2 million from $19.6 million, both compared to the prior year period.
 
Pro forma to reflect the consolidation of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area in 2003, net revenue increased 12% and AOCF increased 7%, due to higher affiliate revenue reflecting a 4% increase in viewing subscribers as well as higher advertising revenue. The third quarter 2003 results include $4.2 million of income from the sale of Adelphia Communications receivables that were previously written off.  Excluding the sale and pro forma to reflect the consolidation of Chicago and Bay Area, AOCF increased 24%.

Third quarter net revenues increased 8% to $51.9 million and the operating loss for the quarter declined to $16.8 million compared to an operating loss of $22.9 million for the year-earlier period.  The AOCF deficit for the quarter totaled $6.5 million compared to an AOCF deficit of $14.1 million for the prior year period.  The lower AOCF deficit is primarily attributable to: revenue growth at IFC Films relating to the co-distribution of , higher revenue recorded at fuse due to a 16% increase in viewing subscribers, and higher advertising sales and lower expense levels at several of the programming services.

Madison Square Garden

The AOCF deficit for the third quarter 2004 was $60.4 million compared to $29.4 million in the year-earlier period.

Adjusted to give effect to retroactive affiliate settlements.
                            
 
2004 guidance for revenue and adjusted operating cash flow treats the acquisition of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area as though both were consolidated on January 1, 2003.
Note:
      
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  The company believes adjusted operating cash flow is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  Adjusted operating cash flow and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and adjusted operating cash flow measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  Adjusted operating cash flow should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since adjusted operating cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, please see page 6 of this release.
