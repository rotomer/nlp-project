ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On March 3, 2005 and March 4, 2005, Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") entered into amendments to its employment arrangements with James L. Dolan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Hank J. Ratner, the Company's Vice Chairman, Michael P. Huseby, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Thomas M. Rutledge, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, and certain other officers of the Company (the "Affected Officers") to amend those employment arrangements to comply with the new requirements imposed on deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The employment arrangements with the Affected Officers have been amended to provide that if amounts owed to them upon termination of their employment are subject to the new requirements, those payments and benefits will be delayed by up to six months in order to prevent imposition of an additional tax. These amounts would be paid to a trust for their benefit and then distributed to them with earnings six months later. The amendments also clarify that when they terminate employment, their equity-based awards will not be extended beyond their regularly scheduled term (as if they had not been terminated). -2-
