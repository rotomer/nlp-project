ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company" or "Cablevision") announced on March 8, 2005, that it had entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan, the Chairman of the Company, and Thomas C. Dolan, a director of the Company, pursuant to which the parties will work cooperatively to finalize the separation of the Company's Rainbow DBS subsidiary from the Company. Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the Company cash or shares of the Company's common stock in advance of the Company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, the Company will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. On March 9, 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $10 million with the Company. The agreement will allow Rainbow DBS to remain in operation and to continue to provide its VOOM service to its subscribers while Charles and Thomas Dolan seek to arrange an alternate transaction that would avoid shutdown of Rainbow DBS. The agreement will terminate on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan will have the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to pay expenses or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately.
