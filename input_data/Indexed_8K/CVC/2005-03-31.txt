Exhibit 99.1
The Board of Directors
Rainbow National Services LLC:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rainbow National Services LLC as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, member's equity (deficiency) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004.  In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule.  These consolidated financial statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Rainbow National Services LLC has operated as an integral part of Cablevision.  As described in Notes 1 and 9, these consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations.  The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Rainbow National Services LLC could differ from those that might have resulted had Rainbow National Services LLC been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rainbow National Services LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
As discussed in Note 2, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 and the statements of member's equity (deficiency) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 have been restated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE 1.
                                                   
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND LIQUIDITY
 
Nature of Operations
 
In July 2004, Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") formed Rainbow National Services LLC (the "Company").  The Company is a holding company with no independent operations.  Its subsidiaries include entities that principally own certain nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment services operated as integral parts of Cablevision, including AMC, WE: Women's Entertainment ("WE") and The Independent Film Channel ("IFC").  The Company's consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations (see Note 9).  The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company could differ from those that might have resulted had the Company been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
 
The common equity membership interests of American Movies Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") and its wholly owned subsidiaries and The Independent Film Channel LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries were contributed to the Company.  For accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests whereby the assets and liabilities were transferred at historical cost.  Accordingly, the financial statements reflect the operations of the Company as if the transaction occurred on January 1, 2002.
 
Cablevision had previously announced its intention to distribute (hereinafter referred to as the "distribution") the businesses and assets included in the Company as well as other businesses and assets of Cablevision to Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. ("RME").  RME is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC Holdings, Inc., itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision. In connection with the anticipated distribution, Cablevision had contributed certain businesses and assets to RME through a series of intercorporate transactions.  RME announced it would own these businesses and assets and become a public company on the date of the distribution.  As part of the series of intercorporate transactions, RME had contributed the common equity membership interests owned by the entities included in these consolidated financial statements to the Company.
 
In December 2004, Cablevision announced that the Board of Directors had decided to suspend pursuing the distribution.  See Note 17.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
In August 2004, Rainbow National Services LLC entered into a $950,000 senior secured credit facility ($350,000 of which is a revolving credit facility maturing September 30, 2011 and $600,000 of which is a term loan facility maturing March 31, 2012) ("Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility is secured by the assets and stock of AMC, WE and IFC and guaranteed by AMC, WE and IFC, and Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, the Company's direct parent. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios (as
defined in the credit facility) as well as restrictions on distributions, additional indebtedness, and liens. The maximum total leverage ratio per the credit facility is 6.75 times the cash flow (as defined) of AMC, IFC and WE through 2006. The revolving credit facility requires commitment reductions beginning December 31, 2009 through September 30, 2011. The term loan requires amortization of 0.25% of the original outstanding balance per quarter beginning June 30, 2005 through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% of the original outstanding balance for each quarter thereafter through its maturity date. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin based upon the leverage ratio. Amounts under the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2004. The interest rate under the term loan was 5.19% on December 31, 2004.
 
On the date of issuance of the senior and senior subordinated notes, AMC LLC issued 3,500,000 shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a capital distribution.  No dividends were recorded through December 31, 2004.
 
On November 5, 2004, the Board of Directors of Cablevision authorized Cablevision to modify the terms of the distribution to eliminate the retained redeemable preferred membership interest in AMC LLC.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the elimination will be to reduce debt by $350,000 and increase member's equity (deficiency) by the same amount in 2005.
 
At December 31, 2004, long-term assets include $155,567 of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC.  In March 2005, this amount was converted to equity and recorded as a capital distribution.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue as programming services are provided to multiple system operators or satellite providers.  Advertising revenue is recognized as commercials are telecast.  In some situations, our programming businesses guarantee certain viewer ratings for their programming.  For these types of transactions, a portion of such revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized by providing additional advertising time.
Technical and Operating Expense
 
Costs of revenue related to sales of programming services including, but not limited to, license fees and production costs, are classified as "technical and operating" expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.
 
Advertising Expenses
 
Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred.  Advertising costs were $53,625, $51,890 and $41,130 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating general factors such as length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and the economic and competitive environment.
 
Feature Film Inventory
 
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun.  Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight-line basis over the respective license periods.  Amounts payable subsequent to December 31, 2004 related to feature film rights telecast are as follows:
 
 
See Note 4 for a discussion of the Company's review of the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory and impairment charges recorded in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
 
In July 2003, AMC, WE, IFC and Rainbow Media Holdings LLC (formerly Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc.), as licensees, entered into an agreement with a film studio for feature film telecast rights.  Each licensee recorded its allocated share of the future film telecast rights and all of the payment obligations for which they are jointly and severally liable for payments of $84,000 of which approximately $75,000 remained unpaid at December 31, 2004 and is included in the amounts above.  Film assets and liabilities of approximately $15,000 and $17,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are allocated outside of the Company, of which approximately $700 and $1,000 was paid during 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Such amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Member's Equity (Deficiency) as capital distributions and capital contributions, respectively.
Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets
 
Property and equipment are carried at cost.  Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments.  Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported with depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations.
 
Intangible assets established in connection with acquisitions consist of affiliation agreements, advertiser relationships, and excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired.  Affiliation agreements represent the value assigned to agreements with multiple system operators to carry programming services, and are amortized over a 10 year period on the straight-line basis.  Advertiser relationships represent the value assigned to contracts with advertisers and are amortized over a 7 to 10 year period on the straight-line basis.  Excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") in purchase business combinations are not amortized in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002.
 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  Statement No. 142 requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two-step process.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in a business combination.
 
Deferred Carriage Fees
 
Deferred carriage fees represent amounts paid or payable to multiple system operators to guarantee carriage of certain of the Company's programming services and are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related guarantee (1 to 11 years).
Deferred Financing Costs
 
Costs incurred to obtain debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are provided based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and permits the recognition of deferred tax assets, subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability.  The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships.
 
The Company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Cablevision for the years presented herein.  The income tax expense presented is based upon the taxable income of the Company on a separate return basis.  Since there was no tax sharing agreement in place between the Company and Cablevision, current tax liabilities that the consolidated companies did not pay directly have been reflected as deemed contributions to the Company's capital.  Such contributions amounted to $51,835, $46,286 and $36,064 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
 
Reclassifications
 
Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2003 and 2002 financial statements to conform to the 2004 presentation.
 
Cash Flows
 
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company's non-cash investing and financing activities and other supplemental data were as follows:
 
During 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash equity distribution of approximately $1,400 to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC to reflect the resolution of certain film rights agreements associated with Rainbow Media Holdings LLC's sale of an affiliate in 2002.
 
Concentrations and Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash is invested in bank time deposits offered by financial institutions that have received the highest ratings awarded by S&P and Moody's.  The Company had three customers that accounted for approximately 38% and 39% of the Company's net trade receivable balances at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers accounted for approximately 41%, 46% and 45% of the Company's consolidated net revenue in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Commitments and Contingencies
 
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Statement No. 153 addresses the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.  Statement No. 153 eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  Previously, Opinion 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished.  The Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  The provisions of Statement No. 153 will be adopted for all nonmonetary exchanges initiated after July 1, 2005 and therefore had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004.
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (Statement No. 123R). Statement No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. Statement No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Statement No. 123R is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Cablevision will be required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 123R beginning with its fiscal quarter commencing on July 1, 2005, and therefore the Statement had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cablevision has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect that the adoption will have on its financial position or results of operations.
 
NOTE 2.                RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The Company recorded push down accounting adjustments as a result of Cablevision's purchase accounting recorded for the 2002 and 2001 NBC transactions and the 2003 MGM transaction (as described in Note 3).  The Company has restated its previously reported balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 and the statements of member's equity (deficiency) and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to reflect adjustments to its pushdown accounting entries related to the determination of deferred taxes and associated goodwill for the NBC transactions and the MGM transaction and to conform the accounting for deferred taxes on partnership investments to Cablevision's accounting policy to provide deferred taxes on the outside basis difference in such investments.
 
The following table sets forth the impact of the restatement showing previously reported amounts and restated amounts on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003:
 
The adjustments resulted in reclassifications to current and deferred income tax expense in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.  For the year ended December 31, 2003, current tax expense increased by $9,170 and the deferred tax benefit increased by $9,170.  For the year ended December 31, 2002 current tax expense decreased by $7,614 and the deferred tax benefit decreased by $7,614.  In addition, the restatement adjustments resulted in a decrease to member's equity as of January 1, 2002 of $3,147, a net decrease to capital contributions in 2002 of $57,106 and an increase to capital contributions in 2003 of $10,730. There was no impact on net income or cash flows from operating activities in either 2003 or 2002.  In addition, this restatement had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company's parent, Cablevision as these items related solely to the application of certain pushdown accounting adjustments affecting the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
 
NOTE 3.                TRANSACTIONS
 
In July 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings repurchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'s ("MGM") 20% interest in each of AMC LLC and The Independent Film Channel LLC for $500,000 and entered into a film rights agreement relating to the MGM film library.  The acquisition of this minority interest was accounted for as a purchase.  The excess of the purchase price over the net book value of the assets acquired of approximately $415,661, has been pushed down to the respective subsidiaries as of the purchase date and was allocated to the specific assets acquired as follows:
 
 
In connection with Cablevision's acquisition of NBC's interest in Rainbow Media Holdings in 2002 and 2001, the excess of the purchase price over the net book value of assets acquired has been pushed down to the respective subsidiaries as of the purchase date and was allocated to the specific assets acquired based upon an independent appraisal.  Approximately $142,531 of the excess purchase price was attributed to the Company and was allocated to the specific assets acquired and deferred taxes as follows:
 
 
Of these amounts, $102,361 was recorded in 2002 which, when reduced by $44,484 of deferred tax liabilities, resulted in a net pushdown of additional basis in the Company's consolidated statement of member's equity (deficiency) of $57,877.
 
NOTE 4.                IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
 
The Company periodically reviews the programming usefulness of feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service.  If it is determined that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, a write-off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films is recorded.
 
As part of its periodic review of expected programming usefulness, the Company recorded impairment losses of $297, $17,910, and $1,938 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  Such amounts represented the write-off of the carrying value of certain film and programming contracts and are included in technical and operating expense.
 
NOTE 5.                PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
Property and equipment consist of the following assets which are depreciated or amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives shown below:
 
 
Depreciation and amortization expense relating to property and equipment amounted to $7,487, $7,716 and $5,583, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.
NOTE 6.                INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
The following table summarizes information relating to the Company's acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003:
 
 
* As restated (see Note 2)
 
Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $64,216, $48,474 and $22,644, respectively.
 
 
The changes in the carrying amount of excess costs over the fair value of net assets acquired for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:
 
 
NOTE 7.                DEBT
 
In August 2004, the Company entered into debt financing arrangements totaling approximately $1,750,000 consisting of a $950,000 senior secured credit facility comprised of a $600,000 term loan and $350,000 undrawn revolving credit facility, and senior and senior subordinated notes totaling approximately $800,000.  Proceeds from the credit facility and the senior and senior subordinated notes amounted to approximately $1,366,300 of which $1,366,150 was distributed to Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC and recorded as a capital distribution.
The Company's senior secured credit facility is secured by the assets and stock of AMC, IFC and WE and is guaranteed by AMC, WE, IFC and Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, the Company's direct parent.  The term loan requires quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% beginning June 30, 2005 through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% for each quarter ending June 30, 2011 through March 31, 2012, its maturity date. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin based upon the leverage ratio.  Amounts under the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%.  The interest rate under the term loan was 5.19% at December 31, 2004.  Outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility were $600,000 as of December 31, 2004, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $350,000.  Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined, based on the consolidated cash flows of AMC, WE and IFC), through December 31, 2006 with reductions thereafter, (ii) a maximum senior leverage of 5.00 times cash flow, reducing to 4.75 times on October 1, 2005 with further reductions thereafter, and (iii) minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense and cash flow to debt service (all as defined in the credit agreement).  Additional covenants include restrictions on distributions, additional indebtedness, and liens.  Permitted distributions include up to $150,000 annually, with a cumulative limit of $600,000 to fund Rainbow DBS Holdings, Inc. and Rainbow HD Holdings LLC (collectively "Rainbow DBS"); up to $50,000 annually, with a cumulative limit of $200,000, for other general purposes; and subject to maintaining a maximum ratio of total debt to cash flow of 5.0 times, distributions of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings.
 
The Company is also obligated to pay fees of 0.5% per annum on the unused loan commitment which is recorded as interest expense.
 
The Company's notes offerings consisted of $300,000 face amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012 and $500,000 face amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014.  Net proceeds from these offerings totaled approximately $775,900, net of financing costs.  These issuances are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries.  Principal covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 7.0 times, reducing to 6.0 times after January 1, 2009, limitations on distributions, and limitations on the ability to incur liens (as per the term of the senior note indenture).
 
The senior notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of face value at any time on or after September 1, 2008, 102.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, and 100% of face value on or after 2010.  The senior subordinated notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 105.188% of face value at any time on or after September 1, 2009, 103.458% of face value on or after September 1, 2010, 101.729% of face value on or after September 1, 2011, and 100% of the aggregate principal amount face value on or after in each case together with accrued interest to the redemption date.
 
The Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2004.
Summary of Five-Year Debt Maturities
 
Total amounts payable by the Company under its various debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2004 (excluding capital leases), during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004 are as follows:
 
 
The Company has no independent assets or operations of its own, the guarantees under the senior and senior subordinated notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor.  There are no restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of the subsidiary guarantors to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
 
On the date of issuance of the senior and senior subordinated notes, AMC LLC issued 3,500,000 shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution.  No dividends were recorded through December 31, 2004.
 
On November 5, 2004, the Board of Directors of Cablevision authorized Cablevision to modify the terms of the distribution to eliminate the retained redeemable preferred membership interest in AMC LLC.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the elimination will be to reduce debt by $350,000 and increase member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
 
NOTE 8.                LEASES

NOTE 9.                AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS
 
Allocations
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the application of certain allocation policies of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings, which are summarized below.  Management believes that these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis.  However, it is not practicable to determine whether the allocated amounts represent amounts that might have been incurred on a stand-alone basis, as there are no company-specific or comparable industry benchmarks with which to make such estimates.  Explanations of the composition and the amounts of the more significant allocations are described below.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Costs
 
General and administrative costs, including costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions (such as human resources, legal, finance, tax, audit, treasury, strategic planning, information technology, creative and production services, etc.) have
been allocated by Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings generally based upon specific usage measured by proportionate headcount or square footage.  In addition, certain allocations are based on relative revenues or expenses of the Company in relation to those of consolidated Cablevision or consolidated Rainbow Media Holdings.  The remaining overhead, principally salaries of corporate executives, is allocated based on management's estimate of the level of effort expended on each business unit based on historical trends.  Such costs allocated to the Company amounted to $24,990, $20,940 and $18,368 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Health and Welfare Plans
 
Employees of the Company participate in health and welfare plans sponsored by Cablevision.  Health and welfare benefit costs have generally been allocated by Cablevision based upon the proportionate number of participants in the plans.  Such costs amounted to $1,660, $1,934, and $1,454 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Related-Party Transactions
 
As described below, the Company provides services to and receives services from affiliates of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings.  As many of these transactions are conducted between subsidiaries under common control of Cablevision, amounts charged for these services may not represent amounts that might have been incurred if the transactions were based upon arm's length negotiations.
 
The Company distributes programming to the pay television industry under contracts called affiliation agreements.  Revenues earned under affiliation agreements with companies owned by or affiliated with Cablevision for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $10,373, $9,260, and $9,516, respectively.
 
Rainbow Media Holdings pays the Company for advertising revenue earned in connection with an agreement between Rainbow Media Holdings and a third party entered into during 2000.  Such revenues were $170, $170, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  In addition, the Company earned $121, $0, and $54 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively for advertising revenue earned from subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings.  The Company incurred $661, $442, and $374 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively for advertising expenses charged by subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings.
 
The Company provided affiliate sales support functions which included primarily salaries, facilities, and general and administrative costs, to affiliates of Rainbow Media Holdings during 2004 and 2003.  These costs were recorded as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative costs and amounted to $4,914 and $2,075 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  There were no such amounts in 2002.
The Company has the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings in addition to subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings having the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and third parties.  Net amounts charged (credited) to technical and operating expense of the Company under these arrangements amounted to $2,564, $1,770, and $(2,798) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
 
Cablevision and the Company may enter into agreements with third party service providers in which the amounts paid by Cablevision or the Company may differ from the amounts that Cablevision or the Company would otherwise pay if such arrangements were on an arm's-length basis.  These arrangements are in return for the service provider's or its affiliate's agreement to make payments or provide services to Cablevision or the Company on a basis more or less favorable than either Cablevision or the Company would otherwise obtain.  Where the Company has received the benefits of Cablevision's negotiations in the form of increased affiliation payments or discounted license fees, Cablevision charges the Company the amount of the benefit.  In one such agreement, Cablevision entered into an affiliation agreement with a provider that resulted in higher rates per subscriber charged to Cablevision than those under a previous agreement.  As part of the negotiations, the service provider agreed to amend the existing film license agreement with the Company with both reduced license fees and a revised list of film titles licensed.  Since the Company received the benefit of Cablevision's negotiations in the form of discounted license fees, Cablevision charged the Company $10,000, which was treated as a cost to acquire the rights to the revised list of film titles and was classified as feature film inventory.  Amortization of this charge over the remaining license period has been reflected as increased film licensing costs of $1,622 in each of 2003 and 2002, respectively, which has been included in technical and operating expenses.  In 2004 no such amortization amount was recorded as the remaining net book value of this film cost in the amount of $2,432 at December 31, 2003 was written off in connection with the impairment charge recorded during 2003 (see Note 4).
 
Rainbow Network Communications ("RNC"), an affiliate of the Company, provides certain transmission and production services to the Company.  The Company was charged approximately $9,069, $8,943, and $8,434 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for these services.  The Company has entered into agreements that allow RNC to continue providing these services through 2021.  Future cash payments required under these agreements amount to $9,264 in 2005, $9,577 in 2006, $9,906 in 2007, $10,251 in 2008, $10,615 in 2009 and $145,048 thereafter.
 
Interest income recorded by subsidiaries of the Company in connection with loan agreements entered into during 2001 and 2002 amounted to $646 and $980 in 2003 and 2002.  During 2003, all outstanding affiliate loan balances were repaid.
 
Under contractual agreements, Cablevision provides certain management services to the Company.  These agreements provide for payment, in addition to expense reimbursement, of an aggregate fee of 3.5% of AMC and WE's gross revenues, as defined in the management agreement.  The agreements are automatically renewable every five years at the option of
Cablevision.  Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company was charged management fees of $15,485, $13,114, and $10,793, in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
 
Cablevision allocates to the Company its proportionate share of expenses or benefits related to Cablevision's employee stock plan and Cablevision's long-term incentive plan.  For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a net expense (benefit) of approximately $2,447, $4,301, and $(1,585), respectively, for its proportionate share of the Cablevision stock plan expense (benefit) and recorded an expense of $1,527, $1,166, and $3,218, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to Cablevision's long-term incentive plan.  Such amounts are recorded as administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  Liabilities related to the grants under the Cablevision Employee Stock Plan are funded by Rainbow Media Holdings and are reflected as either capital contributions from or distributions to Rainbow Media Holdings in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  The long-term incentive plans are funded by the Company and liabilities of $7,498 and $9,455, related to these plans are included in Accrued employee related costs and Other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Equity Contributions (Distributions)
 
In 2002, the Company recorded $57,877 reflecting the push down of additional Cablevision basis in the Company in connection with Cablevision's acquisition of NBC's interest in Rainbow Media Holdings.  In connection with Rainbow Media Holdings' sale of an affiliate in 2002, approximately $39,000 of net assets including cash of approximately $20,000, were contributed to the Company.
 
In 2003, in connection with Rainbow Media Holdings' repurchase of MGM's 20% interest in AMC, WE and IFC, the Company recorded approximately $415,661 reflecting the push down of Rainbow Media Holdings additional basis in the Company.  In March 2003, AMC, IFC and WE entered into a $75,000 credit facility consisting of a $40,000 revolver and a $35,000 term loan, secured by all of the assets of the borrowers.  In December 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings entered into an $823,000 credit facility consisting of a $200,000 revolving credit facility and a $623,000 term loan, maturing on March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively.  This facility amended and combined the previously existing Rainbow Media Holdings' $300,000 credit facility and the AMC, IFC and WE $75,000 credit facility entered into in March 2003.  As a result, Rainbow Media Holdings assumed the obligation of the AMC, IFC and WE term loan which was recorded as an equity contribution in the amount of approximately $35,000.  Additionally, in 2003, $32,000 of a note receivable from Rainbow Media Holdings was forgiven and recorded as a capital distribution.
 
In August 2004, AMC LLC issued 3,500,000 shares of redeemable preferred membership interests to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a capital distribution (see Note 7).
 
NOTE 10.              BENEFIT PLANS
 
Cablevision sponsors a cash balance pension plan and a 401(k) savings plan in which certain employees of the Company participate.  In connection with the cash balance plan, the Company is charged by Cablevision for credits made into an account established for each participant.  Such credits are based upon a percentage of eligible base pay and a market-based rate of return.  The Company also makes matching contributions for a portion of employee voluntary contributions to the 401(k) savings plan.  Total expense related to these plans was approximately $851, $1,208, and $671 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.  The Company does not provide postretirement benefits for any of its employees.
NOTE 11.              INCOME TAXES
 
The income tax provision is determined on a stand-alone basis as if the Company filed separate consolidated income tax returns for the years presented herein.
 
Income tax expense of the Company consists of the following components:
 
 
The income tax expense of the Company differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the effect of the following items:
 
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:
 
NOTE 12.              COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Commitments and contingent obligations not reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 increased approximately $8,000 to approximately $225,000 as compared to approximately $216,700 outstanding at December 31, 2003.  The increase resulted primarily from the addition of future film obligations of approximately $26,000, offset by the recording of a liability for carriage commitments with a multiple system operator amounting to approximately $10,000 and the payment of transmission service commitments of approximately $9,000.
 
Commitments as of December 31, 2004 and for the ensuing calendar years are $13,497 in 2005, $12,878 in 2006, $12,922 in 2007, $15,106 in 2008, $17,243 in 2009 and $153,089 thereafter.   Commitments consist primarily of marketing commitments to various multiple system operators, commitments for future film obligations, and commitments for technical and support services with Rainbow Network Communications, a subsidiary of RME.
 
NOTE 13.              DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Trade Accounts Receivable, Accounts Receivable-Affiliates, Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities and Accounts Payable-Affiliates
 
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
 
Bank Debt, Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes and Preferred Membership Interests
 
The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are summarized as follows:
 
 
The fair value of each of the Company's senior debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the bank debt and the preferred membership interests is estimated to approximate the carrying amount of such interests.
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
NOTE 14.              LEGAL MATTERS
 
The Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving substantial amounts.  Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe that the resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.
 
Time Warner Litigation
 
On November 14, 2003, American Movie Classics Company (predecessor to American Movie Classics Company LLC) filed an action against Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. (Time Warner) in New York State Supreme Court for declaratory relief and damages caused by Time Warner's anticipatory repudiation of its cable television affiliation agreement with American Movie Classics Company.  American Movie Classics Company filed that action as a result of Time Warner's notice purporting to terminate the contract based upon their allegation that American Movie Classics Company had changed its programming.  The Company believes the notice was improper.  American Movie Classics Company is seeking a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to full performance of the agreement, and, at its option, is entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages.  Time Warner filed an answer and counterclaims in December 2003 seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment as to its right to terminate the affiliation agreement, an injunction requiring American Movie Classics Company to deliver a classic films channel and damages for an alleged breach of contract.  Trial is currently scheduled for May 2005.  The Company believes that Time Warner's counterclaims are without merit and is contesting them vigorously.   If the Company does not prevail in the litigation, this business will be materially and adversely affected.
 
Broadcast Music, Inc. and the American Society of Composers Matter
 
Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP"), organizations which license the performance of musical compositions of respective members, allege that certain of the Company's subsidiaries require a license to exhibit musical compositions in their respective catalogs. BMI and ASCAP have each agreed to interim fees based on revenues covering certain periods for certain subsidiaries. These matters have been submitted to a Federal Rate Court, and are subject to retroactive adjustment either at such time as a final decision is made by the Court or a final agreement is reached by the parties.
 
Accounting Related Investigations
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York continue to conduct investigations into matters related to the improper expense recognition previously reported by Cablevision. In July 2004, in connection with Cablevision's response to the comments of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Cablevision's filings under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Cablevision provided information with respect to certain of its previous restatement adjustments relating to the timing of recognition of launch support, marketing and other payments under affiliation agreements. The staff of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Cablevision to ask for additional information on these launch support, marketing and other payments.
 
NOTE 15.              SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments: AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE) and IFC.  These reportable segments are strategic business units that are managed separately.  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment adjusted operating cash flow (defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and stock plan income or expense).  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.  Information as to the operations of the Company's business segments is set forth below.
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of reportable segment amounts to the Company's combined balances is as follows
:
 
Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company's reportable segments are attributed to or located in the United States.

The following is a summary of selected quarterly financial data of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:
 
 
NOTE 17.              SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
In December 2004, Cablevision announced its Board of Directors had decided to suspend pursuing the planned spin-off of Rainbow Media Enterprises in its then proposed form and would instead pursue strategic alternatives for its Rainbow DBS business. In January 2005, Cablevision's Board of Directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of Rainbow DBS and the shutdown of its business. On January 20, 2005, Rainbow DBS entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of EchoStar Communications Corp. for $200,000 in cash. This transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. In February 2005, Cablevision signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision
Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from Cablevision the business, assets and liabilities of Cablevision's Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in Cablevision's definitive agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Cablevision and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached.
 
Following the expiration of the letter of intent, Cablevision began shutting down the Rainbow DBS operations. In March 2005, Cablevision entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan ("March 2005 Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from Cablevision. Cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at Rainbow DBS during the term of the March 2005 Agreement. Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to Cablevision cash or shares of Cablevision's common stock in advance of Cablevision making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, Cablevision will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. In March 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $15,000 with Cablevision in accordance with the March 2005 Agreement.
 
The March 2005 Agreement between Cablevision and Charles and Thomas Dolan terminates on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. In the event of a shutdown, Cablevision anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early termination of various contracts, other contractual obligations, employee termination benefits and other costs. In the event of a shutdown, assuming the consummation of the Rainbow 1 sale to Echostar, Cablevision does not expect any material impact to its liquidity position.
 
On March 28, 2005, VOOM HD, LLC and the Association of Consumers to Preserve and Promote DBS Competition filed a Joint Petition to deny the applications for approval of the EchoStar transaction pending at the Federal Communications Commission.
 
 
During 2002, the Company recorded bad debt expense of approximately $6,600 in connection with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications in June 2002.  In connection with the sale of an affiliate in 2002, Rainbow Media Holdings transferred to the Company approximately $2,200 of receivables from Adelphia Communications that had been previously reserved.  During 2003, the Company wrote off approximately $8,700 of trade receivables from Adelphia Communications and the related allowance following the sale of such receivables to a third party for $4,300 which was recorded in other operating income.  During 2004, the Company recovered approximately $1,800 of trade receivables from a multiple system operator that had previously been reserved.

Overview
 
We provide television programming to cable television and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators throughout the United States.  We own three nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment programming networks:  AMC; WE: Women's Entertainment, or WE; and The Independent Film Channel, or IFC.
general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the effectiveness of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers.
Our future performance depends on
 
We earn revenues in two principal ways.  First, we distribute programming to operators of cable television systems and DBS operators under multi-year contracts called affiliation agreements. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks but are generally based upon the number of that affiliate's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as "viewing subscribers." The second principal source of revenues is from advertising.  Under our agreements with cable and satellite operators we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programs.  Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees.  This is because most of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts.  Also, our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services.
 
We seek to grow our revenues by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming.  We refer to this as our "penetration."  AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than WE and IFC.  WE and IFC, although carried on many of the larger distributors, have superior growth opportunities resulting from their current carriage levels with cable television operators.  IFC is currently carried primarily on digital tiers while WE is carried on either analog expanded basic or digital tiers.  Therefore, WE and IFC penetration rates may increase if operators are successful in converting their analog subscribers to digital tiers of service.  Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements.  We may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for these additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee expenses, discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.  We may seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing and by airing an increased number of minutes of national advertising, but ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues is directly related to the penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services.
 
Our principal goals are to increase our affiliation and advertising revenues through increasing penetration of our services.  To do this we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality programming that is desirable to our viewing audience.  Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television and DBS operators.  This increased concentration enhances the power of those distributors and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration.  In addition, this concentration gives those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements.  Moreover, as a result of this concentration the impact from a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would have a significant adverse impact on our business.
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments:  AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE) and IFC.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include:
 
Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets:
 
Our long-lived assets at December 31, 2004 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") of approximately $22.4 million, approximately $443.3 million of other intangible assets, approximately $13.1 million of property and equipment and approximately $344.8 million of long-term feature film inventory.  Such assets accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated total assets.
 
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2002, and then on a periodic basis thereafter. Statement 142 requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
 
The impairment test for other long-lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.
 
such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any
comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. These valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers, access to film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell-out rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to our long-lived assets.
 
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Company's reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite-lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the Company's reporting units.
 
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight-line basis over the respective license periods. We periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, we would record a write-off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films.   For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we recorded an impairment loss of $0.3 million, $17.9 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, included in technical and operating expense, representing the impairment of certain film contracts.
 
Useful Lives of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
 
The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the July 2003 repurchase of MGM's 20% interest in each of AMC, WE and IFC and the repurchase of NBC's interests in Rainbow Media Holdings LLC in various transactions in 2001 and 2002. The Company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be 10 years for affiliation agreements and 7 to 10 years for advertiser relationships. At December 31, 2004, the carrying values, net of accumulated amortization, were $367.6 million for affiliation agreements and $73.9 million for advertiser relationships.
 
The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements finite-lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and the related customer relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant
adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 8 to10 years is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible.
 
There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals.
 
If an affiliate were to cease carrying a service, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under "Impairment Of Long-Lived And Indefinite-Lived Assets" for the asset group containing that intangible. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2004 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization in the year ending December 31, 2005 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $6.8 million.
 
Certain Transactions
 
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
In August 2004, Rainbow National Services LLC ("RNS"), entered into a $950.0 million senior secured credit facility ($350.0 million of which is a revolving credit facility and $600.0 million of which is a term loan facility) and issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due 2012 and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014.
 
In July 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings repurchased MGM's 20% interest in each of AMC, WE and IFC for $500.0 million.
 
During 2002 and 2001, Cablevision acquired NBC's interest in Rainbow Media Holdings.  The excess of the purchase price over the net book value of assets acquired had been pushed down to the respective subsidiaries of Cablevision as of the purchase date and was allocated to the specific assets acquired based upon their estimated fair value.  Approximately $142.5 million of the excess purchase price, was attributed to the Company.  Of these amounts, $102.4 million was recorded in 2002, which when reduced by $44.5 million of deferred tax liabilities, resulted in a net pushdown of additional basis in the Company's consolidated statement of member's equity (deficiency) of $57.9 million.
Accounting Investigation
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York continue to conduct investigations into matters related to the improper expense recognition previously reported by Cablevision. In July 2004, in connection with Cablevision's response to the comments of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Cablevision's filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Cablevision provided information with respect to certain of its previous restatement adjustments relating to the timing of recognition of launch support, marketing and other payments under affiliation agreements. The staff of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted Cablevision to ask for additional information on these launch support, marketing and other payments.
 
Cautionary Note Concerning Historical Financial Statements
 
Investors should be aware that we are highly leveraged as a result of the financing transactions which took place in August 2004.  As a result, we will incur significant interest charges.  These interest charges will be significantly in excess of the interest expense reflected in our historical financial statements.  In addition, our financial information does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial position would have been if we had operated as a separate entity during the periods presented.
 
Results of Operations
 
The following table sets forth on a historical basis certain items related to operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA
 
 
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2003
 
for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $85.3 million (19%) as compared to revenues for the prior year.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
 
The increase in net revenue from advertising for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Netwoks and IFC of $45.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively.  The increase in net revenue from programming networks subscribers and rate increases for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Networks and IFC of $20.8 million and  $16.5 million, respectively.
 
Offsetting the potentially negative effects on negotiated rates for our programming services that may result from the consolidation of cable television operators and the limit on increases in the subscriber base for our substantially fully penetrated AMC programming service, the Company expects increased revenues from increased distribution of the WE and IFC programming services, especially on the digital tiers of cable programming services on cable television
systems as digital capacity continues to become available; and increased advertising revenues as cable networks, including niche programming networks, attract a greater share of advertising spending.   Changes in the viewership ratings of our AMC and WE programming services will also significantly affect future advertising revenues.
 
include primarily costs to license programming including feature films, and programming and production costs.
Technical and operating expenses
 
Technical and operating expenses for 2004 increased $0.3 million (less than 1%) compared to 2003.  Excluding the impact of impairment losses amounting to $0.3 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, technical and operating expenses for 2004 increased $17.9 million (14%) compared to 2003. The increase in technical and operating expense, excluding the impact of impairment losses, is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $11.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 5% in 2004 compared to 2003.  Excluding the impact of impairment losses, technical and operating expenses decreased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003.
 
We believe that, in general, the level of our historical technical and operating expenses is largely indicative of future expense levels; however, as additional competition for product develops from new programming services, due to the availability of additional digital tier distribution mentioned above, costs for film and other programming content may increase.
 
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.6 million (8%) for 2004 as compared to 2003.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
 
The decrease in costs associated with the investigation into improper expense recognition is driven by a decrease of $4.7 million at AMC Networks for 2004 compared to 2003.  The increase in other general and administrative costs is primarily driven by an increase at AMC Networks of $10.9 million for 2004 compared to 2003.   The decrease in stock plan expenses of $1.9 million is driven by a decrease at AMC Networks and IFC of $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively.   The increase in sales and marketing costs is attributable to an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of  $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2004 compared to 2003.  Excluding the effects of the stock plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs decreased by the same percentage during 2004 as compared to 2003.
of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the sale to a third party of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications which had previously been fully reserved.
Other operating income
 
increased $15.5 million (28%) for 2004 as compared to 2003.  An increase of approximately $21.8 million resulted primarily from a full year of amortization of the step up in basis for intangibles acquired in July 2003 of which $21.1 million relates to AMC Networks, offset by a decrease of $6.0 million relating to the completed amortization in July 2004 of an intangible asset that AMC Networks acquired in 1994.
Depreciation and amortization
 
increased $41.5 million during 2004 compared to 2003.  The increase was primarily attributable to the interest expense on the notes and bank debt described herein.
Net interest expense
 
of $0.4 million in 2003 represent costs written off in connection with the termination of a credit agreement.
Write-off of deferred financing costs
 
decreased $17.2 million in 2004 reflecting MGM's 2003 interest in the net income of our subsidiaries.  MGM's interest in those subsidiaries was acquired in July 2003, resulting in no minority interest in 2004.
Minority interests
 
of $48.7 million and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively, resulted primarily from the pretax income multiplied by the statutory rate for federal and state taxes and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate in 2004.
Income tax expense
 
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2003 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2002
 
for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $83.9 million (24%) as compared to revenues for the prior year.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
 
The increase in net revenue from advertising is driven by increases in AMC Networks and IFC of $46.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  The increase in net revenue from network subscribers and rate increases is driven by increases at AMC Networks of $22.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively.  During 2002, AMC Networks and IFC recorded bad debt expense of $6.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively associated with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications.
 
include primarily costs to license programming including feature films, and programming and production costs.
Technical and operating expenses
Technical and operating expenses for 2003 increased $27.6 million (24%) compared to 2002.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
 
 
During 2003, impairment charges recorded related to films amounted to $17.1 million and $0.8 million at AMC Networks and IFC, respectively.  The increase in programming and production costs, including contractual rights, is primarily attributable to an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $7.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained consistent during 2003 as compared to 2002.
 
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $34.4 million (32%) for 2003 as compared to 2002.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
 
During 2003, AMC Networks and IFC incurred costs associated with the investigation into improper expense recognition amounting to $10.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  The increase in other general and administrative costs is driven by an increase at IFC of $6.5 million. The increase in stock plan expenses of $5.9 million is primarily driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $4.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.   The increase in sales and marketing costs is attributable to an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of  $7.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% in 2003 compared to 2002.  Excluding the effects of the stock plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 1% during 2003 as compared to 2002.
 
of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, of which approximately $3.1 million and $1.2 million was recorded by AMC Networks and IFC, respectively, resulted from the sale to a third party of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications which had previously been fully reserved.
Other operating income
 
increased $28.0 million (99%) for 2003 as compared to 2002.  An increase of approximately $26.7 million, of which $25.0 million is attributable to AMC
Depreciation and amortization
Networks, resulted primarily from a full year of amortization of the step up in basis for intangibles and property and equipment in the NBC transactions during 2002, and approximately five months of amortization of the step up in basis of intangibles acquired in the MGM transaction in July 2003.  The remaining $1.3 million resulted primarily from depreciation of fixed asset additions.
 
decreased $0.8 million (78%) during 2003 compared to 2002.  The decrease was primarily attributable to higher interest expense ($2.5 million in 2003 as compared to $2.1 million in 2002).
Net interest income (expense)
 
of $0.4 million in 2003 and $1.9 million in 2002 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, credit agreements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
The operations of the businesses that are included in our consolidated financial statements collectively have historically generated net cash flow from operations and have limited capital expenditures and accordingly, have limited borrowing requirements.
 
The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and present value of capital leases as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004:
 
 
Total amounts payable by the Company in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004 and thereafter, including capital leases, are as follows:
 
In August 2004, we entered into new debt financing arrangements totaling approximately $1,750.0 million consisting of a $950.0 million senior secured credit facility of a $600.0 million term loan and $350.0 million undrawn revolving credit facility, and senior and senior subordinated notes totaling approximately $800.0 million.  Substantially all of the net proceeds of the new financings, approximately $1,366.3 million, were distributed to our indirect parent, Rainbow Media Enterprises.
 
The senior secured credit facility is secured by the assets and stock of AMC, WE and IFC and is guaranteed by AMC, WE, IFC and Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, our direct parent.  The term loan requires amortization of 0.25% per quarter beginning June 30, 2005 through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% for each quarter ending June 30, 2011 through March 31, 2012, its maturity date.  Outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility were $600.0 million as of March 21, 2005, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $350.0 million.  Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total leverage of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined, based on the consolidated cash flows of AMC, WE and IFC) through December 31, 2006 with reductions thereafter, (ii) a maximum senior leverage of 5.0 times cash flow, reducing to 4.75 times on October 1, 2005 with further reductions thereafter and (iii) minimum ratios for cash flow to debt service (all as defined in the credit agreement).  Additional covenants include restrictions on distributions, additional indebtedness, and liens.  Permitted distributions include up to $150.0 million annually, with a cumulative limit of $600.0 million, to fund Rainbow DBS Holdings, Inc. and Rainbow HD Holdings LLC (collectively "Rainbow DBS"); up to $50.0 million annually, with a cumulative limit of $200.0 million, for other general purposes; and subject to maintaining a maximum ratio of total debt to cash flow of 5.0 times, distributions of up to $300.0 million from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings.  The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of December 31, 2004.
 
Our notes offerings consist of $300.0 million face amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012 and $500.0 million face amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014.  Net proceeds from these offerings totaled $775.9 million.  These issuances are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.  Principal covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 7.0 times, reducing to 6.0 times after January 1, 2009, limitations on distributions and limitations on the ability to incur liens (as per the terms of the senior note indenture).
 
Although the debt service requirements of the new financings are significant, cash flow from operations, (net of the debt service requirements) is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's commitments for the next twelve months.
 
On the date of issuance of the senior and senior subordinated notes, American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") issued 3,500,000 shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350.0 million to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a capital distribution.  No dividends were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004.
On November 5, 2004, the Board of Directors of Cablevision authorized the Company to modify the terms of the distribution to eliminate the retained redeemable preferred membership interest in AMC LLC.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the elimination will be to reduce debt by $350.0 million and increase member's equity by the same amount in 2005.
 
At December 31, 2004, long-term assets include $155.6 million of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC.  In March 2005, this amount was converted to equity and recorded as a capital distribution.
 
Suspension of Planned Spin-off of Rainbow Media Enterprises and Sale of Rainbow DBS Assets
 
In January 2005, Cablevision's Board of Directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of Rainbow DBS and the shutdown of its business. On January 20, 2005, Rainbow DBS entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of EchoStar Communications Corp. for $200 million in cash. This transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. In February 2005, Cablevision signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from Cablevision the business, assets and liabilities of Cablevision's Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in Cablevision's definitive agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Cablevision and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached.
In December 2004, Cablevision announced its Board of Directors had decided to suspend pursuing the planned spin-off of Rainbow Media Enterprises in its then proposed form and would instead pursue strategic alternatives for its Rainbow DBS business. 
 
Following the expiration of the letter of intent, Cablevision began shutting down the Rainbow DBS operations. In March 2005, Cablevision entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan ("March 2005 Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from Cablevision. Cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at Rainbow DBS during the term of the March 2005 Agreement. Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to Cablevision cash or shares of Cablevision's common stock in advance of Cablevision making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, Cablevision will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. In March 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $15 million with Cablevision in accordance with the March 2005 Agreement.
 
The March 2005 Agreement between Cablevision and Charles and Thomas Dolan terminates on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. In the event of a shutdown, Cablevision anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early
termination of various contracts, other contractual obligations, employee termination benefits and other costs. In the event of a shutdown, assuming the consummation of the Rainbow 1 sale to Echostar, Cablevision does not expect any material impact to its liquidity position.
 
On March 28, 2005, VOOM HD, LLC and the Association of Consumers to Preserve and Promote DBS Competition filed a Joint Petition to deny the applications for approval of the EchoStar transaction pending at the Federal Communications Commission.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Statement No. 153 addresses the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.  Statement No. 153 eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  Previously, Opinion 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished.  The Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  The provisions of Statement No. 153 will be adopted for all nonmonetary exchanges initiated after June 15, 2005 and therefore had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (Statement No. 123R). Statement No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. Statement No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awardthe requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Statement No. 123R is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Cablevision will be required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 123R beginning with its fiscal quarter commencing on July 1, 2005, and therefore the Statement had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cablevision has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect that the adoption will have on its financial position or results of operations.
