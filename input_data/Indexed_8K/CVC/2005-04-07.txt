               On March 8, 2005, Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan, the Chairman of the Company, and Thomas C. Dolan, a director of the Company, pursuant to which the parties were to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of the Company's Rainbow DBS subsidiary from the Company. That agreement terminated on March 31, 2005 and, in accordance with its terms, the business of Rainbow DBS is to be shut down. All expenditures of Rainbow DBS after March 31, 2005 are being funded by the Company.
               The Board of Directors, at a meeting on April 7, 2005, confirmed its shut down decision and provided management with specific directives on shut down implementation including advising customers that the VOOM service will cease to be available on April 30, 2005. Management has begun implementing the shut down steps. The Board of Directors instructed management to continue to analyze whether its VOOM 21 channels can be marketed to other satellite and cable providers as part of the Company's Rainbow programming operations.
