FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2005 RESULTS
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005.  Consolidated net revenue grew 6% to over $1.2 billion, operating income increased $69.9 million to $74.9 million, and adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF)* grew 30% to $353.7 million, all as compared to the year-earlier period.  The company's results reflect strong revenue growth in the company's Telecommunications Services segment as well as revenue growth at AMC, IFC and WE networks, partially offset by lower revenue at Other Programming entities within the Rainbow segment and Madison Square Garden.
Bethpage, N.Y., May 5, 2005
 
Highlights for the first quarter include:
 
Basic subscriber gains for the fourth consecutive quarter in Cable Television
 - 
                 
Revenue Generating Unit (RGU) growth of over 341,000 new units during the quarter resulting from growth in video, high-speed data and voice customers
 - 
                 
More than 1.2 million RGUs added across Cable Television's services from Q1'04
 - 
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 15% and AOCF growth of 19%
 - 
                 
 
"Cablevision had a strong start to 2005 with solid gains in consolidated net revenues, operating income and adjusted operating cash flow, fueled largely by impressive revenue growth in the company's core cable operations.  The company achieved basic sub growth in the first quarter that was greater than that achieved in the entire previous year, and continued to add to the highest penetration rates in the industry for high-speed data, digital video and our voice service, which enjoyed record-breaking growth in the period."
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:
 
"Rainbow Media's AMC, IFC, and WE also had a solid first quarter.  This was driven by a significant increase in advertising revenue, principally at AMC, which experienced its strongest ratings quarter ever," concluded Mr. Dolan.
 
Results from Continuing Operations
 
The operating results of FSN Ohio, FSN Florida and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations are included in discontinued operations and are not presented in the table below.  The VOOM 21 HD Originals are included in the Rainbow segment for all periods presented.
 
Segment results for the periods ended March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004 are as follows:
 
 
*  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 4 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 5 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income and net loss.
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
 
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  the company's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
 
First quarter Telecommunications Services net revenues rose 15% to $851.1 million, operating income increased 32% to $111.7 million, and AOCF increased 18% to $325.4 million, all as compared to the year-earlier period.
 
Cable Television 
 
Cable Television includes the results of Optimum Online for business, previously reported as part of Lightpath operations.  Prior periods have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
 
Cable Television first quarter net revenues increased 15% to $813.5 million, operating income increased 29% to $120.5 million and AOCF rose 19% to $311.3 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF reflect the addition of over 1.2 million Revenue Generating Units from the first quarter 2004 resulting from growth in basic video, digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers.
 
Highlights include:
 
customers up 21,800 or 0.7% from December and 40,927 or 1.4% from March 2004
 - 
                 
Basic video
customers up 139,928 or 9% from December and  567,234 or 54% from March 2004
 - 
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 88,038 or 7% from December and 311,649 or 28% from March 2004
 - 
                 
Optimum Online
high-speed data
customers up 91,792 or 34% from December and 293,666 from March 2004, a four-fold increase
 - 
                 
Optimum Voice
up 341,148 or 6% from December and 1,211,832 or 23% from March 2004
 - 
                 
Revenue Generating Units
of $91.18, up $2.85 or 3% from December and $11.35 or 14% from March 2004
 - 
                 
Cable
RPS
revenue up 12% from March 2004
 - 
                 
Advertising
of 38.3% compared to 37.3% in March 2004
 - 
                 
AOCF margin
 
Lightpath 
 
For the first quarter, Lightpath net revenues increased 22% to $47.7 million, operating losses increased 5% to $8.7 million and AOCF increased 14% to $14.1 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The revenue and AOCF increases of 22% and 14%, respectively, are primarily attributable to revenue growth in data services over Lightpath's fiber infrastructure.  The increase in Lightpath's operating loss is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense compared to the prior year period.  Lightpath revenue also includes Optimum Voice call completion activity, which has no impact on AOCF.
 
Rainbow
 
Rainbow consists of our AMC, IFC and WE national programming services as well as Other Programming that includes: FSN Chicago, FSN Bay Area, fuse, Mag Rack, News 12 Networks, MetroChannels, IFC Entertainment, VOOM 21 HD Originals, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow developmental ventures.
 
First quarter Rainbow net revenues decreased 10% to $200.5 million, operating income decreased 41% to $4.7 million and AOCF decreased 6% to $39.3 million, all compared to the year-earlier period.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
 
First quarter net revenues increased 7% to $135.0 million, operating income increased 19% to $47.8 million and AOCF increased 4% to $63.2 million, each compared to the prior year period.
First quarter results reflect:
A 21% increase in advertising revenue driven by higher sellout rates, offset in part by higher marketing and production expenses
 - 
                 
AMC primetime ratings increase of 5% season-to-date
 - 
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 11% at IFC, 6% at WE and 2% at AMC
 - 
                 
 
Other Programming
 
First quarter net revenues decreased 32% to $72.3 million, operating loss increased to $43.1 million from $32.3 million, and the AOCF deficit increased to $23.9 million from $18.8 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The decrease in revenue is primarily due to the loss of professional sports content at FSN Chicago as well as the timing of certain affiliate settlements received by the FSN networks in the first quarter of 2004.  The increased AOCF deficit and operating loss primarily reflect the lower revenue at the FSN networks, partially offset by lower expenses at the VOOM 21 HD Originals and MetroChannels.
 
Madison Square Garden
 
Madison Square Garden's businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.
 
Madison Square Garden's first quarter net revenue declined 12% to $179.5 million from $204.5 million in the first quarter of 2004.  Operating loss decreased to $11.9 million from a loss of $34.8 million and AOCF increased to $3.3 million from a deficit of $19.8 million, both as compared to the year-earlier period.
 
MSG's first quarter results are primarily impacted by:
 
The loss of NHL hockey games during the period which resulted in reduced revenues, more than offset by certain expense savings
 - 
                 
Higher Knicks ticket revenues and revenue gains at Radio City Entertainment
 - 
                 
Reduced Knicks luxury tax expense compared to the year-earlier period
 - 
                 
 
Consolidated Results
 
Consolidated results exclude FSN Ohio, FSN Florida, and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations, which are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Consolidated first quarter results compared to the prior year period are as follows:
 
Net revenues increased 6% to $1.2 billion, resulting from continued customer growth in Cable Television as well as revenue growth at AMC, IFC and WE networks, partially offset by lower revenues in Other Programming and at Madison Square Garden.
 - 
                 
Operating income totaled $74.9 million compared to $5.0 million and consolidated AOCF increased 30% to $353.7 million.  The increases in operating income and AOCF result from revenue growth in the Telecommunications Services segment, the expense reductions at Madison Square Garden discussed above, and decreases in other corporate general and administrative expenses.
 - 
                 
 
2005 Outlook
 
The company affirms the previously issued full year 2005 guidance outlined below:
 
 
* Percentage growth
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Statement of Cash Flows.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt service and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
