ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. In 2003, Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") issued awards under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan to executive officers and employees of the Company's cable and telecommunications segment and to corporate staff. These awards were issued in lieu of bonuses that would otherwise have been payable in respect of performance in 2002. The issuance of the awards instead of paying cash bonuses allowed the Company to preserve liquidity. The awards were to become payable upon the Company achieving free cash flow. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that free cash flow was achieved in 2004. The free cash flow measure used by the Compensation Committee excluded the Company's Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business which has been discontinued. The Company expects that these payments will be made to approximately 600 individuals and will aggregate approximately $37.7 million, substantially all of which had been accrued at December 31, 2004. The following named executive officers listed in the Company's 2005 Proxy Statement will receive payments under their awards as follows: William J. Bell - $1,750,000; James L. Dolan - $2,800,000; Hank J. Ratner - $700,000; and Thomas M. Rutledge - $ 1,120,000. In addition, the following directors and officers of the Company will receive payments under their awards: Charles F. Dolan - $2,800,000 and Brian G. Sweeney - $315,000. -2-
