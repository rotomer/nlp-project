FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2005 RESULTS SIXTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF BASIC SUBSCRIBER GAINS
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005.  Consolidated net revenue grew 11% to over $1.2 billion compared to the year-earlier period, reflecting strong revenue growth in Telecommunications Services; Madison Square Garden; and AMC, IFC and WE networks, offset in part by lower revenue in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.  Operating income increased 8% to $107.2 million and adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")* increased 3% to $378.6 million.
Bethpage, N.Y., November 8, 2005
 
Highlights for the third quarter include:
 
Sixth consecutive quarter of basic subscriber gains
 - 
                 
Revenue Generating Unit (RGU) growth of more than 308,000 new video, high-speed data and voice units
 - 
                 
More than 1.3 million RGUs added across Cable Television's services since Q3'04
 - 
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 16% and AOCF growth of 11% as compared to Q3'04
 - 
                 
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision had another excellent quarter with increases in net revenue, operating income and adjusted operating cash flow.  This success was driven by the strength of our video, voice and Internet services, which continue to enjoy industry-leading penetration rates.  Additional highlights for the third quarter include our sixth consecutive quarter of basic subscriber growth as well as impressive subscriber gains for our digital video service.  Our voice service also achieved excellent results and, by the end of the third quarter, more than one out of every three Cablevision high-speed data customers also purchased Optimum Voice."
 
"Rainbow Media's AMC, IFC and WE had an impressive quarter as well with increases in both net revenues and adjusted operating cash flow.  This growth was fueled by a double-digit increase in advertising revenue, principally at AMC and WE, which both experienced record ratings in the third quarter," concluded Mr. Dolan.
 
Results from Continuing Operations
 
The operating results of FSN Ohio, FSN Florida and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations are included in discontinued operations and are not presented in the table below.  The VOOM HD Networks are included in the Rainbow segment for all periods presented.
 
Segment results for the quarters ended September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004 are as follows:
 
 
*  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 4 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income and net income (loss).
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
 
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
 
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the third quarter rose 16% to $910.6 million, operating income increased 23% to $141.6 million, and AOCF increased 11% to $353.7 million, all as compared to the year-earlier period.
 
Cable Television 
 
Cable Television third quarter net revenues increased 16% to $872.3 million, operating income increased 20% to $146.0 million and AOCF rose 11% to $338.5 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF reflect the addition of more than 1.3 million Revenue Generating Units since the third quarter of 2004, resulting from growth in video, high-speed data, and voice customers.
 
Highlights include:
 
customers up 3,506 or 0.1% from June 2005 and 56,851 or 1.9% from September 2004; sixth consecutive quarter of basic subscriber gains
 - 
                 
Basic video
customers up 101,611 or 6% from June 2005 and 506,003 or 38% from September 2004

AOCF margin
 
Lightpath
 
For the third quarter, Lightpath net revenues increased 15% to $49.4 million, operating loss decreased 34% to $4.5 million and AOCF increased 20% to $15.2 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in revenue and AOCF is primarily attributable to revenue growth in Ethernet data services over Lightpath's fiber infrastructure as well as growth in traditional data services.  The improvements in operating loss and AOCF reflect the revenue growth as well as certain expense savings resulting primarily from staff reductions implemented earlier in the year.  Lightpath revenue also includes Optimum Voice call completion activity, which has no impact on AOCF.
 
Rainbow
 
Rainbow consists of our AMC, IFC and WE:  Women's Entertainment national programming services as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Chicago, FSN Bay Area, fuse, MagRack, Sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Metro Channels, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow developmental ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the third quarter decreased 9% to $211.9 million, operating income increased 73% to $19.2 million and AOCF increased 3% to $46.1 million, all compared to the year-earlier period.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
 
Third quarter net revenues increased 11% to $144.2 million, operating income increased 25% to $52.3 million and AOCF increased 15% to $68.5 million, each compared to the prior year period.
The third quarter results reflect:
 
Higher advertising revenue driven by continued ratings growth, with AMC recording its strongest quarter ever with a primetime HH rating of .98
 - 
                 
Higher affiliate revenue, primarily due to the recognition in the third quarter of affiliate revenue attributable to the second quarter that was not recognized in the second quarter due to a contractual dispute
 - 
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 9% at IFC, 3% at WE and 2% at AMC as compared to September 2004
 - 
                 
 
Other Programming
 
Third quarter net revenues decreased 34% to $72.6 million, operating loss increased $2.5 million to $33.1 million, and the AOCF deficit increased $7.7 million to $22.4 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower affiliate revenue at FSN Chicago resulting from the termination of contracts after losing professional sports content and from payments not being received in accordance with an existing affiliate agreement and the closure of two Metro Channels.  The increases in operating loss and AOCF deficit primarily reflect the net revenue losses as well as higher expenses at IFC Films and News 12, offset in part by lower amortization of contractual rights at VOOM HD Networks.
 
Madison Square Garden
 
Madison Square Garden's businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.
 
Madison Square Garden's third quarter net revenue increased 23% to $135.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2004.  Operating income decreased $18.6 million to an operating loss of $15.8 million and AOCF decreased to $1.8 million from $15.2 million in the third quarter, both as compared to the year-earlier period.  MSG's third quarter results were primarily impacted by:
 
Higher network affiliate revenue, including the impact of certain contractual retroactive rate adjustments
 - 
                 
Higher net charges for personnel transactions at the Knicks and Rangers
 - 
                 
Impact of certain other events, primarily the favorable result of the Republican National Convention in 2004 and the expenses associated with the Hurricane Katrina benefit concerts in September 2005.
 - 
                 
 
Total Company (Results From Continuing Operations)
 
Consolidated results exclude FSN Ohio, FSN Florida, and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations, which are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Consolidated third quarter results compared to the prior year period are as follows:
 
Net revenues increased 11% to $1.2 billion.  This was the result of continued RGU growth in Cable Television as well as net revenue growth at Madison Square Garden and AMC, IFC and WE networks, partially offset by a decrease in net revenues at Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.
 - 
                 
Operating income increased 8% to $107.2 million and consolidated AOCF increased 3% to $378.6 million.  The increases in operating income and AOCF reflect the factors discussed above, offset by higher expenses at Madison Square Garden and higher advisory fees related to corporate transactions.
 - 
                 
2005 Outlook
 
The company affirms and updates the previously issued full year 2005 guidance as outlined in the table below:
 
 
* Percentage growth
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of its business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
 
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Statement of Cash Flows.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt service and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
