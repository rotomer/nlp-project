ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On October 31, 2005, the Board of Directors of Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") authorized Cablevision management to take all steps that would be necessary to implement a $3 billion special dividend payable pro rata to all shareholders subject to, among other things, obtaining the necessary financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the Board and final Board approval after completion of its ongoing analysis of the proposed dividend. Cablevision continues to analyze the proposed dividend, and, together with CSC Holdings, Inc., is evaluating a new CSC Holdings, Inc. credit facility of up to $5.5 billion, secured by the stock of certain subsidiaries. The new credit facility would (i) be used to refund and replace the existing CSC Holdings, Inc. credit facility, (ii) provide the funds for the special dividend, if one is declared by the Board, and (iii) provide for up to $1.0 billion of initially undrawn revolving credit availability. -2-
