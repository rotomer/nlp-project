ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. Cablevision Systems Corporation announced today that during the course of preparing for the financing of its proposed special dividend, it ascertained that there were certain technical covenant violations under CSC Holdings, Inc.'s existing bank credit agreement and certain possible technical covenant violations under other debt instruments. The Company is in the process of and intends promptly to complete a comprehensive covenant compliance review, seek waivers under its bank credit agreement and, if necessary, seek waivers under its other debt instruments and consider the impact of such potential covenant violations on the classification of debt in its prior financial statements. As a result of these matters, on December 18, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors decided not to proceed with the proposed special dividend. The recently announced senior note offering will not proceed. The Company believes that its operations have not been impacted by these actual and possible covenant violations described above and believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its operating requirements.
