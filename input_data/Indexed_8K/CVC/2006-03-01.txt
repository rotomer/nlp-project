FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2005.
Bethpage, N.Y., February 27, 2006
 
Fourth quarter consolidated net revenue grew 12.5% to just under $1.5 billion compared to the year-earlier period, reflecting strong revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Madison Square Garden, offset in part by lower revenue from Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.  Operating income for the quarter was $212.8 million compared to a fourth quarter operating loss of $50.2 million in 2004 and adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"*) increased 49.2% to $479.7 million.  (Fourth quarter 2004 operating loss and AOCF include impairment charges of $166.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively, related to the VOOM HD Networks and certain Rainbow DBS assets.)
 
For the full year 2005, consolidated net revenue increased 9.0% to $5.2 billion, driven by the addition of over 1.3 million Revenue Generating Units during the year in Telecommunications Services combined with revenue growth at AMC, IFC and WE networks and Madison Square Garden, and offset in part by lower revenue in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.  Full year 2005 operating income increased to $502.4 million from $252.6 million in 2004 and AOCF increased 13.2% to $1.6 billion in 2005 from $1.4 billion in 2004.  (The increase in operating income and AOCF was impacted by certain events in 2004, including receipts and credits of $106.1 million that favorably impacted Madison Square Garden and the impairment charges noted above.)
 
Highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 include:
 
Seventh consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains; 2.2% growth for the year
 - 
                 
Record annual Revenue Generating Unit growth of more than 1.3 million including the addition of over 450,000 new voice customers
 - 
                 
Telecommunications Services revenue growth of 15.8% and 15.5% and AOCF growth of 16.6% and 15.1% for the quarter and full year, respectively
 - 
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") exceeded $100 in the fourth quarter 2005
 - 
                 
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "In 2005, Cablevision enjoyed industry-leading success in our cable division, which propelled us to exceed the $5 billion revenue mark for the first time in the company's history.  In addition, the company experienced double-digit AOCF growth for the full year.  Cablevision continues to achieve industry-leading penetration rates in digital and analog video, voice, and data services and in 2005 we more than doubled our voice subscribers to more than 730,000 customers and achieved our seventh consecutive quarter of basic subscriber growth.  This momentum helped Cablevision meet its financial objectives in 2005 and positions the company well to seize the opportunities that lie ahead."
 
*  Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding employee stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 5 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 7for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
 
Telecommunications Services net revenue for the fourth quarter 2005 rose 15.8% to $949.7 million, operating income increased 46.2% to $166.1 million, and AOCF increased 16.6% to $378.9 million, all as compared to the year-earlier period.
 
Full year 2005 net revenue rose 15.5% to $3.6 billion, operating income increased 31.1% to $554.7 million, and AOCF increased 15.1% to $1.4 billion, all as compared to the year-earlier period.
 
Cable Television 
Cable Television fourth quarter 2005 net revenue increased 16.1% to $909.6 million, operating income increased 38.6% to $168.0 million and AOCF rose 16.6% to $361.7 million, each compared to the year-earlier period.  The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF resulted principally from growth in video, high-speed data and voice customers which is reflected in the addition of more than 1.3 million Revenue Generating Units during 2005.
 
Highlights include:
 
customers up 17,930 or 0.6% for the quarter and 63,993 or 2.2% for the year; the company's seventh consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains
 - 
                 
Basic video
customers up 119,496 or 6.5% for the quarter and 479,566 or 32.3% for the year
 - 
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 93,900 or 5.9% for the quarter and 341,793 or 25.3% for the year
 - 
                 
Optimum Online
high-speed data
customers up 130,133 or 21.6% for the quarter and 458,653 or 168.2% for the year
 - 
                 
Optimum Voice

 - 
                 
AOCF margin
Lightpath
For the fourth quarter 2005, Lightpath net revenue increased 14.8% to $50.8 million, operating loss improved $5.7 million to $1.8 million and AOCF increased 16.3% to $17.2 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The positive changes in revenue, AOCF and operating loss are attributable primarily to growth in Ethernet data services over Lightpath's fiber infrastructure and to growth in traditional data services.  The improvements in operating loss and AOCF also reflect the positive impact of certain 2005 settlement agreements totaling $2.3 million.  Lightpath revenue also includes Optimum Voice call completion activity, which has no net impact on AOCF.  Lightpath revenue growth excluding Optimum Voice call activity would have increased 8.2%.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our AMC, IFC and WE: Women's Entertainment national programming services as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Chicago, FSN Bay Area, fuse, Mag Rack, Sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Metro Channels, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow developmental ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenue for the fourth quarter 2005 decreased 4.0% to $212.4 million, operating loss improved  $182.9 million to an operating income of $21.6 million and AOCF deficit improved $81.0 million to a positive AOCF of $43.1 million, all compared to the year-earlier period.  The decline in revenue principally relates to Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.  The fourth quarter improvement in operating income and AOCF reflects the 2004 impairment charges of $166.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively, related to the VOOM HD Networks and certain Rainbow DBS assets.
 
Full year 2005 net revenue decreased 10.3% to $829.0 million mainly due to lower affiliate revenue at FSN Chicago.  Operating loss improved $163.6 million to an operating income of $37.2 million and AOCF increased 65.3% to $157.9 million, compared to the year-earlier period.  Full year 2004 operating results were also impacted by the impairment charges discussed above.
 
AMC/IFC/WE
Fourth quarter 2005 net revenue increased 4.0% to $142.5 million, operating income increased 36.5% to $53.0 million and AOCF increased 19.6% to $66.3 million, each compared to the prior year period.
 
The fourth quarter results reflect:
Higher advertising revenue, offset in part by lower affiliate revenue
 - 
                 
Favorable impact from the timing of production and marketing expenditures compared to the prior year period
 - 
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 7.8% at IFC, 1.9% at WE and 1.5% at AMC as compared to December 2004
 - 
                 
 
Other Programming
Fourth quarter 2005 net revenue decreased 19.0% to $75.0 million, operating loss decreased 84.3% to $31.4 million, and AOCF deficit decreased 75.1% to $23.2 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower affiliate revenue at FSN Chicago, resulting from the termination of certain contracts after losing professional sports content; from payments not being received in accordance with an existing affiliate agreement; and from the closure of two Metro Channels.  This was offset in part by increased revenue at fuse and IFC Entertainment.  The improvement in operating loss and AOCF deficit is primarily the result of the impact of the 2004 impairment charges and is offset in part by the net revenue losses described above.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.
 
Madison Square Garden's fourth quarter 2005 net revenue increased 13.4% to $338.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.  Operating income increased 70.5% to $70.5 million and AOCF increased 56.2% to $85.7 million in the fourth quarter, both as compared to the year-earlier period.  MSG's fourth quarter 2005 results were primarily impacted by:
 
An increase in revenue and expense relating to the impact of the 2005/2006 hockey season as compared to the NHL lock-out the prior year
 - 
                 
Lower net charges for team personnel transactions, offset in part by an NBA luxury tax provision for 2005/2006
 - 
                 
Lower New York Mets rights expense
 - 
                 
 
For the full year 2005, net revenue increased 3.3% to $804.4 million, operating income decreased 54.5% to $53.3 million and AOCF decreased 29.2% to $120.4 million, all as compared to the year-earlier period. The 2004 period included receipts and credits of $106.1 million, relating to the termination of the New York Mets rights agreement and NBA expansion revenue.
 
Total Company (Results from Continuing Operations)
Consolidated results exclude FSN Ohio, FSN Florida, and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations, which are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
Consolidated fourth quarter 2005 results compared to the prior year period are as follows:
 
Consolidated net revenue grew 12.5% to $1.5 billion compared to the year-earlier period, reflecting strong revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Madison Square Garden, offset in part by lower revenue in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.
 - 
                 
Operating income for the quarter was $212.8 million compared to an operating loss of $50.2 million and AOCF increased 49.2% to $479.7 million as compared to fourth quarter 2004.  The fourth quarter 2004 operating loss and AOCF include impairment charges of $166.3 million and $75.8 million, respectively, related to the VOOM HD Networks and certain Rainbow DBS assets.  Excluding these items, the company's fourth quarter operating income and AOCF would have increased 83.1% and 20.7%, respectively.  The increases in operating income and AOCF principally relate to the revenue growth discussed above.
 - 
                 
 
Full year 2005 results compared to the prior year are as follows:
 
2005 consolidated net revenue increased 9.0% to $5.2 billion, driven by the addition of over 1.3 million Revenue Generating Units during the year in Cable Television combined with revenue growth at AMC, IFC and WE networks and Madison Square Garden, offset in part by lower revenue in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses.
 - 
                 
Full year 2005 operating income increased to $502.4 million from $252.6 million in 2004 and AOCF increased 13.2% to $1.6 billion as compared to 2004.  The increase in operating income and AOCF was impacted by certain events in 2004, including receipts and credits of $106.1 million that favorably impacted Madison Square Garden and the impairment charges noted above in the total company quarterly results discussion.  Excluding these items, the company's full year operating income and AOCF would have increased 60.6% and 15.7%, respectively. The increases in operating income and AOCF principally relate to the revenue growth discussed above.

2006 Outlook
The company provides the following guidance for the full year 2006:
 
 
(a) Percentage growth
 
(b) The company's definition of AOCF excludes charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights; therefore, the 2006 outlook above excludes any potential impact of FASB Statement No. 123R, which the company will adopt effective January 1, 2006.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding charges or credits related to our employee stock plan, including those related to the vesting of restricted shares, variable stock options and stock appreciation rights, and restructuring charges or credits.  We believe that the exclusion of such amounts allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of a fluctuating stock price (in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights expense) or, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 7 of this release.
 
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Statement of Cash Flows.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt service and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
