The Board of Directors
Rainbow National Services LLC:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rainbow National Services LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, member's equity (deficiency) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Rainbow National Services LLC has operated as an integral part of Cablevision. As described in Notes 1 and 8, these consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Rainbow National Services LLC could differ from those that might have resulted had Rainbow National Services LLC been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rainbow National Services LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NOTE 1.
                                                   
 
Nature of Operations
 
In July 2004, Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") formed Rainbow National Services LLC (the "Company"). Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, owns 100% of the membership interests in the Company. The Company is a holding company with no independent operations. Its subsidiaries include entities that principally own nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment services operated as integral parts of Cablevision, including AMC, WE: Women's Entertainment ("WE") and The Independent Film Channel ("IFC"). The Company's consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations (see Note 8). The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company could differ from those that might have resulted had the Company been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
 
In August 2004, the common equity membership interests of American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") and its wholly owned subsidiaries (including WE: Women's Entertainment LLC ("WE LLC")) and The Independent Film Channel LLC ("IFC LLC") and its wholly owned subsidiaries were contributed to the Company. For accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests whereby the assets and liabilities were transferred at historical cost. Accordingly, the financial statements reflect the operations of the Company as if the transaction occurred on January 1, 2003.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes affiliate fee revenue from cable system or direct broadcast satellite operators as programming is provided to those cable system or direct broadcast satellite operators. Advertising revenue is recognized when commercials are telecast in accordance with the broadcast year which ends on the last Sunday on or prior to December 31. Each of the years in the accompanying statements of income included 52 weeks. In 2006, the broadcast year will include 53 weeks. In some situations, the Company's programming businesses guarantee certain viewer ratings for their programming. For these types of transactions, a portion of such revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized by providing additional advertising time.
st
Multiple-Element Transactions
 
If there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of accounting in a multiple-element arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate elements of accounting based on relative fair values. In certain situations, there may be cases in which there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered items. In those cases, the Company utilizes the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items.
 
The Company together with other subsidiaries of Cablevision, may enter into affiliation agreements which are documented in one or more contracts; however negotiated contemporaneously.  Amounts paid/received by other subsidiaries of Cablevision or the Company may differ from the amounts that would have been paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately.  Where Cablevision has incurred a cost incremental to fair value and the Company has received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations in the form of increased affiliation fee revenues, Cablevision charges the Company for the incremental amount.  Judgments made in determining fair value impact the amount and period in which revenues are recognized over the term of the affiliation agreement.  In determining fair value, the Company refers to historical transactions or comparable cash transactions.
 
Technical and Operating Expense
 
Costs of revenue related to sales of programming services including, but not limited to, license fees, amortization of film inventory, and production costs, are classified as "technical and operating" expenses in the accompanying statements of income.
 
Advertising Expenses
 
Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advertising costs were $45,286, $53,625 and $51,890 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating the collectibility of outstanding receivables and general factors such as length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and the economic and competitive environment.
 
Feature Film Programming Rights
 
See Note 3 for a discussion of impairment charges recorded in 2004 and 2003.
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then when the uncertainty is resolved.  Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight-line basis over the respective license periods. The Company periodically reviews the programming usefulness of feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness of exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If it is determined that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, a write-off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films is recorded. 
 
Feature Film Obligations
 
Amounts payable subsequent to December 31, 2005 related to the license of feature film inventory are as follows:
 
 
In July 2003, AMC LLC, WE LLC, IFC LLC and Rainbow Media Holdings LLC ("Rainbow Media Holdings"), as licensees, entered into an agreement with a film studio for feature film telecast rights. Each licensee recorded its allocated share of the film telecast rights and all of the payment obligations for which they are jointly and severally liable. Such payments initially amounted to $84,000 of which approximately $69,000 remained unpaid at December 31, 2005 and is included in the amounts above. Film assets of approximately $17,000 were allocated outside of the Company during 2003. Payments by affiliates for film assets allocated outside of the Company amounted to approximately $1,200, $700, and $1,100 during 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. The allocation of these film assets was treated as a deemed capital distribution in 2003 and the payments made by affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, were treated as deemed capital contributions in the consolidated statements of member's equity (deficiency).
 
Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments. Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of income.
 
Intangible assets established in connection with acquisitions consist of affiliation agreements, advertiser relationships, other intangibles and excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired.
 
These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, except excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") in purchase business combinations which has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized.
 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in a business combination.
 
Deferred Carriage Fees
 
Deferred carriage fees represent amounts paid or payable to cable system operators to guarantee carriage of certain programming services and are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related guarantee (1 to 13 years).
 
Deferred Financing Costs
 
Costs incurred to obtain debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the related debt.
 
Income Taxes
 
Income taxes are provided based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and permits the recognition of deferred tax assets, subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability. The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships.
 
The Company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Cablevision for the years presented herein. The income tax expense presented in the statements of income is based upon the taxable income of the Company on a separate return basis. Since there is no tax sharing
agreement in place between the Company and Cablevision, current and net deferred tax liabilities that the Company did not pay directly have been reflected as deemed contributions to the Company's capital.
 
Cash Flows
 
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company's non-cash investing and financing activities and other supplemental data were as follows:
 
 
During 2005, $155,567 of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings, the Company's indirect parent, were converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
 
During 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash equity distribution of approximately $1,400 to Rainbow Media Holdings to reflect the resolution of certain film rights agreements associated with Rainbow Media Holdings' sale of an affiliate in 2002.
 
During 2003, $32,000 of a note receivable from Rainbow Media Holdings was forgiven and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
 
Concentrations and Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash is invested in bank time deposits offered by financial institutions that have received the highest rating awarded by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. The Company had three customers that in the aggregate accounted for approximately 35% and 38% of the Company's consolidated net trade receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk. These customers accounted for approximately 40%, 41% and 46% of the Company's net revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Commitments and Contingencies
 
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
 
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Statement No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Statement No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Statement No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date in which the excess tax deductions result in a reduction of income taxes payable. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 regarding the SEC's interpretation of Statement No. 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies.
Cablevision will adopt Statement No. 123R on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application. The modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of the restricted share awards, stock option awards and stock appreciation rights outstanding at December 31, 2005 over the remaining service periods related to such awards. Cablevision will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments. In accordance with the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Cablevision recognized the majority of the share-based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method. Subsequent to January 1, 2006, Cablevision will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated recognition method and will recognize the cost for new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Cablevision has not quantified the impact of adopting Statement No. 123R which will in turn affect the amount that Cablevision allocates to the Company.
 
In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Statement No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. Statement No. 154 requires that a change in method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle. Statement No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
 
NOTE 2.
                                                
TRANSACTIONS
 
In July 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings repurchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'s ("MGM") 20% interest in each of AMC LLC, IFC LLC and WE LLC for $500,000 and entered into a film rights agreement relating to the MGM film library. The $500,000 purchase price consisted of $250,000 in cash and a $250,000 note issued by Cablevision and maturing five months after closing, payable in cash or, at Cablevision's election, shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock. The $250,000 note required monthly principal payments of $2,500 in cash prior to maturity. The net amount due at maturity was repaid in cash. The acquisition of this minority interest was accounted for as a purchase. The excess of the purchase price over the net book value of the assets acquired of approximately $415,661, has been pushed down to the respective subsidiaries of the Company as of the purchase date and was allocated to the specific assets acquired as follows:
 
NOTE 3.
                                                
IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
 
As part of its periodic review of expected programming usefulness, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0, $297, and $17,910 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Such amounts represent the write-off of the carrying value of the impaired film and programming contracts and are included in technical and operating expense. Impairment charges recorded for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 related to the AMC Networks segment amounted to $297 and $17,150, and amounts related to the IFC segment amounted to $760 in 2003.

NOTE 6.
DEBT
                                                
 
In August 2004, the Company entered into a $950,000 senior secured credit facility ($350,000 of which is a revolving credit facility maturing September 30, 2011 and $600,000 of which is a term loan facility maturing March 31, 2012). The senior secured credit facility is secured by the assets and common equity interests of AMC LLC, WE LLC and IFC LLC and guaranteed by AMC LLC, WE LLC and IFC LLC, Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, the Company's direct parent, and substantially all the other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Additionally, the Company issued senior and senior subordinated notes totaling $800,000. Proceeds from the credit facility and the senior and senior subordinated notes amounted to approximately $1,366,300 of which $1,366,150 was distributed to Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC and recorded as a capital distribution in 2004.
 
The term loan requires quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% ($1,500) of the original outstanding balance through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% ($141,000) of the original outstanding balance for each quarter ending June 30, 2011 through maturity on March 31, 2012. The revolving credit facility will be reduced quarterly commencing December 31, 2009 and through September 30, 2010, by $35,000, and for each quarter ending December 
31, 2010 through September 30, 2011 by $52,500. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan were $595,500 as of December 31, 2005, with $350,000 in undrawn revolver commitments.
 
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin based upon a leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Amounts outstanding under the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%. The interest rate under the term loan was 7.19% and 5.19% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow (as defined) of 6.75 times, through December 31, 2006 with periodic reductions thereafter to 5.00 times as of January 1, 2010, (ii) a maximum senior leverage ratio of senior debt (as defined) to annualized cash flow of 4.75 times through March 31, 2006 decreasing to 4.50 times through December 31, 2007, with periodic reductions thereafter to 3.50 times as of January 1, 2009, and (iii) minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense of 1.75 times and cash flow to debt service of 1.25 times through December 31, 2006 and 1.50 times thereafter (all as defined in the credit agreement). Additional covenants include restrictions on distributions, investments, additional indebtedness, and liens. Permitted investments and distributions include up to $200,000 annually, with a cumulative limit of $800,000 for general discretionary purposes; and subject to having a maximum ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow of 5.0 times, distributions and investments of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings.
 
The Company is also obligated to pay fees of 0.5% per annum on the undrawn revolver commitment which is recorded as interest expense.
 
The Company's notes outstanding consist of $300,000 face amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500,000 face amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014. These senior notes and the senior subordinated notes were discounted $2,163 and $3,915, respectively, upon original issuance. Net proceeds from these notes totaled approximately $775,900, net of financing costs. These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries. Principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 7.0 times, decreasing to 6.0 times after January 1, 2009, limitations on dividends and distributions, and limitations on investments and the ability to incur liens (according to the terms of the senior note indenture).
 
The Company may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of face value at any time on or after September 1, 2008, 102.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, and 100% on or after September 1, 2010. The senior subordinated notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 105.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, 103.458% on or after September 1, 2010, 101.729% on or after September 1, 2011, and 100% on or after September 1, 2012. The notes are redeemable at the redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.
 
In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the senior and the senior subordinated notes before September 1, 2007 at a redemption price of 108.75% and 110.375% of the principal amounts, respectively, with the net cash proceeds from specified equity offerings (as defined
under the terms of the indentures) provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding immediately subsequent to the redemption.
 
The indentures under which the senior and senior subordinated notes were issued contain various covenants, which are generally less restrictive than those contained in the credit agreement.
 
The Company has no independent assets or operations of its own, the guarantees under the senior and senior subordinated notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, and any subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. There are no restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of the subsidiary guarantors to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
 
In August 2004, AMC LLC issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution. In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC. The impact of the contribution was to reduce debt by $350,000 and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
 
In March 2003, AMC LLC, WE LLC, and IFC LLC entered into a $75,000 credit facility consisting of a $40,000 revolver and a $35,000 term loan, secured by all of the assets of the borrowers. In December 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings entered into an $823,000 credit facility consisting of a $200,000 revolving credit facility and a $623,000 term loan, maturing on March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively. This facility amended and combined the previously existing Rainbow Media Holdings' $300,000 credit facility and the AMC LLC, WE LLC and IFC LLC $75,000 credit facility entered into in March 2003. As a result, Rainbow Media Holdings assumed the obligation of the AMC LLC, WE LLC, and IFC LLC term loan which was recorded as a deemed capital contribution in the amount of approximately $35,000.
 
In August 2004, proceeds in the amount of $704,900 from the debt financing arrangements described above were utilized by Rainbow Media Holdings to repay all outstanding amounts under its credit facility and collateralized outstanding letters of credit.
 
Debt Covenant Compliance
 
In January 2006, Cablevision completed a comprehensive debt covenant compliance review that it announced on December 19, 2005. The review identified certain technical covenant compliance issues under the Company's credit facility. The Company received waivers from the lenders under the credit facility and certain technical and clarifying amendments have been made to the Company's credit facility. No fees were paid to the lenders and counterparties in connection with these waivers and amendments. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt agreements and instruments.
Summary of Five-Year Debt Maturities
 
Total amounts payable by the Company under its various debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2005, during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2005 are as follows:

LEASES
                                                
 
Cablevision, and companies owned or managed by Cablevision, lease certain office facilities under long-term lease agreements with non-affiliates. The leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals plus certain real estate taxes and other costs. The Company pays its share of monthly lease payments for the portion of the premises occupied by its employees. Rent expense incurred by the Company which was allocated by Cablevision or a company owned or managed by Cablevision for such leases was approximately $1,298, $1,871 and $3,125, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
 
Certain subsidiaries of the Company lease certain office facilities and transmission equipment under long-term non-cancelable operating lease agreements with non-affiliates which expire at various dates through 2021. The leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals plus certain other costs. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $4,759, $3,966, and $4,759, respectively.
 
The minimum future annual rentals for all operating leases with non-affiliates (with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year) during the next five years and thereafter, at rates now in force are as follows:
 
 
The Company leases equipment (primarily satellite equipment) under capital leases, which expire in 2006. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the gross amount of equipment and related accumulated depreciation recorded under these leases were as follows:
 
 
Future minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 2005 are as follows:

AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS
                                                
 
Allocations
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the application of certain allocation policies of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings, which are summarized below. Management believes that these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis. However, it is not practicable to determine whether the allocated amounts represent amounts that might have been incurred on a stand-alone basis, as there are no company-specific or comparable industry benchmarks with which to make such estimates. Explanations of the composition and the amounts of the more significant allocations are described below.
 
Corporate General and Administrative Costs
 
General and administrative costs, including costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions (such as human resources, legal, finance, tax, audit, treasury, strategic planning, information technology, creative and production services, etc.) have been allocated by Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings. Certain allocations are generally based on relative revenues or expenses of the Company in relation to those of consolidated Rainbow Media Holdings. The remaining overhead, principally salaries of corporate executives, is primarily allocated based on management's estimate of the level of effort expended on each business unit based on historical trends. Such costs allocated to the Company amounted to $30,229, $28,332 and $20,940 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Health and Welfare Plans
 
Employees of the Company participate in health and welfare plans sponsored by Cablevision. Health and welfare benefit costs have generally been allocated by Cablevision based upon the proportionate number of participants in the plans. Such costs amounted to $1,508, $1,660, and $1,934 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
Related Party Transactions
 
As described below, the Company provides services to and receives services from affiliates of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings. As many of these transactions are conducted between subsidiaries under common control of Cablevision, amounts charged for these services
may not represent amounts that might have been received or incurred if the transactions were based upon arm's length negotiations.
 
The Company distributes programming services to the pay television industry under contracts referred to as affiliation agreements. Revenues earned under affiliation agreements with companies owned by or affiliated with Cablevision for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $11,648, $10,373, and $9,260, respectively.
 
Rainbow Media Holdings pays the Company for advertising revenue earned in connection with an agreement between Rainbow Media Holdings and a third party entered into during 2000. Such revenues were $0, $170, and $170 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In addition, the Company recorded advertising revenues of $153, $121, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively from subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings. The Company incurred $369, $661, and $442 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for advertising expenses charged by subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings and Cablevision.
 
The Company provided affiliate sales support functions which primarily included salaries, facilities, and general and administrative costs, to affiliates of Rainbow Media Holdings during 2004 and 2003. These costs were recorded as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative costs and amounted to $4,914 and $2,075 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. During 2005, these support functions were consolidated at Rainbow Media Holdings and a portion was charged to the Company. These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $7,472 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
During 2005, Rainbow Media Holdings provided various public relations, acquisitions, digital media and administrative support functions which primarily included salaries, facilities, and general and administrative costs, to the Company. These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $8,048 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Prior to 2005, these costs were borne directly by the Company.
 
The Company has the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings in addition to subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings having the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and third parties. Net amounts charged to technical and operating expense of the Company under these arrangements amounted to $2,123, $2,564, and $1,770 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
Cablevision and the Company may enter into agreements with third parties in which the amounts paid/received by Cablevision or the Company may differ from the amounts that would have been paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately. Where Cablevision has incurred a cost incremental to fair value and the Company has received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations in the form of increased affiliation fee revenues, Cablevision charges the Company for the incremental amount.
In one such agreement executed in 2005, Cablevision charged the Company approximately $4,900, which was recorded as deferred carriage fees by the Company and will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the remaining license period of the affiliation agreement. Amortization of this charge amounted to $92 in 2005.
 
Rainbow Network Communications ("RNC"), a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings, provides certain transmission and production services to the Company. The Company was charged approximately $7,731, $9,069, and $8,943 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for these services. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 resulted from amounts charged by a third party directly to the Company as opposed to such cost being allocated from RNC. The Company has entered into agreements that allow RNC to continue providing these services through 2021. Future cash payments required under these agreements amount to $7,417 in 2006, $7,746 in 2007, $8,091 in 2008, $8,455 in 2009, $8,836 in 2010 and $114,612 thereafter.
 
Under contractual agreements, Cablevision provides certain management services to the Company. These agreements provide for payment, in addition to expense reimbursement, of an aggregate fee of 3.5% of AMC LLC and WE LLC's gross revenues, as defined in the management agreement. The agreements are automatically renewable every five years at the option of Cablevision. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company was charged management fees of $16,574, $15,485, and $13,114, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
 
Cablevision allocates to the Company its proportionate share of expenses or benefits related to Cablevision's employee stock plan and Cablevision's long-term incentive plan. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded a net expense of approximately $1,212, $2,447, and $4,301, respectively, for its proportionate share of the Cablevision stock plan expense and recorded an expense of $5,282, $1,527, and $1,166, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to Cablevision's long-term incentive plan. The increase in long-term incentive plan expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to grants issued in 2005. Such amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Liabilities related to the grants under the Cablevision Employee Stock Plan are funded by Rainbow Media Holdings and are reflected as capital contributions from Rainbow Media Holdings in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The long-term incentive plans are funded by the Company and liabilities of $12,599 and $7,498, related to these plans are included in accrued employee related costs and other long-term liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
NOTE 9.
BENEFIT PLANS
                                                
 
Cablevision sponsors a cash balance pension plan and a 401(k) savings plan in which certain employees of the Company participate. In connection with the cash balance plan, the Company is charged by Cablevision for credits made into an account established for each participant. Such
credits are based upon a percentage of eligible base pay and a market-based rate of return. The Company also makes matching contributions for a portion of employee voluntary contributions to the 401(k) savings plan. Total expense related to these plans was approximately $887, $851, and $1,208 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company does not provide postretirement benefits for any of its employees.
 
NOTE 10.
INCOME TAXES
                                         
 
The Company is a single-member limited liability company, wholly-owned indirectly by Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. ("RME") (a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings), a taxable corporation. As stated above, RME is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Cablevision. As such, the Company is treated as a division of RME for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, based upon the provisions of FASB No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the income tax provision is determined on a stand-alone basis as if the Company filed separate consolidated income tax returns for the periods presented herein.
 
Income tax expense of the Company consists of the following components:
 
 
The income tax expense of the Company differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the effect of the following items:
 
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:
 
Deferred tax assets have resulted from the Company's future deductible temporary differences. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of income. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for valuation allowances quarterly. As of December 31, 2005, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will fully realize the benefit associated with its gross deferred tax assets.
 
NOTE 11.
OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS
                                         
 
Off balance sheet commitments not reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 increased approximately $12,000 to approximately $237,000 as compared to approximately $225,000 outstanding at December 31, 2004. The increase in 2005 resulted primarily from the addition of future film/production obligations of approximately $47,000, future marketing commitments of $4,000, partially offset by the reduction of transmission service commitments of approximately $39,000.
 
Off balance sheet commitments
(excluding previously disclosed operating lease commitments) as of December 31, 2005 and for the ensuing calendar years are $21,287 in 2006, $17,690 in 2007, $20,203 in 2008, $22,797 in 2009, $18,908 in 2010 and $135,673 thereafter. Off balance sheet commitments consist primarily of commitments for future film/production obligations, commitments for future marketing obligations, and commitments for technical and support services with RNC.

DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Trade, Accounts Receivable-Affiliates, Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities and Accounts Payable to Affiliates
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
 
Bank Debt, Senior Notes, and Senior Subordinated Notes
 
The fair value of each of the Company's debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities.
 
The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are summarized as follows:
 
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

LEGAL MATTERS
 
The Company is party to various lawsuits, some involving substantial amounts. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Company.
 
Broadcast Music, Inc. and the American Society of Composers Matter
 
Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP"), organizations which license the performance of musical compositions of respective members, have alleged that certain of the Company's subsidiaries require a license to exhibit musical compositions in their respective catalogs. BMI and ASCAP each agreed to interim fees based on revenues covering certain periods for certain subsidiaries. These matters were submitted to a Federal Rate Court. In August 2005 certain of the Company's subsidiaries entered into blanket license agreements with ASCAP and the Federal Rate Court proceeding was discontinued with respect to ASCAP. The interim fees paid to BMI remain subject to retroactive adjustment until such time as either a final decision is made by the Court or an agreement is reached by the parties.
Accounting Related Investigations
 
The improper expense recognition matter previously reported by Cablevision has been the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing to investigate the improper expense recognition matter and Cablevision's timing of recognition of launch support, marketing and other payments under affiliation agreements.
 
NOTE 14.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
                                         
 
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments: AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE) and IFC. These reportable segments are strategic business units that are managed separately. The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment adjusted operating cash flow (defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and stock plan income or expense), a non-GAAP measure. The Company has presented the components that reconcile adjusted operating cash flow to operating income (loss), an accepted GAAP measure. Information as to the operations of the Company's business segments is set forth below.
 
 
Reconciliation (by Segment and in Total) of Adjusted Operating Cash Flow to Operating Income
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of reportable segment amounts to the Company's combined balances is as follows:
 
 
 
Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, the Company changed the presentation of intercompany balances in its segment total assets disclosures. The balance between the segment and any Cablevision subsidiary outside of the Company is evaluated individually to determine if there is a net receivable or net payable. Net receivables are included in the segments' total assets and net payables are excluded from the segments' total assets. This change had no effect on consolidated total assets at December 31, 2004 since such amounts previously were included in Intersegment eliminations.
 
 
Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company's reportable segments are attributed to or located in the United States.

OTHER MATTERS
                                         
 
On November 14, 2003, AMC LLC filed an action against Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. ("Time Warner") in New York State Supreme Court for declaratory relief and damages caused by Time Warner's anticipatory repudiation of its cable television affiliation agreement with AMC LLC. AMC LLC filed that action as a result of Time Warner's notice purporting to terminate the contract based upon Time Warner's allegation that AMC LLC had changed its programming. AMC LLC sought a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to full performance of the agreement, and, at its option, was entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages. Time Warner filed an answer and counterclaims in December 2003 seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment as to its right to terminate the affiliation agreement, an injunction requiring AMC LLC to deliver a classic films channel and damages for an alleged breach of contract. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 8, 2005, the trial court granted Time Warner's summary judgment motion as to liability (reserving the issue of damages for trial) and as to its right to a declaration that it may terminate the affiliation agreement, and the court dismissed AMC LLC's complaint. On September 29, 2005, the parties signed a settlement agreement and a stipulation discontinuing the action that was filed with the court on October 5, 2005. As part of the settlement of the Time Warner litigation with AMC LLC, Cablevision simultaneously entered into 11 separate agreements with Time Warner. These agreements included amendments and enhancements to existing affiliation agreements for some of Cablevision's programming services and new affiliation agreements and new distribution for other programming services of Cablevision. The amendments included a long-term extension of Time Warner's affiliation agreement with AMC LLC with rate and positioning terms that are favorable to AMC LLC. Because of the long-term benefits to AMC LLC from the extension and enhancement of the AMC LLC agreement, substantially all of the required payments ($74,000 is payable to Time Warner over the 2005-2007 period) attributable to AMC LLC have been capitalized as deferred carriage fees and will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the remaining 13 year life of the extended AMC LLC agreement.
On June 19, 2005, Cablevision received a proposal from the Dolan family group to acquire the outstanding, publicly-held interests in Cablevision following a pro-rata distribution to all Cablevision stockholders of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, the indirect parent of the Company (which includes Cablevision's programming operations and Madison Square Garden).  On October 24, 2005, Cablevision received a letter from the Dolan family group withdrawing the June 19, 2005 proposal to acquire the outstanding, publicly-held interests in Cablevision following a pro rata distribution of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC. In this letter, the Dolan family group also recommended that Cablevision's Board of Directors consider the declaration of a $3 billion one-time, special dividend payable pro rata to all Cablevision stockholders.
 
In December 2005, Cablevision announced that during the course of preparing for the financing of the proposed special dividend, it ascertained that there were certain technical covenant violations under the existing bank credit agreement and certain possible technical covenant violations under other debt instruments.
Cablevision immediately began the process of a comprehensive covenant compliance review, including seeking waivers under its bank credit agreement and seeking waivers under its other debt instruments, if required.
As a result of these matters, on December 18, 2005, Cablevision's Board of Directors decided not to proceed with the proposed special dividend or an announced senior note offering.
 
On January 31, 2006, Cablevision announced that it had completed the comprehensive debt covenant compliance review discussed above. See Note 6.
 
On March 5, 2006, Cablevision's Board of Directors authorized Cablevision management to take all steps that would be necessary to implement a $3 billion special dividend payable pro rata to all stockholders subject to (i) satisfying applicable legal standards, (ii) obtaining the necessary financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the Board, (iii) establishment by the Board of the record date, payment date and final dividend declaration of the special dividend in accordance with applicable New York Stock Exchange requirements and (iv) final Board approval after completion of its ongoing analysis of the proposed dividend.
 
 
During 2003, the Company wrote off approximately $8,700 of trade receivables from Adelphia Communications, which entered bankruptcy in 2002, and the related allowance following the sale of such receivables to a third party for $4,300 which was recorded in other operating income. During 2004, the Company recovered approximately $1,800 of trade receivables from a cable system operator that had previously been reserved.

Overview
 
We provide television programming to operators of cable television systems and DBS operators throughout the United States. We own three nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment programming networks:  AMC; WE: Women's Entertainment, or WE; and The Independent Film Channel, or IFC.
 
general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the effectiveness of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers.
Our future performance depends on, among other factors,
 
The second principal source of revenues is from advertising. Under our agreements with cable television system and DBS operators, we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees. This is because most of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts. Also, our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services.
We earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive affiliate fee payments from operators of cable television systems and DBS operators. These revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis and earned under multi-year contracts referred to as affiliation agreements with those operators. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks but are generally based upon the number of each affiliate's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as "viewing subscribers".  
 
We seek to grow our revenues by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable television and DBS systems that receive our programming. We refer to this as our "penetration."  AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than WE and IFC, which are not as widely distributed as AMC, a primarily analog service. WE and IFC, although carried by many of the larger distributors, have superior growth opportunities resulting from their current carriage levels with cable television operators. IFC is currently carried primarily on digital tiers while WE is carried on either analog expanded basic or digital tiers. Therefore, WE and IFC penetration rates may increase if operators are successful in converting their analog subscribers to digital tiers of service. Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements. In negotiating for increased carriage, we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers, which we record as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related subscriber guarantee, or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract
period. We may seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing and by airing an increased number of minutes of national advertising, but ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services.
 
Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would have a significant adverse impact on our business.
Our principal goals are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our services. To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality, attractive programming. Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television and DBS operators. This increased concentration enhances the power of those operators and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater ability in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements.  The Company had three customers that in the aggregate accounted for approximately 35% and 38% of the Company's consolidated net trade receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers accounted for approximately 40%, 41% and 46% of the Company's net revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
 
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments:  AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE) and IFC.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following:
 
Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets:
 
The Company's long-lived assets at December 31, 2005 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") of approximately $25.0 million, approximately $387.6 million of other intangible assets, approximately $9.3 million of property and equipment and approximately $355.7 million of long-term feature film inventory. Such assets accounted for approximately 58% of the Company's consolidated total assets.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For other long-lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.
 
such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. These valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers used to determine affiliate fee revenue, access to film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell-out rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to our long-lived assets.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any
 
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Company's reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite-lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the Company's reporting units.
 
Useful Lives of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
 
The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the July 2003 repurchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'s ("MGM") 20% interest in each of American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC"), WE: Women's Entertainment ("WE LLC") and The Independent Film Channel LLC ("IFC LLC") and the repurchase of NBC's interests in Rainbow Media Holdings LLC in various transactions in 2001 and 2002. The Company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be 10 years for affiliation agreements and 7 to 10 years for advertiser relationships. At December 31, 2005, the carrying values, net of accumulated amortization, were $322.6 million for affiliation agreements and $64.1 million for advertiser relationships.
 
The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements finite-lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and the related customer relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its major affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 10 years is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible asset.
 
There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals.
 
If an affiliate were to cease carrying a service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under "Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets" for the asset group containing that intangible. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliate agreement remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2005 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization in the year ending December 31, 2006 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $5.0 million.
 
Feature Film Inventory and Related Obligations
 
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license
period has begun unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then when the uncertainty is resolved. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight-line basis over the respective license periods.
 
The Company periodically reviews the programming usefulness of feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If it is determined that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, a write-off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films is recorded. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $17.9 million, respectively, included in technical and operating expense, representing the impairment of certain film contracts.
 
Deferred Carriage Fees
 
Deferred carriage fees represent amounts paid or payable to cable system operators to guarantee carriage of certain programming services and are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the period of the related guarantee (1 to 13 years).
 
Recent Transactions
 
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
In March 2005, $155.6 million of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC was converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
 
In August 2004, AMC LLC issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350.0 million to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution. In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC. The impact of the contribution was to reduce debt by $350.0 million and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
 
In July 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings LLC repurchased MGM's 20% interest in each of AMC LLC, WE LLC, and IFC LLC for $500.0 million.
 
Cautionary Note Concerning Historical Financial Statements
 
Investors should be aware that we are highly leveraged as a result of the financing transactions which took place in August 2004. As a result, we incur significant interest charges. These interest charges are significantly in excess of the interest expense reflected in our financial statements for periods prior to August 2004. In addition, our financial information does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial position would have been if we had operated as an entity separate from Cablevision during the periods presented.
Results of Operations
 
The following table sets forth on a historical basis certain items related to operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DATA
 
 
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2004
 
for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $34.3 million (7%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
 
The increase in net revenue from advertising for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $31.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The increase in affiliate revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year is driven by an increase at IFC of $2.9 million, partially offset by a decrease at AMC Networks of $2.3 million due to lower net effective rates.
 
Offsetting the potentially negative effects on negotiated rates for our programming services that may result from the consolidation of cable television operators and the limit on increases in the subscriber base for our substantially fully penetrated AMC programming service, the Company believes the WE and IFC programming services may benefit from increased distribution, especially on the digital tiers of cable television operators as digital capacity continues to become available; and increased advertising revenues as cable networks, including niche programming networks (such as WE and IFC), attract a greater share of
advertising spending. Changes in the viewership ratings of our AMC and WE programming services may also significantly affect future advertising revenues.
 
include primarily costs to license programming including feature films, and programming and production costs.
Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)
 
Technical and operating expenses for 2005 increased $21.6 million (15%) compared to 2004. The increase in technical and operating expense is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $20.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Of these amounts, $18.5 million is due to higher amortization of feature film inventory from increased film acquisitions at AMC Networks and IFC of $13.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively, with the remainder of the increase due to series development.
 
As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 3% in 2005 compared to 2004.
 
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $4.9 million (3%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. The net decrease is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
 
The decrease in costs associated with the investigation into improper expense recognition is driven by a decrease of $5.1 million and $0.5 million at AMC Networks and IFC, respectively, for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in other general and administrative costs is primarily driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $7.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively for 2005 compared to 2004. The increase in other general and administrative costs primarily resulted from increases in legal expenses (excluding investigation related legal expenses) of $1.6 million at AMC Networks, increases in long-term incentive plan expenses of $3.8 million ($3.6 million and $0.2 million at AMC Networks and IFC, respectively), and increases in management fees of $1.1 million at AMC Networks compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in stock plan expenses of $1.2 million is driven by a decrease at AMC Networks and IFC of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The decrease in sales and marketing costs is attributable to a decrease at AMC Networks and IFC of  $3.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, excluding the effects of stock plan expense, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2005 compared to 2004.
 
decreased $10.7 million (15%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. A decrease of approximately $8.5 million during 2005 compared to the prior year, relates to the completed amortization in July 2004 of an intangible asset that AMC Networks originally
Depreciation and amortization
recorded in 1994. Further, a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $2.2 million during 2005 compared to the prior year relates to fixed assets, of which $1.5 million relates to an AMC Networks capitalized lease asset which became full amortized in 2004.
 
increased $76.0 million during 2005 compared to 2004. The increase was attributable to $79.5 million of higher interest expense for the full year in 2005 on the notes that were issued and the bank debt that was borrowed in August 2004, partially offset by $3.5 million in increased interest income due to higher cash balances in 2005 compared to 2004.
Net interest expense
 
of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses and state taxes, partially offset by a $6.0 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in New York State tax law enacted in the second quarter of 2005.
Income tax expense
 
Income tax expense of $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, state taxes and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate.
 
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2003
 
for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $85.3 million (19%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
 
The increase in net revenue from advertising for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Networks and IFC of $45.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The increase in net affiliate revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Networks and IFC of $20.8 million and  $16.5 million, respectively.
 
include primarily costs to license programming including feature films, and programming and production costs.
Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)
 
Technical and operating expenses for 2004 increased $0.3 million (less than 1%) compared to 2003. Excluding the impact of impairment losses amounting to $0.3 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, technical and operating expenses for 2004 increased $17.9 million (14%) compared to 2003. The increase in technical and operating expense, excluding the impact of impairment losses, is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $11.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 6% in 2004 compared to 2003. Excluding the impact of impairment losses, technical and operating expenses decreased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003.
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.6 million (8%) for 2004 as compared to 2003. The net increase is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
 
The decrease in costs associated with the accounting investigation is primarily driven by a decrease of $4.7 million at AMC Networks for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in other general and administrative costs is primarily driven by an increase at AMC Networks of $10.9 million for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in other general and administrative costs primarily resulted from increases in allocations of $6.2 million ($4.8 million and $1.4 million and AMC Networks and IFC, respectively) due to the previously announced distribution of the businesses and assets of the Company as well as other businesses and assets of Cablevision to Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. ("RME") which was subsequently suspended and increases in management fees of $2.4 million at AMC Networks compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in stock plan expenses of $1.9 million is driven by a decrease at AMC Networks and IFC of $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The increase in sales and marketing costs is attributable to an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of  $3.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
 
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2004 compared to 2003.
 
of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the sale to a third party of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications which had previously been fully reserved.
Other operating income
 
increased $15.5 million (28%) for 2004 as compared to 2003. An increase of approximately $21.8 million resulted primarily from a full year of amortization of the step up in basis for intangibles acquired in July 2003 of which $21.1 million relates to AMC Networks, offset by a decrease of $6.0 million relating to the completed amortization in July 2004 of an intangible asset that AMC Networks acquired in 1994.
Depreciation and amortization
 
increased $41.5 million during 2004 compared to 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the interest expense on the notes and bank debt entered into in August 2004 described herein.
Interest income (expense), net
 
of $0.4 million in 2003 represent costs written off in connection with the termination of a credit agreement.
Write-off of deferred financing costs
decreased $17.2 million in 2004 reflecting MGM's 2003 interest in the net income of our subsidiaries. MGM's interest in those subsidiaries was acquired in July 2003, resulting in no minority interest in 2004.
Minority interests
 
of $48.7 million and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively, resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, state taxes and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate in 2004.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
The operations of the businesses that are included in our consolidated financial statements collectively have historically generated net cash flow from operations and have limited capital expenditure requirements. However, each of our programming businesses has substantial programming, acquisition and development expenditure requirements.
 
We generated net cash from operating activities during 2005 and 2004. Our cash on hand and net cash from operating activities, plus proceeds from borrowings available to the Company, will provide funding to Rainbow developing programming services, which are not subsidiaries of the Company, including the VOOM HD Networks, as well as any other general corporate purpose, subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in the Company's financing agreements.  We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of these Rainbow programming entities will be funded by distributions from the Company.
 
The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and present value of capital leases as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005:
 
 
Total amounts payable by the Company in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2005 and thereafter, including capital leases, are as follows:
 
 
Debt Financing Agreements
 
In August 2004, we issued $800.0 million of senior and senior subordinated notes and entered into a $950.0 million senior secured credit facility ($350.0 million of which is a revolving credit facility and $600.0 million of which is a term loan). Proceeds from the credit facility and the senior and senior subordinated notes amounted to approximately $1,366.3 million of which $1,366.2 million was distributed to Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, our direct parent, and recorded as a capital distribution in 2004.
 
The credit facility is a $950 million senior secured credit facility, comprised of a $600 million term loan and a $350 million revolving credit facility secured by the assets and common equity
with $350.0 million in undrawn revolver commitments.
interests of AMC LLC, IFC LLC and WE LLC and guaranteed by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, our direct parent and substantially all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company. The term loan requires quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original outstanding balance ($1.5 million) through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% of the original outstanding balance ($141.0 million) for each quarter thereafter through maturity on March 31, 2012. The revolving credit facility will be reduced quarterly commencing December 31, 2009 and through September 30, 2010, by $35.0 million, and for each quarter ending December 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011 by $52.5 million. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan were $595.5 million as of February 24, 2006,
 
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin based upon a leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Amounts outstanding under the term loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%. The interest rate under the term loan was 7.19% and 5.19% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow (as defined based on cash flows of AMC, WE, and IFC on a consolidated basis) of 6.75 times, through December 31, 2006 with periodic reductions thereafter to 5.00 times as of January 1, 2010, (ii) a maximum senior leverage ratio of senior debt (as defined) to annualized cash flow of 4.75 times through March 31, 2006 decreasing to 4.50 times through December 31, 2007, with periodic reductions thereafter to 3.50 times as of January 1, 2009, and (iii) minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense of 1.75 times and cash flow to debt service of 1.25 times through December 31, 2006 and 1.50 times for the remainder of the agreement. These covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available. Additional covenants include limitations on liens, the issuance of additional indebtedness and distributions and investments. The Company is permitted to make investments and distributions up to $200.0 million annually with a cumulative limit of $800.0 million for general discretionary purposes, and subject to having a maximum ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow of 5.0 times, distributions and investments of up to $300.0 million from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings.
 
We are also obligated to pay fees of 0.5% per annum on the undrawn revolver commitment which is recorded as interest expense.
 
The Company's notes outstanding consist of  $300 million face amount of 8-3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500 million face amount of 10-3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014.  These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries.  Principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the
indentures) of 7:1, reducing to 6:1 after January 1, 2009, limitations on dividends and distributions, investments and liens.
 
The senior notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of face value at any time on or after September 1, 2008, 102.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, and 100% on or after September 1, 2010. The senior subordinated notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 105.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, 103.458% on or after September 1, 2010, 101.729% on or after September 1, 2011, and 100% on or after September 1, 2012. The notes are redeemable at the redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.
 
In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the senior and the senior subordinated notes before September 1, 2007 at a redemption price of 108.75% and 110.375% of the principal amounts, respectively, with the net cash proceeds from specified equity offerings (as defined under the terms of the indentures) provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding immediately subsequent to the redemption.
 
Investors Service's ratings are B1 for the corporate family rating, BA3 for the senior secured bank loan, B2 for the senior unsecured debt and B3 for the senior subordinated debt and the ratings outlook is stable. Any future downgrade to the Company's credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact the Company's ability to raise additional funds.
On February 27, 2006, Standard & Poor's announced that the Company's corporate credit rating was changed to BB from BB-, the senior secured bank loan rating to BB+ from BB and the senior and senior subordinated unsecured debt to B+ from B. The ratings outlook was changed to stable from developing. Moody's
Future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by credit ratings, which are provided by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
 
No dividends were recorded prior to the recontribution and conversion.
On the date of issuance of the senior and senior subordinated notes, AMC LLC issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350.0 million to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a capital distribution. In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC. The impact of the elimination was to reduce debt by $350.0 million and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
 
Recent Events
 
Dolan Family Group Proposal
 
On June 19, 2005, Cablevision received a proposal from the Dolan family group to acquire the outstanding, publicly-held interests in Cablevision following a pro-rata distribution to all Cablevision stockholders of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, the indirect parent of the Company
(which includes Cablevision's programming operations and Madison Square Garden).  On October 24, 2005, Cablevision received a letter from the Dolan family group withdrawing the June 19, 2005 proposal to acquire the outstanding, publicly-held interests in Cablevision following a pro rata distribution of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC. In this letter, the Dolan family group also recommended that Cablevision's Board of Directors consider the declaration of a $3 billion one-time, special dividend payable pro rata to all Cablevision stockholders.
 
In December 2005, Cablevision announced that during the course of preparing for the financing of the proposed special dividend, it ascertained that there were certain technical covenant violations under its existing bank credit agreement and certain possible technical covenant violations under other debt instruments. Cablevision immediately began a comprehensive covenant compliance review, including seeking waivers under its bank credit agreement and seeking waivers under its other debt instruments, if required. As a result of these matters, on December 18, 2005, Cablevision's Board of Directors decided not to proceed with the proposed special dividend or an announced senior note offering.
 
In January, 2006, Cablevision announced that it had completed the comprehensive debt covenant compliance review discussed above. The review identified certain technical covenant compliance issues under the Company's credit facility. The Company received waivers from the lenders under the credit facility and certain technical and clarifying amendments have been made to the Company's credit facility. No fees were paid to the lenders and counterparties in connection with these waivers and amendments. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt agreements and instruments.
 
On March 5, 2006, Cablevision's Board of Directors authorized Cablevision management to take all steps that would be necessary to implement a $3 billion special dividend payable pro rata to all shareholders subject to (i) satisfying applicable legal standards, (ii) obtaining the necessary financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the Board, (iii) establishment by the Board of the record date, payment date and final dividend declaration of the special dividend in accordance with applicable New York Stock Exchange requirements and (iv) final Board approval after completion of its ongoing analysis of the proposed dividend.  If the Board of Directors of Cablevision declares a special dividend, all of the funds to pay that dividend are expected to be raised at CSC Holdings, Inc. from new bank borrowings and/or the issuance of new debt securities.
Time Warner Matter
 
On November 14, 2003, AMC LLC filed an action against Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. ("Time Warner") in New York State Supreme Court for declaratory relief and damages caused by Time Warner's anticipatory repudiation of its cable television affiliation agreement with AMC LLC. AMC LLC filed that action as a result of Time Warner's notice purporting to terminate the contract based upon Time Warner's allegation that AMC LLC had changed its programming. AMC LLC sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to full performance of the agreement, and, at its option, was entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages.  Time Warner filed an answer and counterclaims in December 2003 seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment as to its right to terminate the affiliation agreement, an injunction requiring AMC LLC to deliver a classic films channel and damages for an alleged breach of contract.  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.  On July 8, 2005, the trial court granted Time Warner's summary judgment motion as to liability (reserving the issue of damages for trial) and as to its right to a declaration that it may terminate the affiliation agreement, and the court dismissed AMC LLC's complaint.  On September 29, 2005, the parties signed a settlement agreement, and a stipulation discontinuing the action was filed with the court on October 5, 2005.  As part of the settlement of the Time Warner litigation with AMC LLC, Cablevision simultaneously entered into 11 separate agreements with Time Warner.  These agreements included amendments and enhancements to existing affiliation agreements for some of Cablevision's programming services and new affiliation agreements and new distribution for other programming services of Cablevision.  The amendments included a long-term extension of Time Warner's affiliation agreement with AMC LLC with rate and positioning terms that are favorable to AMC LLC.  Because of the long-term benefits to AMC LLC from the extension and enhancement of the AMC LLC agreement, substantially all of the required payments ($74 million is payable to Time Warner over the 2005-2007 period) attributable to AMC LLC have been capitalized as deferred carriage fees and will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the remaining 13 year life of the extended AMC LLC agreement.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
 
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. Statement No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Statement No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Statement No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date in which the excess tax deductions result in a reduction of income taxes payable. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107 regarding the SEC's interpretation of Statement No. 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies.
 
Cablevision will adopt Statement No. 123R on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application. The modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of the restricted share awards, stock option awards and stock appreciation rights outstanding at December 31, 2005, over the remaining service periods related to such awards. Cablevision will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments. In accordance with the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Cablevision recognized the majority of the share-based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method. Subsequent to January 1, 2006, Cablevision will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated recognition method and will recognize the cost for new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Cablevision has not quantified the impact of adopting Statement No. 123R which will in turn affect the amount that Cablevision allocates to the Company.
 
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Statement No. 153 addresses the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Statement No. 153 eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Previously, APB Opinion No. 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. The Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of the provisions of Statement No. 153 for all nonmonetary exchanges initiated after July 1, 2005 had no impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. The FASB issued FIN No. 47 to address diverse accounting practices that developed with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset when the timing and (or) method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event. FIN No. 47 concludes that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 became effective for the Company on December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 had no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
 
In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Statement No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. Statement No. 154 requires that a
change in method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle. Statement No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
