Exhibit 99.1
 
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Bethpage, N.Y., May 9, 2006
Consolidated net revenue grew 16.2% to more than $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong revenue growth in Telecommunications Services; Madison Square Garden; and the AMC, IFC and WE networks, offset in part by lower revenue in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses. Operating income grew 37.6% to $103.1 million and adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")* increased 12.1% to $396.4 million.
Highlights for the first quarter include:
Record quarterly Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") growth of nearly 450,000 new video, high-speed data and voice units
                 
Eighth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains; highest quarterly net gain since 2000
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 17.1% and AOCF growth of 18.1% as compared to Q1 2005
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $104.24 in Q1 2006
                 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision enjoyed an excellent first quarter, driven largely by the continued industry-leading success of our consumer video, voice and data services. In addition to double-digit increases in consolidated revenue and adjusted operating cash flow, Cablevision experienced its highest quarterly gain in basic video subscribers since 2000, while achieving record quarterly gains in both high-speed data and voice customers. These results, along with the addition of nearly 165,000 digital video customers, ensured Cablevision's industry-leading penetration rates for all of its consumer services for yet another quarter," concluded Mr. Dolan.
Results from Continuing Operations

*
Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits. Please refer to page 4 for a discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the first quarter rose 16.7% to $993.3 million, operating income increased 35.2% to $151.1 million, and AOCF grew 17.3% to $381.6 million, all as compared to the prior year period.
Cable Television 
Cable Television first quarter net revenues increased 17.1% to $952.7 million, operating income increased 31.1% to $157.9 million and AOCF rose 18.1% to $367.6 million, each compared to the prior year period. The increases in revenue, operating income, and AOCF resulted principally from growth in video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the addition of more than 1.45 million Revenue Generating Units since the first quarter of 2005.
Highlights include:
customers up 38,722 or 1.3% from December 2005 and 80,915 or 2.7% from March 2005; eighth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains
                 
Basic video
customers up 164,659 or 8.4% from December 2005 and 504,297 or 31.1% from March 2005
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 112,289 or 6.6% from December 2005 and 366,044 or 25.4% from March 2005
                 
Optimum Online
high-speed data
customers up 133,967 or 18.3% from December 2005 and 500,828 or 137.4% from March 2005
                 
Optimum Voice
up 449,078 or 6.0% from December 2005 and 1,450,333 or 22.6% from March 2005
                 
Revenue Generating Units
revenue down 2.7% from the prior year period
                 
Advertising
of $104.24, up $3.78 or 3.8% for the quarter and $13.06 or 14.3% from Q1 2005
                 
Cable
Television RPS
of 38.6% compared to 38.3% in Q1 2005 and 39.8% in Q4 2005
                 
AOCF margin
Lightpath
For the first quarter, Lightpath net revenues increased 13.0% to $54.0 million, operating loss declined 21.8% to $6.8 million and AOCF declined 0.5% to $14.0 million, each as compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to revenue growth in Ethernet data services over Lightpath's fiber infrastructure, offset in part by a decline in traditional phone service usage. Operating loss and AOCF results
reflect revenue growth offset by increased quarterly expenses, as compared to the prior year period, including an increase in marketing spending related to growth
initiatives. In addition, the decline in operating loss was impacted by lower depreciation and amortization in the current quarter compared to the prior year period. Lightpath revenue also includes Optimum Voice call completion activity, which has no net impact on operating loss or AOCF. Lightpath revenue excluding Optimum Voice call activity would have increased 6.3%.
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our AMC, IFC and WE: Women's Entertainment national programming services as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Bay Area, FSN Chicago, fuse, Mag Rack, Sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow developmental ventures.
Rainbow net revenues for the first quarter increased 2.9% to $206.3 million, operating income declined $9.7 million to an operating loss of $5.0 million and AOCF declined 31.6% to $26.9 million all compared to the prior year period.
AMC/IFC/WE
First quarter net revenues increased 7.8% to $145.5 million, operating income declined 14.3% to $40.9 million and AOCF declined 6.9% to $58.8 million, each compared to the prior year period.

The first quarter results reflect:
A 16.9% increase in advertising revenue driven by higher primetime sellout rates
                 
A 3.7% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 7.6% at IFC, 1.5% at WE and 1.2% at AMC as compared to March 2005
                 
Higher contractual rights expense, other programming costs and marketing expenditures related to the premiere of new original programming
                 
Other
Programming
First quarter net revenues declined 7.2% to $67.1 million, operating loss increased 6.6% to $45.9 million, and the AOCF deficit increased $8.1 million to $31.9 million, all as compared to the prior year period. The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by the closure of two Metro Channels in 2005, partially offset by higher revenue at fuse and the regional sports and news networks. The increases in operating loss and AOCF deficit are primarily driven by the net revenue losses described above and higher expenses associated with the launch of new regional news networks in late 2005.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.
Madison Square Garden's first quarter net revenue increased 24.7% to $223.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2005. Operating loss increased 3.7% to $12.4 million and AOCF increased to $6.9 million from $3.3 million, both compared to the prior year period. MSG's first quarter results were primarily impacted by:
An increase in revenue and expense relating to the impact of the 2005/2006 hockey season as compared to the NHL lock-out the prior year
                 
Higher network affiliate revenue for Q1 2006 compared to Q1 2005
                 
NBA luxury tax expense in Q1 2006 compared to no luxury tax in Q1 2005
                 
The loss of revenue and the reduction in rights expense associated with the termination of the New York Mets carriage agreement
                 
Total Company (Results from Continuing Operations)
Consolidated results exclude FSN Ohio, FSN Florida, and Rainbow DBS's distribution operations, which are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Consolidated first quarter 2006 results compared to the prior year period are as follows:
Consolidated net revenue grew 16.2% to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period, driven by the addition of over 1.45 million Revenue Generating Units since Q1 2005 in Cable Television, combined with revenue growth at Madison Square Garden and the AMC, IFC and WE networks, offset in part by lower revenues in Rainbow's Other Programming businesses, primarily from the closure of the two Metro Channels.
                 
Operating income increased 37.6% to $103.1 million and consolidated AOCF increased 12.1% to $396.4 million. The increases in operating income and AOCF reflect the net growth in revenue discussed above, partially offset by lower AOCF in the Rainbow segment.

2006 Outlook
The company affirms and updates the previously issued full year 2006 guidance as outlined in the table below:
 
 
Percentage growth
(a)
         
The company's definition of AOCF excludes charges or credits related to our employee stock plan and non-employee director stock plan, including those related to restricted shares, stock options and stock appreciation rights; therefore, the 2006 outlook above excludes any impact of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R (effective January 1, 2006).
(b)
        
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding charges or credits related to our employee and non-employee director stock plans and restructuring charges or credits. Because it is based upon operating income/(loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. We believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense  allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights (for the 2005 period) or stock appreciation rights (for the 2006 period) and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that will not be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure. We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis. AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies. For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Statement of Cash Flows. Net cash from operating activities also excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations. We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities. We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt service and other discretionary and non-discretionary items. It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

The following is a description of the adjustments to operating income included in this earnings release:
.   For the 2006 period, this adjustment eliminates the compensation cost relating to stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock granted under our employee stock plan and non-employee director plan which has been recorded pursuant to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R. For the 2005 period, this adjustment eliminates the benefit or expense associated with vesting and marking to market of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights and charges related to the issuance of restricted stock.
                 
Stock plan benefit (expense)
   This adjustment eliminates the charges or credits associated with costs related to the elimination of positions, facility realignment, and other related restructuring activities in all periods.
                 
Restructuring credits (charges).
  
                 
Depreciation and amortization (including impairments)
