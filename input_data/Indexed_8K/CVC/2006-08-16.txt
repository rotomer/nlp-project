Item 8.01    Other Events.
Option and SAR Matters
        On August 8, 2006, Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") and CSC Holdings, Inc. filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that as a result of a voluntary, ongoing review they had determined that the date and exercise price assigned to a number of its stock options and SAR grants during the 1997-2002 period did not correspond to the actual grant date and the closing price of the Company's common stock on that day.
        Shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, by parties identifying themselves as shareholders of the Company purporting to act on behalf of the Company against certain present and former members of the Company's Board of Directors and certain present and former executive officers. These lawsuits allege breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment relating to practices with respect to the dating of stock options, recordation and accounting for stock options, and financial statements and SEC filings. The lawsuits seek damages from all defendants and disgorgement from the officer defendants.
        There may be additional lawsuits filed, including purported class actions and additional derivative actions, in federal or state court, which are based upon allegations substantially similar to those described above or otherwise involving options related matters. The Company does not intend to file further Current Reports on Form 8-K describing the filing of any such additional lawsuits.
        As noted in the Company's August 8, 2006 Form 8-K, the Company contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York concerning the option and SAR review. The Company has since been informed that the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office are each conducting an investigation into these matters. The Company intends to fully cooperate with these investigations.
Pending Exchange Offer
         CSC Holdings, Inc., due to the matters discussed in the August 8, 2006 Form 8-K referenced above, announced on August 16, 2006 that it would extend until September 8, 2006, at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, its offer to exchange up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 6-3/4% Senior Notes due 2012, which were initially issued and sold in a private placement in April 2004, for an equal aggregate amount of its registered 6-3/4% Senior Notes due 2012. Except for the extension of the expiration date, all of the other terms of the exchange offer remain as set forth in the exchange offer prospectus dated July 18, 2006.
RNS Financial Information
        On August 13, 2006, the Company's subsidiary, Rainbow National Services LLC ("RNS"), advised the trustee for its outstanding notes that, in light of the option and SAR review disclosed in the Company's August 8, 2006 Form 8-K, RNS would not deliver financial information under the RNS indentures by August 14, 2006 but expected to be able to deliver that information by August 21, 2006.
