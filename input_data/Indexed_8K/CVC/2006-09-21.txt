Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported complete financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006.  On August 8, 2006, the Company released select second quarter operating and financial measures, citing an expected restatement of financial statements for periods prior to its second quarter of 2006.  Today the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005 and a Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 with restated financial statements, as well as its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.  The financial information in this release reflects the restated financial information in those reports, where applicable.
Bethpage, N.Y., September 21, 2006
 increased 17.5% to $469.9 million.  These results include the impact of certain items in both Cable Television and at Rainbow that are described on page 2 and page 3, respectively.  Excluding the impact of these items, the company's second quarter net revenue, operating income, and AOCF would have increased 15.0%, 38.5% and 9.2%, respectively.
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter of 2006 grew 15.6% to more than $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and Madison Square Garden.  Operating income grew 75.1% to $166.5 million and adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")
(1)
Operating highlights for the second quarter 2006 include:
Quarterly Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") growth of more than 385,000 new video, high-speed data and voice units; the Company's highest second quarter RGU gain ever
                 
Ninth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 17.9% as compared to the second quarter of 2005
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $109.01
                 
Results from Continuing Operations

Segment results for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 are as follows:
 
(1).
Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding stock plan charges or credits and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 5 for a more detailed definition of AOCF and discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the second quarter 2006 rose 17.2% to $1,049.1 million, operating income increased 52.7% to $198.2 million, and AOCF grew 24.0% to $439.1 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Second quarter 2006 operating income and AOCF include a reduction in technical and operating expenses of $26.5 million relating to the resolution of a contractual programming dispute.  Excluding this item, second quarter operating income and AOCF would have increased 32.1% and 16.4%, respectively.
Cable Television
Cable Television second quarter 2006 net revenues increased 17.9% to $1,008.4 million, operating income increased 48.1% to $202.8 million and AOCF rose 25.4% to $423.1 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The increases in net revenue, operating income, and AOCF resulted principally from growth in video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the addition of more than 1.5 million Revenue Generating Units since the second quarter of 2005.  Second quarter 2006 Cable Television results include the item discussed above.  Excluding this item, second quarter operating income and AOCF would have increased 28.6% and 17.5%, respectively.
Second quarter 2006 highlights include:
customers up 35,328 or 1.2% from March 2006 and 95,486 or 3.2% from June 2005; ninth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains
                 
Basic video
customers up 143,499 or 6.7% from March 2006 and 529,265  or 30.4% from June 2005
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum digital video
customers up 84,819 or 4.7% from March 2006 and 371,578 or 24.4% from June 2005
                 
Optimum Online high-speed data
customers up 122,234 or 14.1% from March 2006 and 509,185 or 106.4% from June 2005
                 
Optimum Voice
up 385,284 or 4.9% from March 2006 and 1,503,577 or 22.3% from June 2005
                 
Revenue Generating Units
revenue rose 22.6% from March 2006 and declined 1.0% from the prior year period
                 
Advertising
of $109.01, up $4.77 or 4.6% from the first quarter of 2006 and $13.79 or 14.5% from the second quarter of 2005
                 
Cable Television RPS
of 42.0% (39.3% excluding the benefit of the dispute resolution discussed above) compared to 38.6% in the first quarter of 2006 and 39.4% in the second quarter of 2005
                 
AOCF margin
For the second quarter 2006, Lightpath net revenues increased 11.3% to $52.9 million, operating loss declined 35.2% to $4.6 million and AOCF declined 5.5% to $16.0 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue is primarily attributable to growth in Optimum Voice call completion activity and Ethernet data services over Lightpath's fiber infrastructure, offset in part by a decline in traditional phone service usage.  Second quarter 2006 operating loss and AOCF results reflect revenue growth and a credit to carrier costs, offset by increased marketing and network expenses, as compared to the prior year period.  In addition, the decline in operating loss was primarily impacted by lower depreciation and amortization in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the prior year period.  Revenue related to Optimum Voice call completion activity has no net impact on operating loss or AOCF.  Lightpath revenue excluding Optimum Voice call activity would have increased 1.0%.
Lightpath
Rainbow consists of our National Programming services - AMC, IFC and WE tv (formerly known as WE: Women's Entertainment) as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Bay Area, fuse, MagRack, sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network

Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.  After the resolution of a contractual dispute with one of its major affiliates, the operations of FSN Chicago were shut down in June 2006.
Rainbow net revenues for the second quarter 2006 increased 10.7% to $225.9 million, operating loss declined 84.5% to $1.7 million and AOCF rose 11.0% to $32.5 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Second quarter 2005 results exclude certain affiliate revenue attributable to the quarter that was not recognized, due to a contractual dispute, until the third quarter of 2005 when such dispute was resolved.  If this net revenue had been recognized in the second quarter of 2005, second quarter 2006 net revenue would have increased 7.5% while operating loss and AOCF would have declined 66.4% and 7.5%, respectively.
Second quarter 2006 net revenues increased 12.0% to $151.7 million, operating income rose 20.3% to $39.3 million and AOCF rose 15.5% to $57.6 million, each compared to the prior year period.  As noted above, second quarter 2005 results exclude certain affiliate revenue, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2005.  If this revenue had been recognized in the second quarter of 2005, AMC/IFC/WE's second quarter 2006 net revenue, operating income, and AOCF would have increased 7.2%, 2.0% and 3.4%, respectively.
AMC/IFC/WE
The second quarter 2006 results reflect:
A 13.8% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher primetime sellout rates
                 
A 9.9% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period or a 2.7% increase if the disputed affiliate revenue described above were included in the second quarter of 2005
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 7.7% at IFC, 5.0% at WE and 1.7% at AMC as compared to June 2005
                 
Higher contractual rights expense and marketing expenditures related to the premiere of new original programming
                 
Second quarter 2006 net revenues rose 4.9% to $79.9 million, operating loss declined 5.8% to $41.0 million, and the AOCF deficit increased $4.5 million to $25.1 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher revenue at the regional sports and news networks, IFC Entertainment and fuse, partially offset by the impact of the closure of two Metro Channels in 2005.  The increase in AOCF deficit is primarily driven by operating losses at VOOM HD Networks, regional news networks, fuse and the 2005 closure of the Metro Channels, offset by a reduction in expenses at IFC Entertainment and the growth in revenue discussed above.
Other Programming
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex and Radio City Music Hall.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's second quarter 2006 net revenue increased 6.9% to $162.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2005.  Second quarter 2006 operating income declined $8.0 million to an operating loss of $0.4 million and AOCF declined to $18.0 million from $29.8 million, both compared to the prior year period.  MSG's second quarter 2006 results were primarily impacted by:
Higher network affiliate revenue, as compared to the second quarter of 2005, despite certain retroactive rate adjustments in the second quarter of 2005
                 
A net increase in revenue and a net decline in AOCF resulting from the return of NHL games after the cancellation of the 2004-2005 hockey season and the termination of the New York Mets broadcast rights agreement
                 
Higher Knicks player related costs in the second quarter of 2006 including luxury tax expense

Consolidated second quarter 2006 results are as follows:
Total Company (Results from Continuing Operations)
Consolidated net revenue grew 15.6% to more than $1.4 billion, compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by the addition of more than 1.5 million Revenue Generating Units since the second quarter of 2005 in Cable Television, combined with revenue growth at all other reportable segments.
                 
Operating income increased 75.1% to $166.5 million and consolidated AOCF increased 17.5% to $469.9 million, compared to the second quarter of 2005.  The increases in operating income and AOCF reflect the net growth in revenue discussed above, partially offset by higher expenses at MSG, Rainbow's Other Programming and other corporate G&A expense.
                 
Total company results were impacted by certain events in both the second quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2005 as described above.  Excluding these items, the company's second quarter net revenue, operating income, and AOCF would have increased 15.0%, 38.5% and 9.2%, respectively.
                 
In addition, in April 2006 the Company paid a $10 per share special cash dividend (a total of approximately $2.96 billion) funded by approximately $3 billion of additional debt.  Second quarter 2006 total net interest expense reflects a significant increase, as compared to the prior year period, principally as a result of the additional borrowing.
2006 Outlook
The company affirms and updates the previously issued full year 2006 guidance as outlined below:
 
Percentage growth rate (2006 as compared to 2005)
(a)
            
The company's definition of AOCF excludes charges or credits related to our employee stock plan and non-employee director stock plan, including those related to restricted shares, stock options and stock appreciation rights; therefore, the 2006 outlook above excludes any impact of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R (effective January 1, 2006).
(b)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding charges or credits related to our employee and non-employee director stock plans and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights (for the 2005 period) or stock appreciation rights (for the 2006 period) and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities also excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt service and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (Dollars in thousands) (Unaudited)
 
Excludes the capital expenditures of FSN Ohio, FSN Florida, FSN Chicago and Rainbow DBS (distribution operations), which are reported as discontinued operations.
(a)
         
The increase in second quarter 2006 capital expenditures, as compared to the prior year period, principally relates to consumer premise equipment spending, which is primarily the result of growth in Revenue Generating Units, offset in part by a decline in support capital expenditures.
(b)
        
The increase in capital expenditures for the six-month period ending June 30, 2006, as compared to the prior year period, is principally related to increases in consumer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure spending.  The consumer premise equipment spending primarily relates to Revenue Generating Unit growth.  The increase in scalable infrastructure spending primarily relates to an increase in speed to 15-megabits for the core Optimum Online service and the introduction of the 30-megabit Optimum Online Boost premium service.
