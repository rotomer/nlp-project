NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in thousands)
(unaudited)
NOTE 1.                BUSINESS
In July 2004, Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") formed Rainbow National Services LLC (the "Company").  Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Cablevision, owns 100% of the membership interests in the Company.  The Company is a holding company with no independent operations.  Its subsidiaries include entities that principally own nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment services operated as integral parts of Cablevision, including AMC, WE tv (formerly WE: Women's Entertainment) and IFC.  The Company's consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations.  The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company could differ from those that might have resulted had the Company been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
NOTE 2.                BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information as required by the Company's indentures even though the Company is not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and notes required for complete annual financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2006 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 presented herein are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, such consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year ending December 31, 2006.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2005.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Advertising revenue is recognized when commercials are aired in accordance with the broadcast year which ends on the last Sunday on or prior to the last day of each quarter.  The nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 each include 39 weeks and the 2005 broadcast year
6
included 52 weeks.  In 2006, the broadcast year will include 53 weeks and the fourth quarter of 2006 will include 14 weeks.
Comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 equals net income for the respective periods.
NOTE 3.                CASH FLOWS
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company's non-cash investing and financing activities and other supplemental data were as follows:
 
In March 2005, $155,567 of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, the Company's indirect parent, were converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
In August 2004, American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the contribution was to reduce debt by $350,000 and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
NOTE 4.                RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 ("Statement No. 154").  Statement No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in
7
accounting principle unless it is impracticable.  APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 requires that a change in method of calculating depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle.  APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 was effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made by the Company beginning January 1, 2006.
Cablevision adopted FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method.   The modified prospective method requires that share-based compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of restricted share awards and stock option awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 over the remaining service periods related to such awards, after adjustment for estimated forfeitures, and the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods are not restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of Statement No. 123R.  Cablevision will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments.  In accordance with the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Cablevision recognized the majority of the share-based compensation costs using the accelerated attribution method.  Subsequent to January 1, 2006, Cablevision will continue to recognize the cost for previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated attribution method and will recognize the compensation expense for new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  In connection with Cablevision's adoption of Statement No. 123R, the Company recorded an allocated expense of $121 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes of $72, in the Company's consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Share-based compensation expense allocated to the Company by Cablevision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 (excluding the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes discussed above) and 2005 was $2,324 and $7,843, respectively, and $1,010 and $3,057, respectively, and has been recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense and as a capital contribution.
NOTE 5.                INCOME TAXES
the income tax provision is determined on a stand-alone basis as if the Company filed separate consolidated income tax returns for the periods presented herein.
The Company is a single-member limited liability company, indirectly wholly-owned by Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. ("RME"), a taxable corporation.  RME is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision.  As such, the Company is treated as a division of RME and is included in the consolidated income tax return of Cablevision for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, based upon the provisions of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
state income taxes and non-deductible
The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 of $13,546 and $11,980, respectively, differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the impact of
8
expenses, and for 2005, a $6,014 deferred tax benefit resulting from a New York state tax law enacted in the second quarter of 2005.
Since there is no tax sharing agreement in place between the Company and Cablevision, allocable current income tax liabilities calculated on a separate company basis that the Company did not pay directly have been reflected as deemed capital contributions to the Company from its parent.  Such contributions amounted to $21,004 and $22,167 for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
NOTE 6.                INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The following table summarizes information relating to the Company's acquired intangible assets at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005:

NOTE 7.                LEASES
The Company leases equipment (primarily satellite equipment) under capital leases, which expire in 2006 and 2019.  At September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the gross amount of equipment and related accumulated depreciation recorded under these leases were as follows:
 
Future minimum capital lease payments as of September 30, 2006 are as follows:
 
NOTE 8.                SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments: AMC Networks (which includes AMC and WE tv) and IFC.  These reportable segments are strategic business units that are managed separately.  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment adjusted operating cash flow (defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits), a non-GAAP measure.  The Company has presented the components that reconcile adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, an accepted GAAP measure, as well as information as to the operations of the Company's business segments below.
 
10
Reconciliation (by Segment and in Total) of Adjusted Operating Cash Flow to Operating Income
 
 
 
 
11
A reconciliation of reportable segment amounts to the Company's consolidated balances is as follows:
 
 
 
Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company's reportable segments are attributed to or located in the United States.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.  Cash is invested in bank time deposits offered by financial institutions that have received the highest rating awarded by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.  The Company had three customers that in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38% and 35% of the Company's consolidated net
12
trade receivable balances at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers accounted for approximately 39% and 40% of the Company's net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
NOTE 9.                LEGAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to various claims in the ordinary course of business.  Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the Company.
Broadcast Music, Inc. Matter
Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI"), an organization that licenses the performance of musical compositions of respective members, has alleged that certain of the Company's subsidiaries require a license to exhibit musical compositions in their respective catalogs. BMI agreed to interim fees based on revenues covering certain periods for certain subsidiaries. These matters were submitted to a Federal Rate Court.  The interim fees paid to BMI remain subject to retroactive adjustment until such time as either a final decision is made by the Court or an agreement is reached by the parties.
Accounting Related Investigations
The improper expense recognition matter previously reported by Cablevision has been the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing to investigate the improper expense recognition matter and Cablevision's timing of recognition of launch support, marketing and other payments under affiliation agreements.
Stock Option Related Matters
Cablevision and CSC announced on August 8, 2006 that, based on a voluntary review of past practices in connection with grants of stock options and SARs, they had determined that the grant date and exercise price assigned to a number of their stock option and SAR grants during the 1997-2002 period did not correspond to the actual grant date and the fair market value of Cablevision's common stock on the actual grant date.  The review was conducted with a law firm that was not previously involved with the Cablevision stock option plans.  Cablevision and CSC have advised the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York of these matters and each has commenced an investigation.  Cablevision and CSC have received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York seeking documents related to the stock option issues. Cablevision and CSC have also received a document request from the SEC relating to its informal investigation into these matters.  Cablevision and CSC continue to fully cooperate with such government investigations.
NOTE 10.
DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                                         
The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are summarized as follows:
 
13
 
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
NOTE 11. 
DEBT
                                   
On July 5, 2006, the Company entered into a replacement bank facility providing for an $800,000 senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), which consists of a $500,000 term A loan facility and a $300,000 revolving credit facility which was used primarily to refinance its then existing credit facility.  The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012.  The Credit Agreement allows the Company to utilize up to $50,000 of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5,000 for a swing loan.  Further, the Credit Agreement provides for an incremental facility of up to $925,000, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100,000.  If an incremental facility is established, the Company and the lenders will enter into a supplement to the Credit Agreement with terms and conditions that are no more restrictive than those in the Credit Agreement.  There are no commitments from the lenders to fund an incremental facility.
On July 5, 2006, the Company borrowed the entire $500,000 term A loan and $10,000 under the revolving credit facility. The Company used the $510,000 borrowed under the Credit Agreement and $88,048 of additional available cash to repay all of its outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due under its August 2004 $950,000 senior secured credit facility of which $592,500 was outstanding under a term loan at July 5, 2006 (scheduled to mature March 31, 2012) and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement. The Company may use future borrowings under the Credit Agreement to make investments, distributions and other payments permitted under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid without penalty at any time.  At September 30, 2006, $500,000 was outstanding under the term A loan and $38,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  The Company had $262,000 in undrawn revolver commitments at September 30, 2006.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are direct obligations of the Company which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of its subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, the direct parent of the Company, and are secured by the pledge of the stock of the Company and the stock of substantially all of its subsidiaries and all of the other assets of the Company and substantially all of its subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate under
14
the Credit Agreement varies, depending on the Company's cash flow ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), from 1.0% to 1.5% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar-based borrowings and from zero to 0.5% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings. On September 30, 2006, the interest rate on the term A loan facility and the revolving credit facility was 6.76% and 6.66%, respectively.  The $500,000 term A loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original outstanding balance ($6,250) from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2010, 2.5% of the original outstanding balance ($12,500) from March 31, 2011 until December 31, 2012, and 32.5% of the original outstanding balance ($162,500) on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the term A loan maturity date.  Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012.
The financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 1.75 to 1.00, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 6.75 to 1.00 through June 30, 2008, decreasing thereafter to 6.25 to 1.00, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.00.  Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates.
The Company is obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn revolver commitment.
In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into in July 2006, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $5,369 which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.  The Company recorded $6,084 as a write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the August 2004 credit facility in July 2006.
NOTE 12.              SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On October 8, 2006, Cablevision received a proposal from the Dolan Family Group (the "Dolan Family Group Proposal") to acquire, at a purchase price of $27.00 per share in cash, all of the outstanding shares of Cablevision's common stock, except for the shares held by the Dolan Family Group.  The Dolan Family Group Proposal contemplates that substantially all of the purchase price would be funded by the incurrence of additional indebtedness by Cablevision, CSC Holdings, the Company and several other subsidiaries of Cablevision and CSC Holdings.
Cablevision's Board of Directors appointed a special transaction committee of independent directors, which consists of Thomas V. Reifenheiser and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan USN (Ret.), to review the proposal. The special transaction committee has retained Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as its legal counsel, and Lehman Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors

Stock Option Review
On August 8, 2006, Cablevision and CSC announced that in light of published reports concerning the pricing of stock options and the timing of option grants at numerous other companies, they had undertaken a voluntary review of their past practices in connection with grants of stock options and SARs.   As a result of the review which was conducted with a law firm that was not previously involved with Cablevision's stock option plans, Cablevision and CSC determined that the grant date and exercise price assigned to a number of their stock option and SAR grants during the 1997-2002 period did not correspond to the actual grant date and the fair market value of Cablevision's common stock on the actual grant date.  Cablevision and CSC have restated their financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, all quarterly periods in 2005 and 2004 and the quarter ended March 31, 2006 to adjust previously recognized amounts of non-cash stock based compensation expense resulting from their stock option review.
Although Cablevision and CSC restated their previously issued financial statements, the Company concluded that any adjustment amounts that were attributable to the Company were not material to the Company.  Therefore, the Company has not restated any of its previously issued financial statements and, accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the matters covered by the stock option review.
As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the stock option matters are the subject of ongoing government investigations, as well as litigation.  Cablevision and CSC continue to fully cooperate with such government investigations.
Overview
We provide television programming to cable television systems and DBS operators throughout the United States.  We own three nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment programming networks:  AMC; WE tv (formerly known as WE: Women's Entertainment), and IFC.
general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers.
Our future performance depends on, among other factors,
We earn revenues in two principal ways.  First, we receive affiliate fee payments from cable television systems and DBS operators.  These revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis
2
and earned under multi-year contracts with those operators referred to as affiliation agreements. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks but are generally based upon the number of each operator's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as "viewing subscribers."  The second principal source of revenues is from advertising.  Under our agreements with cable television system and DBS operators, we have the right to sell a specific amount of national advertising time on our programming networks.  Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees because most of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts.  Also, our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services.
We seek to grow our revenues by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of viewing subscribers.  We refer to this as our "penetration."  AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than WE tv and IFC, which are not as widely distributed as AMC, a primarily analog service.  WE tv and IFC, although carried by many of the larger distributors, have higher growth opportunities due to their current penetration levels with cable television operators.  IFC is currently carried primarily on digital tiers, while WE tv is carried on either analog expanded basic or digital tiers.  Therefore, WE tv and IFC penetration rates may increase if operators are successful in converting their analog subscribers to digital tiers of service.  Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements.  In negotiating for increased carriage, we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers, which we record as deferred carriage fees that are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related subscriber guarantee, or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.  We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the number of minutes of national advertising and by increasing rates for such advertising, but ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services.
Our principal goals are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our services.  To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality, attractive programming.  Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television systems and DBS operators.  This increased concentration enhances the power of those operators and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration.  In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of affiliation agreements.  The Company had three customers that in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38% and 35% of the Company's consolidated net trade receivable balances at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers accounted for approximately 39% and 40% of the Company's net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliates would have a significant adverse impact on our business.

The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments:  AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE tv) and IFC.
Certain Transactions
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In March 2005, $155.6 million of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC was converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
In August 2004, American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350.0 million to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the elimination was to reduce debt by $350.0 million and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
Cautionary Note Concerning Historical Financial Statements
Investors should be aware that we are highly leveraged.  As a result, we incur significant interest charges.  In addition, our financial information does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial position would have been if we had operated as an entity separate from Cablevision, our indirect parent, during the periods presented herein.

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 Versus the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 increased $0.2 million (less than 1%) and $26.9 million (6%) respectively, as compared to revenues for the same period in the prior year.  The net increases are attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
The increase in advertising revenue, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same periods in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Networks and IFC of $6.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and $18.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively.   The increase in advertising revenue, net at AMC Networks resulted principally from higher primetime sellout rates.  The increase at IFC is due to increased event sponsorship sales related to programming aired on the network.  The change in affiliate revenue, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by increases at AMC Networks and IFC of $2.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively, primarily due to an increase in viewing subscribers and rate changes.  Viewing subscribers as of September 30, 2006 compared to September 30, 2005, increased 7.1% and 4.6% at IFC and AMC Networks, respectively. 2.3% of the AMC Networks increase relates to the addition of Canadian viewing subscribers for the broadcast of AMC, which launched in September 2006.
The Company believes the WE tv and IFC programming services may benefit from increased distribution, especially on the digital tiers of cable television operators as digital capacity continues to become available; and increased advertising revenues as cable networks, including ad-supported niche programming networks (such as WE tv), attract a greater advertising market share.  These increases could potentially be offset by lower net effective rates for our programming services due to the consolidation of cable television operators and limited opportunities for increases in distribution for our substantially fully penetrated AMC programming service.  Changes in the viewership ratings of our AMC and WE tv programming services may also significantly affect future advertising revenues.
Our advertising revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same periods in the prior year and we expect this trend to continue throughout the remainder of 2006.
primarily include amortization of costs to license programming, including feature films, and programming and production costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense of fixed assets and definite lived intangibles is not included in technical and operating expenses but is presented as a separate operating expense.
Technical and operating expenses
7
Technical and operating expenses decreased $2.9 million (7%) for the three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 and increased $12.5 million (10%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.  As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased to 28% for the three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to 31% for the same period in the prior year and increased to 30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to 29% for the same period in 2005. The decrease in technical and operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2006 as compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by a decrease at AMC Networks and IFC of $1.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  The decrease at AMC Networks is due to lower amortization of licensed programming content.  The decrease at IFC is due to the timing of expenses related to original programming.  The increase in technical and operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 as compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $10.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  The increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2006 is primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million of expenses related to original productions at AMC Networks.  The increase at IFC is primarily related to higher amortization of licensed programming content.
There may be significant changes in the level of our expenses from quarter to quarter due to content acquisitions and/or program development activities.  As additional competition for product increases from new programming services and alternate distribution technologies continue to develop in the industry, costs for film and other programming content may increase.
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of office facilities.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.4 million (10%) and $14.5 million (13%), respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 as compared to the same periods in 2005.    As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 25% for the three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to 23% for the same period in 2005 and increased to 29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to 28% for the same period in 2005.  The increase is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
The net increase in selling and marketing costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same periods in the prior year is attributable to a decrease at AMC Networks of $1.4 million, offset by an increase at IFC of $1.4 million, and an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of  $3.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively.  The increase at AMC Networks for the nine month period ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to marketing and promotion associated with the premiere
8
of new original programming during the period.  The increase in long-term incentive plan expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year is attributable to an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $2.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year  (includes the effects of Cablevision's adoption of Statement No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in the three month period ended March 31, 2006) is driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $1.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.  The increase in other general and administrative costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same periods in the prior year is primarily driven by an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and an increase at AMC Networks and IFC of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  The increase at AMC Networks for the nine month period ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to an increase in management fees of $0.7 million resulting from increased revenue during the period.
increased $0.1 million (less than 1%) and $0.2 million (less than 1%) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same periods in 2005.
Depreciation and amortization
increased $0.4 million and $4.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 as compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively.  Interest expense on debt decreased by $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.   Interest expense increased $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher variable interest rates.  The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $0.9 million due principally to higher interest rates.
Interest expense, net
of $6.1 million in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 represents costs written off in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement in July 2006.
Write-off of deferred financing costs
of $6.2 million and $13.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, and state income taxes.
Income tax expense
The income tax expense of $9.1 million and $12.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, and state income taxes, offset by a $6.0 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a New York state tax law enacted in the second quarter of 2005.

CASH FLOW DISCUSSION
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $74.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to $67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.  The 2006 cash provided by operating activities resulted from $173.0 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non-cash items and a decrease in cash resulting from the purchase of feature film inventory and original programming licenses totaling $90.8 million and carriage payments of $23.3 million, partially offset by an increase in cash resulting from a net change in other assets and liabilities totaling $15.3 million.
The 2005 net cash provided by operating activities resulted from $160.6 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non-cash items and a decrease in cash resulting from a net increase in feature film inventory purchases totaling $79.0 million, an increase in deferred carriage fees of $81.1 million and net changes in other assets and liabilities totaling $6.4 million, partially offset by an increase in cash resulting from a net increase in current and non-current deferred carriage fees payable of $73.2 million.  The increase of $81.1 million in deferred carriage fees and the offsetting increase in current and non-current liabilities of $73.2 million, including an increase of $7.9 million included in other current and non-current liabilities, arose primarily as one part of a series of multiple agreements entered into simultaneously with the settlement of the litigation between AMC and Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. in September 2005.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $3.1 million compared to $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.  The 2006 and 2005 investing activities consisted of capital expenditures.  The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 primarily relates to the purchase of technical equipment for cable television systems and DBS operators to migrate to and receive a digital feed from an analog feed for the transmission of our networks.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $199.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to $14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.  In 2006, financing activities consisted of capital distributions to our parent of $135.0 million, repayment of bank debt of $595.5 million from our previous credit facility, partially offset by the proceeds from borrowings under our new credit facility (as described below) of $538.0 million, the payment of deferred financing costs associated with our new credit facility of $5.4 million, and principal payments on capital leases of $1.5 million.  In 2005, financing activities consisted of capital distributions to our parent of $10.0 million, repayment of bank debt of $3.0 million, and principal payments on capital leases of $1.4 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The operations of the businesses that are included in our consolidated financial statements collectively have historically generated net cash flow from operating activities.  However, each of our programming businesses has substantial programming, acquisition and development expenditure requirements.
We generated positive net cash from operating activities during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.  We currently expect our funding requirements for the next twelve months to be met by our cash on hand, cash from operations and available borrowings under our new credit facility entered into in July 2006 (see discussion below).  In addition, our cash on hand and net cash from operating activities, plus proceeds from borrowings available to us, has in the past provided, and is expected to continue to provide in the future, funding to other Rainbow programming services, which are not our subsidiaries, including the VOOM HD Networks, subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in our financing agreements.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we distributed $135.0 million to Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, our direct parent, to, among other things, fund Rainbow programming services, which are not our subsidiaries, including VOOM HD Networks.
The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, the present value of capital leases, interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2006:
 
Debt Financing Agreements
On July 5, 2006, we entered into an $800 million senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), which consists of a $500 million term A loan facility and a $300 million revolving credit facility.  The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012.  The Credit Agreement allows us to utilize up to $50 million of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5 million for a swing loan.  Further, the Credit Agreement provides for an incremental facility of up to a maximum of $925 million, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100 million.  If an incremental facility is established, we and the lenders will enter into a supplement to the Credit Agreement with terms and conditions that are no more restrictive than those in the Credit Agreement.  There are no commitments from the lenders to fund the incremental facility.
On July 5, 2006, we borrowed the entire $500 million term A loan facility and $10 million under the revolving credit facility. We used the $510 million borrowed under the Credit Agreement and approximately $88 million of additional available cash to repay all of our outstanding
11
borrowings, accrued interest and fees due under our August 2004 $950 million senior secured credit facility of which $592.5 million was outstanding under a term loan at July 5, 2006 (scheduled to mature March 31, 2012) and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement. We may use future borrowings under the Credit Agreement to make investments, distributions and other payments permitted under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid without penalty at any time.  Outstanding borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility at September 30, 2006 were $500 million and $38 million, respectively.  We had $262 million in undrawn revolver commitments at September 30, 2006.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are our direct obligations which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of our subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC.  Such borrowings are secured by the pledge of our stock and the stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries and all of our other assets and the assets of substantially all of our subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate under the Credit Agreement varies, depending on our cash flow ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), from 1.0% to 1.5% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar-based borrowings and from zero to 0.5% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings. At October 31, 2006, the interest rate on the term A loan facility and the revolving credit facility was 6.62% and 6.66%, respectively.  The $500 million term A loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original outstanding balance ($6.25 million) from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2010, 2.5% of the original outstanding balance ($12.5 million) from March 31, 2011 until December 31, 2012, and 32.5% of the original outstanding balance ($162.5 million) on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the term A loan maturity date.  Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012.
The financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 1.75 to 1.00, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 6.75 to 1.00 through June 30, 2008, decreasing thereafter to 6.25 to 1.00, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.00.  Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates.
We are obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn revolver commitment.
In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into in July 2006, we incurred deferred financing costs of approximately $5.4 million which are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.  We recorded $6.1 million as a write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the August 2004 credit facility in July 2006.
Our notes outstanding consist of $300 million principal amount of 8-3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500 million principal amount of 10-3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014.  These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.
12
We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants as of September 30, 2006.
Future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are influenced by our credit ratings, which are provided by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.  In February 2006, Standard & Poor's announced that our corporate credit rating was changed to BB from BB-, and the senior and senior subordinated unsecured debt to B+ from B.  The ratings outlook was changed to stable from developing.  In June 2006, Standard & Poor's assigned a BBB- rating to the Credit Facility entered into in July 2006; all other ratings remained unchanged.  In August 2006, Standard & Poor's placed all our ratings on creditwatch with negative implications as a result of the stock option review.  In September 2006, Standard & Poor's affirmed all of our ratings and removed all ratings from creditwatch as a result of Cablevision and CSC's filing of its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2006.  Moody's ratings are B1 for the corporate family rating, Ba3 for the senior secured bank loan, B2 for the senior unsecured debt and B3 for the senior subordinated debt and the ratings outlook is stable.  In June 2006, Moody's assigned a Ba3 rating to the Credit Agreement and affirmed the ratings noted above.  In September 2006, Moody's upgraded our senior secured bank debt rating from Ba3 to Ba1.  In October 2006, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's placed all of our ratings on creditwatch with negative implications and review for downgrade, respectively, following the Dolan Family Group Proposal (as described below).  Any future downgrade to our credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate make capital on future debt issuances and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds.
Total scheduled principal amounts payable in connection with the Credit Agreement and our notes and capital leases outstanding are as follows for the following periods:
 
Recent Events
On October 8, 2006, Cablevision received a proposal from the Dolan Family Group (the "Dolan Family Group Proposal") to acquire, at a purchase price of $27.00 per share in cash, all of the outstanding shares of Cablevision's common stock, except for the shares held by the Dolan Family Group.  The Dolan Family Group Proposal contemplates that substantially all of the purchase price would be funded by the incurrence of additional indebtedness by Cablevision, CSC Holdings, the Company and several other subsidiaries of Cablevision and CSC Holdings.
Cablevision's Board of Directors appointed a special transaction committee of independent directors, which consists of Thomas V. Reifenheiser and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan USN (Ret.), to review the proposal. The special transaction committee has retained Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as its legal counsel, and Lehman Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans("Statement No. 158"). Statement No. 158 requires companies to recognize in their statement of financial position an asset for a post-retirement plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status and to measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the company's fiscal year. Additionally, Statement No. 158 requires companies to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur and to report those changes in comprehensive income. The provisions of Statement No. 158 have two separate effective dates. The provision of Statement No. 158 that requires a company (with a calendar year-end) to recognize the funded status of its pension plan, and the disclosure requirements, would be effective as of December 31, 2006, and the provision of Statement No. 158 that requires a company (with a calendar year-end) to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its fiscal year-end balance sheet would be effective as of December 31, 2008.  Cablevision has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 158 will have on its financial statements.
  Statement No. 157 will be effective for financial statements issued with fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 157 will have on our financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("Statement No. 157"). Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under Statement No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts.  It also clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, however, for some entities, the application of Statement No. 157 could change current practices.
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.  SAB No. 108 requires the use of two alternative approaches in quantitatively evaluating materiality of misstatements. If the misstatement as quantified under either approach is material to the current year financial statements, the misstatement must be corrected. If the effect of correcting the prior year misstatements, if any, in the current year income statement is material, the prior year financial statements should be corrected. In the year of adoption, the misstatements may be corrected as an accounting change by adjusting opening member's deficiency rather than being included in the current year income statement.  SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006, with earlier adoption encouraged.  We do not expect the adoption of SAB No. 108 to have a material impact on our financial statements.
14
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.  This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, .  FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Any change in the net assets and liabilities recognized as a result of applying the provisions of FIN 48 would be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of member's deficiency.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.  We have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial statements.
Accounting for Income Taxes
In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) ("EITF Issue No. 06-3"), which addresses the income statement disclosures for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, and may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.  The presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 22.  In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant and can be done on an aggregate basis.  EITF Issue No. 06-3 will be effective for financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006.  We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue No. 06-3 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
In February 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 ("Statement No. 155").  Statement No. 155 allows financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative and that otherwise would require bifurcation to be accounted for as a whole on a fair value basis, at the holders' election. Statement No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 and Financial Accounting Standards No. 140.  Statement No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006.  We do not expect the adoption of Statement No. 155 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
