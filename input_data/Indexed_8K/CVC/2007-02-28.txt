Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.
Bethpage, N.Y., February 27, 2007
increased 7.7% to $514.8 million.
Fourth quarter consolidated net revenue grew 13.4% to just under $1.7 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow.  Consolidated operating income declined 9.4% to $208.3 million while consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")
1
For the full year 2006, consolidated net revenue increased 14.6% to $5.9 billion, driven by the addition of over 1.4 million Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") during the year in Telecommunications Services combined with revenue growth at all other reporting segments.  Consolidated operating income increased 22.6% to $614.0 million and consolidated AOCF grew 13.0% to $1,820.4 million for full year 2006.
Operating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 include:
Cable Television net revenue growth of 18.6% and 18.1% and AOCF growth of 16.8% and 19.4% for the quarter and full year, respectively
                 
Eleventh consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains; 3.3% growth for the year
                 
Record annual RGU growth of more than 1.4 million new video, high-speed data and voice units
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $115.30 in the fourth quarter 2006
                 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "For our cable business, 2006 marked the most successful year in the company's history with our largest annual revenue gain ever.  The ongoing strong demand we are experiencing for our digital video, voice and data services continued to drive industry-leading penetration rates.  For 2006, our long list of milestones includes surpassing 1 million voice customers and 2 million data customers, and adding basic video customers for the eleventh consecutive quarter.  With our operating successes and state-of-the-art technology, we like our competitive position going forward," concluded Mr. Dolan.

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the fourth quarter 2006 rose 17.9% to $1,119.6 million, operating income increased 12.1% to $195.4 million, and AOCF grew 15.1% to $436.3 million, all compared to the prior year period.
Full year 2006 net revenue rose 17.5% to $4.2 billion, operating income increased 28.7% to $713.4 million, and AOCF increased 18.2% to $1.7 billion, all as compared to the prior year.
Cable Television 
Cable Television fourth quarter 2006 net revenues increased 18.6% to $1,078.9 million, operating income increased 15.2% to $201.2 million and AOCF rose 16.8% to $422.3 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The increases in net revenue, operating income and AOCF resulted principally from growth in video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the addition of over 1.4 million Revenue Generating Units since December 2005.
Highlights include:
customers up 16,000 or 0.5% from September 2006 and 100,000 or 3.3% from December 2005; eleventh consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains

iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 75,000 or 3.8% from September 2006 and 345,000 or 20.4% from December 2005

Cable
Television RPS
Lightpath
For fourth quarter 2006, Lightpath net revenues increased 1.7% to $51.7 million, operating loss increased $5.4 million to $5.8 million and AOCF declined 19.0% to $14.0 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services and Optimum Voice call completion activity, offset by a decline in traditional circuit switched services.  The increase in operating loss and decline in AOCF were primarily impacted by a prior year favorable settlement with another carrier, as well as higher sales and marketing costs in 2006, partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above.
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our National Programming services - AMC, IFC and WE tv as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Bay Area, fuse, MagRack, sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
Rainbow net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 12.4% to $236.7 million, operating income declined 21.9% to $19.2 million and AOCF rose 26.0% to $53.3 million, all compared to the prior year period.
Full year 2006 net revenue rose 7.3% to $886.0 million, operating income declined 25.5% to $28.7 million and AOCF increased 1.6% to $161.1 million, all compared to 2005.

AMC/IFC/WE tv
Fourth quarter 2006 net revenues of the combined National Services grew 12.2% to $160.0 million, operating income rose 23.4% to $65.4 million and AOCF rose 26.3% to $83.7 million, each compared to the prior year period.
The fourth quarter 2006 results reflect:
A 27.6% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher sellout rates
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 7.5% at IFC, 3.5% at WE tv and 5.1% at AMC (AMC's growth includes 1.8 million new Canadian subscribers), all compared to December 2005
                 
A 3.8% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
Slightly lower operating expenses than the prior year period, principally due to lower programming costs
                 
Full year 2006 net revenues grew 8.0% to $601.6 million, operating income rose 6.2% to $197.3 million and AOCF rose 8.7% to $269.5 million, all compared to 2005.
Other Programming
Fourth quarter 2006 net revenues rose 12.4% to $82.3 million, operating loss increased 62.5% to $46.2 million and the AOCF deficit increased 26.8% to $30.4 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher revenue at the VOOM HD Networks, fuse, and regional sports and news.  The increase in both operating loss and AOCF deficit is principally the result of higher programming costs, partially offset by the higher revenues discussed above.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex, Radio City Music Hall, and the Beacon Theatre.
Madison Square Garden's fourth quarter 2006 net revenue of $339.6 million was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.  Fourth quarter 2006 operating income declined 53.2% to $35.2 million and AOCF declined 37.4% to $53.6 million, both compared to the prior year period.
MSG's fourth quarter 2006 results were primarily impacted by:
Higher Knicks and Rangers net revenues of $6.8 million, primarily due to higher game-related revenues and league royalties, offset by $29.4 million of higher team-related expenses, primarily Knicks personnel transactions
                 
Lower MSG network net revenue of $7.4 million and lower expenses of $2.9 million primarily related to the termination of the Mets broadcast agreement (October 2005)
                 
Higher revenue and AOCF from the Radio City Christmas shows and from family shows (e.g. Annie) of $11.0 million and $6.6 million, respectively
                 
Lower concert revenue and AOCF of $11.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, due to fewer performances
                 
Madison Square Garden's full year 2006, net revenue increased 6.2% to $854.0 million, operating income decreased $55.4 million to an operating loss of $2.0 million and AOCF declined 39.9% to $72.4 million, all as compared to the prior year.

Notes:
Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to the detailed definition of AOCF and discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure below and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Operating results of FSN Chicago and Rainbow DBS' distribution operations are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
2.
              
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of variable stock options and stock appreciation rights (for the 2005 period) or stock appreciation rights (for the 2006 period) and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
