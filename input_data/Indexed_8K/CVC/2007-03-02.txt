Exhibit 99.1
The Board of Directors
Rainbow National Services LLC:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rainbow National Services LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, member's deficiency and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006.  In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule (Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts).  These consolidated financial statements and the accompanying consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Rainbow National Services LLC has operated as an integral part of Cablevision.  As described in Notes 1, 6 and 7, these consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations.  The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Rainbow National Services LLC could differ from those that might have resulted had Rainbow National Services LLC been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), , as of January 1, 2006.
Share-Based Payment
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rainbow National Services LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTE 1.                BUSINESS
Nature of Operations
In July 2004, Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") formed Rainbow National Services LLC (the "Company").  Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC ("Rainbow Programming Holdings"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, owns 100% of the membership interests in the Company.  The Company is a holding company with no independent operations of its own.  Its subsidiaries include entities that principally own nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment services operated as integral parts of Cablevision, including AMC, WE tv (formerly WE: Women's Entertainment) and IFC.  The Company's consolidated financial statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cablevision and reflect certain assumptions and allocations (see notes 6 and 7).  The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company could differ from those that might have resulted had the Company been operated autonomously or as an entity independent of Cablevision.
In August 2004, the common equity membership interests of American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC") and its wholly owned subsidiaries (including WE: Women's Entertainment LLC ("WE LLC")) and The Independent Film Channel LLC ("IFC LLC") and its wholly owned subsidiaries were contributed to the Company.  For accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as a reorganization of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests whereby the assets and liabilities were transferred at historical cost.  Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company as if the transaction occurred on January 1, 2004.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for annual financial information as required by the Company's indentures (see note 4) even though the Company is not a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
.  The broadcast years ended December 31,
The Company recognizes affiliate fee revenue from cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies as programming is provided.  Advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired in accordance with the broadcast year which ends on the last Sunday on or prior to December 31
st
7
2005 and 2004 included 52 weeks and in 2006, the broadcast year included 53 weeks.  In some advertising sales arrangements, the Company's programming businesses guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming.  For these types of transactions, a portion of such revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when the Company provides the required additional advertising time, the guarantee obligation contractually expires or performance becomes remote.
Multiple-Element Transactions
If there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of accounting in a multiple-element arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate elements of accounting based on relative fair values.  There may be cases in which there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered items.  In those cases, the Company utilizes the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration.  Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items.
The Company together with other subsidiaries of Cablevision, may enter into affiliation agreements which are documented in one or more contracts; however negotiated contemporaneously.  Amounts paid/received by other subsidiaries of Cablevision or the Company may differ from the amounts that would have been paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately.  Where Cablevision has incurred a cost incremental to fair value and the Company has received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations in the form of increased affiliation fee revenues, Cablevision charges the Company for the incremental amount.  Likewise, where the Company has incurred a cost incremental to fair value and Cablevision has received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations in the form of decreased programming costs, the Company charges Cablevision for the incremental amount. Judgments made in determining fair value impact the amount and period in which revenues are recognized over the term of the affiliation agreement.  In determining fair value, the Company refers to historical transactions or comparable cash transactions.
Technical and Operating Expenses
Costs of revenue related to sales of programming services including, but not limited to, license fees, amortization of film inventory, and production costs, are classified as "technical and operating" expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred.  Advertising costs were $44,189, $45,286 and $53,625 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
8
Accounts Receivable
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of valuation allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable by evaluating the collectibility of outstanding receivables and general factors such as length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and the economic and competitive environment.
Feature Film Programming Rights
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then when the uncertainty is resolved.  Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on a straight-line basis over the respective license periods.  The Company periodically reviews the programming usefulness of its feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness of exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service.  If it is determined that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, a write-off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films is recorded in technical and operating expense.  Impairment charges of $297 were recorded in 2004; no such charges were recorded in 2006 and 2005.
Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments.  Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements, amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the assets' useful lives and reported in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of income.
Intangible assets established in connection with purchase accounting transactions consist of affiliation agreements, advertiser relationships, other intangibles and excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill").  These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, except goodwill which has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization that arose from purchase accounting transactions) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
9
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill which would be recognized in purchase accounting transactions.
Feature Film Obligations
Amounts payable subsequent to December 31, 2006 related to the license of feature film inventory are as follows:
 
In July 2003, AMC LLC, WE LLC, IFC LLC and Rainbow Media Holdings LLC ("Rainbow Media Holdings"), the Company's indirect parent, as licensees, entered into an agreement with a film studio for feature film telecast rights.  Each licensee recorded its allocated share of the film inventory asset and all of the payment obligations for which they are jointly and severally liable.  Such payments initially amounted to $84,000 in total of which $60,000 remained unpaid at December 31, 2006 and is included in the amounts above.  Film assets of approximately $17,000 were allocated outside of the Company during 2003.  Payments of feature film obligations by affiliates for film assets allocated outside of the Company amounted to $1,817, $1,212, and $707 during 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively.  The allocation of these film assets was treated as a deemed capital distribution in 2003 and the payments made by affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, were treated as deemed capital contributions in the consolidated statements of member's deficiency.
Deferred Carriage Fees
Deferred carriage fees represent amounts principally paid or payable to cable system and/or direct broadcast satellite operators to guarantee carriage of certain programming services and are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related guarantee (2 to 13 years).
10
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs incurred to obtain debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the related debt.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("Statement No. 109"), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and permits the recognition of deferred tax assets, subject to an ongoing assessment of realizability.  The Company provides deferred taxes for the outside basis difference of its investment in partnerships.
Since there is no tax sharing agreement in place between the Company and Cablevision, allocable current income tax liabilities calculated on a separate company basis that the Company did not pay directly have been reflected as deemed capital contributions to the Company from its parent.  Such contributions amounted to $39,810, $30,925, and $57,454 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
The Company was included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Cablevision for the years presented herein.  The income tax expense presented in the consolidated statements of income is based upon the taxable income of the Company on a separate return basis. 
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 equals net income for the respective periods.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
Cash Flows
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers short-term investments with a maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company's non-cash investing and financing activities and other supplemental data were as follows:
 
11
 
 
During 2005, $2,594 of excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was pushed down to the Company from Rainbow Media Holdings. This pushdown of basis was recorded as a deemed capital contribution.
During 2005, $155,567 of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings were converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
During 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash equity distribution of approximately $1,400 to Rainbow Media Holdings to reflect the resolution of certain film rights agreements associated with Rainbow Media Holdings' sale of an affiliate in 2002.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ("Statement No. 133").  Statement No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives, as defined, as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values.  The Company's embedded derivative financial instruments are clearly and closely related to the host contracts, therefore, such derivative financial instruments are not accounted for on a stand-alone basis.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Commitments and Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.
12
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans ("Statement No. 158").  Statement No. 158 requires companies to recognize in their statement of financial position an asset for a postretirement plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status and to measure a plan's assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the company's fiscal year.  Additionally, Statement No. 158 requires companies to recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur and to report those changes in comprehensive income (loss).  The provisions of Statement No. 158 have two separate effective dates.  The provision of Statement No. 158 that requires a company (with a calendar year-end) to recognize the funded status of its pension plan, and the disclosure requirements, was effective as of December 31, 2006, and the provision of Statement No. 158 that requires a company (with a calendar year-end) to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its fiscal year-end balance sheet is effective as of December 31, 2008.  Cablevision adopted Statement No. 158 effective December 31, 2006.  Although the Company receives an applicable allocation of costs related to Cablevision's defined benefit plans, the adoption by Cablevision had no impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements, as payments under these plans are direct obligations of Cablevision.
Share-Based Payments
Cablevision adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ("Statement No. 123R"), on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method.   The modified prospective method requires that share-based compensation expense be recorded for all new or modified share-based awards granted after January 1, 2006, as well as for the unvested portion of restricted share awards and stock option awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 over the remaining service periods related to such awards, after adjustment for estimated forfeitures, and the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods are not restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of Statement No. 123R.  Cablevision will continue using the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments.  In accordance with the pro forma disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123, Cablevision recognized the majority of the share-based compensation costs using the accelerated attribution method.  Effective January 1, 2006, Cablevision recognized the cost for previously granted share-based awards under the accelerated attribution method and recognized the compensation expense for new share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  In connection with Cablevision's adoption of Statement No. 123R, the Company recorded an allocated charge of $121 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes of $72, in the Company's consolidated statement of income for 2006. Share-based compensation expense allocated to the Company by Cablevision (excluding the impact of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes discussed above) amounted to $10,749, $1,212, and $2,447 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and has been recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense and as a deemed capital contribution.
13
 
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 ("Statement No. 154").  It applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable.  APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 requires that a change in method of calculating depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle.  APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle.  Statement No. 154 was effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made by the Company beginning January 1, 2006.
Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements ("SAB No. 108").  SAB No. 108 is effective for the Company's year ended December 31, 2006.  SAB No. 108 requires the use of two alternative approaches in quantitatively evaluating materiality of misstatements (the "dual method"). If the misstatement as quantified under either approach is material to the current year financial statements, the misstatement must be corrected. If the effect of correcting the prior year misstatements, if any, in the current year income statement is material, the prior year financial statements should be corrected. However, in the year of adoption, the misstatements may be corrected by adjusting opening member's deficiency rather than being included in the current year income statement if there is a material misstatement under the dual method but not under the Company's previous evaluation method.  In connection with the adoption of SAB No. 108 by Cablevision, the Company evaluated whether the adoption of SAB No. 108 would impact the Company's financial statements.  Since the Company had no material misstatements under the dual method, the adoption did not impact its consolidated financial statements.  However, the adoption of SAB No. 108 by Cablevision resulted in the push down of additional goodwill to the Company in the amount of $27,625 (see note 3).

NOTE 2.                PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment (including equipment under capital leases) consist of the following assets, which are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives shown below:
 
Depreciation expense on property and equipment (including capital leases) amounted to $5,780, $5,298 and $7,487, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the gross amount of equipment and related accumulated amortization recorded under capital leases were as follows:
 
NOTE 3.                INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The following table summarizes information relating to the Company's acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005:
 
15
 
 
 
The changes in the carrying amount of excess costs over the fair value of net assets acquired for the year ended December 31, 2006 are as follows:
 
During 2006, $27,625 of excess costs over the fair value of net assets acquired was pushed down to the Company from Rainbow Media Holdings as a result of the adoption of SAB No. 108 by Cablevision. This pushdown of basis was recorded as a deemed capital contribution amounting to $18,095 in addition to the recognition of an additional deferred income tax liability of $9,530.
NOTE 4. 
DEBT
                                          
On July 5, 2006, the Company entered into a replacement bank facility providing for an $800,000 senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), which consists of a $500,000 term A loan facility and a $300,000 revolving credit facility which was used primarily to refinance its then existing credit facility.  The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012.  The Credit Agreement allows the Company to utilize up to $50,000 of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5,000 for a swing loan.  Further, the Credit Agreement provides for an incremental facility of up to $925,000, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100,000.  If an incremental facility is established, the Company and the lenders will enter into a supplement to the Credit Agreement with terms and conditions that are no more restrictive than those in the Credit Agreement.  There are no commitments from the lenders to fund an incremental facility.
On July 5, 2006, the Company borrowed the entire $500,000 term A loan and $10,000 under the revolving credit facility. The Company used the $510,000 borrowed under the Credit Agreement and $88,048 of additional available cash to repay all of its outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due under its August 2004 $950,000 senior secured credit facility of which $592,500 was outstanding under a term loan at July 5, 2006 (scheduled to mature March 31, 2012) and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement. The Company may use future borrowings under the Credit Agreement to make investments,
16
distributions and other payments permitted under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid without penalty at any time.  At December 31, 2006, $500,000 was outstanding under the term A loan and $10,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  Since the inception of the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed an additional $28,000 under the revolving credit facility which was repaid as of December 31, 2006.  The Company had $290,000 in undrawn revolver commitments at December 31, 2006.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are direct obligations of the Company which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of its subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings, the direct parent of the Company, and are secured by the pledge of the stock of the Company and the stock of substantially all of its subsidiaries and all of the other assets of the Company and substantially all of its subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate under the Credit Agreement varies, depending on the Company's cash flow ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), from 1.0% to 1.5% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar-based borrowings and from zero to 0.5% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings. On December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the term A loan facility and the revolving credit facility was 6.62% and 6.60%, respectively.  The $500,000 term A loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original outstanding balance ($6,250) from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2010, 2.5% of the original outstanding balance ($12,500) from March 31, 2011 until December 31, 2012, and 32.5% of the original outstanding balance ($162,500) on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the term A loan maturity date.  Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012.
The financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 1.75 to 1, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 6.75 to 1 through June 30, 2008, decreasing thereafter to 6.25 to 1, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to annualized operating cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.  Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates.
The Company is obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn revolver commitment.
In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $5,535 which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.  The Company recorded $6,084 as a write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the August 2004 credit facility in July 2006.
The Company's notes outstanding consist of $300,000 face amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500,000 face amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due
17
September 1, 2014.  These senior notes and the senior subordinated notes were discounted $2,163 and $3,915, respectively, upon original issuance in 2004.  Net proceeds from these notes totaled approximately $775,900, net of financing costs.  These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries.  Principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 7.0 times, decreasing to 6.0 times after January 1, 2009, limitations on dividends and distributions, and limitations on investments and the ability to incur liens (according to the terms of the senior note indenture).
The Company may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of face value at any time on or after September 1, 2008, 102.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, and 100% on or after September 1, 2010.  The senior subordinated notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 105.188% of face value on or after September 1, 2009, 103.458% on or after September 1, 2010, 101.729% on or after September 1, 2011, and 100% on or after September 1, 2012.  Each series of notes is  redeemable at the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.
In addition, the Company may redeem up to 35% of each of the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes before September 1, 2007 at a redemption price of 108.75% and 110.375% of the principal amounts, respectively, using the net cash proceeds from specified equity offerings (as defined under the terms of the indentures), provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding immediately subsequent to the redemption.
The indentures under which the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes were issued contain various covenants, which are generally less restrictive than those contained in the Credit Agreement.
The Company is in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2006.
The Company has no independent assets or operations of its own, the guarantees under the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, and the net assets of any subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor.  There are no restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of the subsidiary guarantors to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
In August 2004, when the Company entered into the then senior secured credit facility that was refinanced by the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $600,000 under a term loan, which with the proceeds from the senior and senior subordinated notes provided $1,366,150 of funds that were distributed to Rainbow Programming Holdings and recorded as a capital contribution in 2004.
In August 2004, AMC LLC issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and
18
converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the contribution was to reduce debt by $350,000 and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
Summary of Five-Year Debt Maturities
Total amounts payable by the Company under its various debt obligations (excluding capital leases) outstanding as of December 31, 2006, during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2006 are as follows:
 
NOTE 5.                LEASES
Cablevision, and companies owned or managed by Cablevision, lease certain office and transmission facilities under long-term lease agreements with non-affiliates.  The leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals plus certain real estate taxes and other costs.  The Company pays its share of monthly lease payments for the portion of the premises occupied by its employees.  Rent expense incurred by the Company which was allocated by Cablevision or a company owned or managed by Cablevision for such leases was $1,484, $1,298 and $1,871, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company lease office facilities under long-term non-cancelable operating lease agreements with non-affiliates which expire at various dates through 2011.  The leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals plus certain other costs.  Rent expense, which includes rent relating to office and transmission facilities, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $3,364, $4,759, and $3,966, respectively.
The minimum future annual payments for all operating leases with non-affiliates (with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year) during the next five years from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2011 and thereafter, at rates now in force are as follows:
 
Future minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 2006 are as follows:

NOTE 6.                AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS
Allocations
The consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the application of certain allocation policies of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings, which are summarized below.  Management believes that these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis.  However, it is not practicable to determine whether the allocated amounts represent amounts that might have been incurred on a stand-alone basis, as there are no company-specific or comparable industry benchmarks with which to make such estimates.  Explanations of the composition and the amounts of the more significant allocations are described below.
Corporate General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs, including costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions (such as human resources, legal, finance, tax, accounting, audit, treasury, strategic planning, information technology, creative and production services, etc.) have been allocated to the Company by Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings.  Certain allocations are generally based on relative revenues or expenses of the Company in relation to those of consolidated Rainbow Media Holdings.  The remaining overhead, principally salaries of corporate executives, is primarily allocated based on management's estimate of the level of effort expended on each business unit based on historical trends.  Such costs allocated to the Company amounted to $37,277, $30,229 and $28,332 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Health and Welfare Plans
Employees of the Company participate in health and welfare plans sponsored by Cablevision.  Health and welfare benefit costs have generally been allocated by Cablevision based upon the proportionate number of participants in the plans.  Such costs amounted to $1,542, $1,508, and $1,660 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
20
Related Party Transactions
As described below, the Company provides services to and receives services from affiliates of Cablevision and Rainbow Media Holdings.  As many of these transactions are conducted between subsidiaries under common control of Cablevision, amounts charged for these services may not represent amounts that might have been received or incurred if the transactions were based upon arm's length negotiations.
The Company distributes programming services to the pay television industry under contracts referred to as affiliation agreements.  Revenues earned under affiliation agreements with companies owned by or affiliated with Cablevision for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $14,214, $11,648, and $10,373, respectively.
Rainbow Media Holdings pays the Company for advertising revenue earned in connection with an agreement between Rainbow Media Holdings and a third party entered into during 2000.  Such revenues were $170 for the year ended December 31, 2004.  There were no revenues related to this arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.  In addition, the Company recorded advertising revenues of $20, $153, and $121 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, from subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings.  The Company incurred $728, $369, and $661 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for advertising expenses charged by subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings and Cablevision.
The Company provided affiliate sales support functions which primarily included salaries, facilities, and general and administrative costs, to affiliates of Rainbow Media Holdings during 2004.  These costs were recorded as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative costs and amounted to $4,914 for the year ended December 31, 2004.  During 2006 and 2005, these support functions were consolidated at Rainbow Media Holdings and a portion of the costs were charged to the Company.  These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $8,455 and $7,472 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
During 2006 and 2005, Rainbow Media Holdings provided various public relations, acquisitions, digital media and administrative support functions which primarily included salaries, facilities, and general and administrative costs, to the Company.  These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and amounted to $8,527 and $8,048 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Prior to 2005, these costs were borne directly by the Company.
The Company has the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings in addition to subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings having the right to exhibit and promote films under contracts between the Company and third parties.  Net amounts (credited) charged to technical and operating expense of the Company under these arrangements amounted to $(2,974), $2,123, and $2,564 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Cablevision and the Company may enter into agreements with third parties in which the amounts paid/received by Cablevision or the Company may differ from the amounts that would have been
21
paid/received if such arrangements were negotiated separately.   Where Cablevision has incurred a cost incremental to fair value and the Company has received a benefit incremental to fair value from these negotiations in the form of increased affiliation fee revenues, Cablevision charges the Company for the incremental amount.  In one such agreement executed in 2005, Cablevision charged the Company approximately $4,900, which was recorded as deferred carriage fees by the Company and is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the remaining license period of the affiliation agreement.  Amortization of this charge amounted to $371 and $92 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Rainbow Network Communications ("RNC"), a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings, provides certain transmission and production services to the Company.  The Company was charged $8,550, $7,731, and $9,069 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for these services.  The decrease from 2004 to 2005 resulted from amounts charged by a third party directly to the Company as opposed to such cost being allocated from RNC.  The Company has entered into agreements that allow RNC to continue providing these services through 2021.  Future cash payments required under these agreements amount to $7,746 in 2007, $8,091 in 2008, $8,455 in 2009, $8,836 in 2010, $9,235 in 2011, and $105,377 thereafter.
Under contractual agreements, CSC Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, provides certain management services to the Company.  These agreements provide for payment, in addition to expense reimbursement, of an aggregate fee of 3.5% of AMC LLC and WE LLC's gross revenues, as defined in the management agreement.  The agreements are automatically renewable every five years at the option of Cablevision.  Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company was charged management fees of $17,795, $16,574, and $15,485, in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
Cablevision allocates to the Company its proportionate share of expenses or benefits related to Cablevision's employee stock plans and Cablevision's long-term incentive plans.  For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded a net expense of $10,749, $1,212, and $2,447, respectively, for its proportionate share of the Cablevision stock plan expense and recorded an expense of $8,230, $5,282, and $1,527, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to Cablevision's long-term incentive plan.  Such amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  Liabilities related to the stock appreciation rights ("SARs") granted under the Cablevision employee stock plans are funded by Rainbow Media Holdings and are reflected as capital contributions from Rainbow Media Holdings in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  The long-term incentive plans are funded by the Company and aggregate liabilities of $20,654 and $12,599, related to these plans are included in accrued employee related costs and other long-term liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  These liabilities include certain performance based awards for which the performance criteria had not been met as of December 31, 2006 as such awards are based on achievement of certain performance criteria through December 31, 2008.  The Company currently believes that it is probable that the performance criteria established for these performance based awards will be met.  If the Company subsequently determines that the performance criteria for such awards is not probable of being achieved, the Company would reverse the accrual in respect of such award at that time.

NOTE 7.                BENEFIT PLANS
Cablevision sponsors a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit cash balance pension plan, a non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit excess cash balance plan, a qualified defined contribution 401(k) savings plan and a non-qualified excess savings plan in which certain employees of the Company participate.  In connection with the cash balance plan and excess cash balance plan, the Company is charged by Cablevision for credits made into an account established for each participant.  Such credits are based upon a percentage of eligible base pay and a market-based rate of return.  The Company also makes matching contributions for a portion of employee voluntary contributions to the 401(k) savings and excess savings plan.  Total expense related to these plans was $952, $887, and $851 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  The Company does not provide postretirement benefits for any of its employees.
NOTE 8.                INCOME TAXES
The Company is a single-member limited liability company, wholly-owned indirectly by Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. ("RME") (a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings), a taxable corporation.  RME is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Cablevision.  As such, the Company is treated as a division of RME and is included in the consolidated income tax return of Cablevision for federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, based upon the provisions of Statement No. 109, the income tax provision is determined on a stand-alone basis as if the Company filed separate consolidated income tax returns for the periods presented herein.
Income tax expense of the Company consists of the following components:
 
The income tax expense of the Company differs from the amount derived by applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the effect of the following items:
23
 
 
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets or liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:
 
AMC LLC is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes.  Accordingly, the Company records deferred income taxes for the outside basis difference with regard to its investment in AMC LLC.
Deferred tax assets have resulted from the Company's future deductible temporary differences. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its deductible temporary differences.  If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company's consolidated statement of income.  Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for valuation allowances quarterly.  As of December 31, 2006, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will fully realize the benefit associated with its gross deferred tax assets.

NOTE 9.                OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS
Off balance sheet commitments (excluding previously disclosed operating lease commitments) not reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 increased approximately $12,000 to approximately $249,000 as compared to approximately $237,000 outstanding at December 31, 2005.  The increase in 2006 resulted primarily from the addition of future film/production obligations of approximately $21,000, partially offset by the decrease of future marketing commitments of $2,000 and transmission service commitments of approximately $7,000.
Off balance sheet commitments (excluding previously disclosed operating lease commitments) as of December 31, 2006 and for the ensuing calendar years are $55,035 in 2007, $20,683 in 2008, $21,678 in 2009, $18,507 in 2010, $13,842 in 2011, and $118,900 thereafter.   Off balance sheet commitments consist primarily of commitments for future film/production obligations (approximately $95,000), commitments for future marketing obligations (approximately $6,000), and commitments for technical and support transmission services with RNC (approximately $148,000).

DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                                   
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Trade, Accounts Receivable-Affiliates, Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities and Accounts Payable to Affiliates
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Bank Debt, Senior Notes, and Senior Subordinated Notes
The fair value of each of the Company's debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities.
The fair value of the Company's debt instruments are summarized as follows:
 
25
 
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
NOTE 11.              LEGAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to various claims in the ordinary course of business.  Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company's results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company or the ability of the Company to meet its financial obligations as they become due.
Broadcast Music, Inc. Matter
Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI"), an organization that licenses the performance of musical compositions of respective members, has alleged that certain of the Company's subsidiaries require a license to exhibit musical compositions in their respective catalogs. BMI agreed to interim fees based on revenues covering certain periods for certain subsidiaries. These matters were submitted to a Federal Rate Court.  The interim fees paid to BMI remain subject to retroactive adjustment until such time as either a final decision is made by the Court or an agreement is reached by the parties.
Accounting Related Investigations
The improper expense recognition matter previously reported by Cablevision has been the subject of investigations by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.  The SEC is continuing to investigate the improper expense recognition matter and Cablevision's timing of recognition of launch support, marketing and other payments under affiliation agreements.
Stock Option Related Matters
Cablevision and CSC Holdings announced on August 8, 2006 that, based on a voluntary review of past practices in connection with grants of stock options and SARs, they had determined that the grant date and exercise price assigned to a number of their stock option and SAR grants during the 1997-2002 period did not correspond to the actual grant date and the fair market value of Cablevision's common stock on the actual grant date.  The review was conducted with a law firm that was not previously involved with the Cablevision stock option plans.  Cablevision and CSC Holdings have advised the SEC and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of
26
New York of these matters and each has commenced an investigation.  Cablevision and CSC Holdings have received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York seeking documents related to the stock option issues. Cablevision and CSC Holdings have also received a document request from the SEC relating to its informal investigation into these matters.  Cablevision and CSC Holdings continue to fully cooperate with such government investigations.
NOTE 12.              SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments: AMC Networks (which includes AMC and WE tv) and IFC.  These reportable segments are strategic business units that are managed separately.  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment adjusted operating cash flow (defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits), a non-GAAP measure.  The Company has presented the components that reconcile adjusted operating cash flow to operating income, an accepted GAAP measure, as well as information as to the operations of the Company's business segments below.
 
 
Reconciliation (by Segment and in Total) of Adjusted Operating Cash Flow to Operating Income
 
 
27
 
 
 
A reconciliation of reportable segment amounts to the Company's consolidated balances is as follows:
 
 
 
Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company's reportable segments are attributed to or located in the United States.
Concentrations and Credit Risk
Financial instruments that may potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash is invested in bank time deposits offered by financial institutions that have received the highest rating awarded by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.  The Company had three customers that in
28
 
the aggregate accounted for approximately 32% and 35% of the Company's consolidated net trade receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 39%, 40% and 41% of the Company's net revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Each of these customers accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's net revenues in 2006, 14%, 13% and 13% of the Company's net revenues in 2005, and 15%, 14% and 12% of the Company's net revenues in 2004.  The AMC Networks and IFC segments reported such revenues.
NOTE 13.              INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)
The following is a summary of selected quarterly financial data of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005:
 
 
Advertising revenue is recognized in accordance with the broadcast year which ends on the last Sunday on or prior to the last day of each quarter.  Each quarter in the two years ended December 31, 2006 included 13 weeks, except the quarter ended December 31, 2006 included 14 weeks.

NOTE 14.              OTHER MATTERS
On November 14, 2003, AMC LLC filed an action against Time Warner Entertainment, L.P. ("Time Warner") in New York State Supreme Court for declaratory relief and damages caused by Time Warner's anticipatory repudiation of its cable television affiliation agreement with AMC LLC. AMC LLC filed that action as a result of Time Warner's notice purporting to terminate the contract based upon Time Warner's allegation that AMC LLC had changed its programming. AMC LLC sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to full performance of the agreement, and, at its option, was entitled to rescind the agreement and recover damages.  Time Warner filed an answer and counterclaims in December 2003 seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment as to its right to terminate the affiliation agreement, an injunction requiring AMC LLC to deliver a classic films channel and damages for an alleged breach of contract.  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.  On July 8, 2005, the trial court granted Time Warner's summary judgment motion as to liability (reserving the issue of damages for trial) and as to its right to a declaration that it may terminate the affiliation agreement, and the court dismissed AMC LLC's complaint.  On September 29, 2005, the parties signed a settlement agreement and a stipulation discontinuing the action that was filed with the court on October 5, 2005. As part of the settlement of the Time Warner litigation with AMC LLC, Cablevision simultaneously entered into 11 separate affiliation agreements with Time Warner.  These agreements included amendments and enhancements to existing affiliation agreements for some of Cablevision's programming services and new affiliation agreements and new distribution for other programming services of Cablevision.  The amendments included a long-term extension of Time Warner's affiliation agreement with AMC LLC with rate and positioning terms that are favorable to AMC LLC.  Because of the long-term benefits to AMC LLC from the extension and enhancement of the AMC LLC agreement, substantially all of the required payments ($51,000 has been paid as of December 31, 2006 and $23,000 is payable to Time Warner in 2007) attributable to AMC LLC were capitalized as deferred carriage fees and are being amortized as a reduction to revenue over the approximately 13 year life of the extended AMC LLC agreement.

Overview
We provide television programming principally to cable television system and DBS operators primarily throughout the United States.  We own three nationally distributed 24-hour entertainment programming networks:  AMC, WE tv (formerly WE: Women's Entertainment), and IFC.
general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers.
Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on
We earn revenues in two principal ways.  First, we receive affiliate fee payments principally from cable television system operators and DBS operators.  These revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis and earned under multi-year contracts with those operators referred to as affiliation agreements. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks but are generally based upon the number of each operator's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as "viewing subscribers."  The second principal source of revenues is from advertising.  Under our agreements with cable television system and DBS operators, we have the right to sell a specific amount of national advertising time on our programming networks.  Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees because most of our advertising is sold on a short-term basis, not under long-term contracts.  Also, our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services.
We seek to grow our revenues by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of viewing subscribers.  We refer to this as our "penetration."  AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than WE tv and IFC, which are not as widely distributed as AMC, a primarily analog service.  WE tv and IFC, although carried by many of the larger distributors, have higher growth opportunities due to their current penetration levels with cable television system operators.  IFC is currently carried primarily on digital tiers, while WE tv is carried on either analog expanded basic or digital tiers.  Therefore, WE tv and IFC penetration rates may increase if operators are successful in converting their analog subscribers to highly penetrated digital tiers of service. Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements.  In negotiating for increased or extended carriage, we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers or extended carriage, which we record as deferred carriage fees and which are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the

related subscriber guarantee, or to waive or accept lower per subscriber fees if certain additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.  We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the number of minutes of national advertising and by increasing rates for such advertising, but ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services.
Our principal goals are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our services.  To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high-quality, attractive programming.  Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television system and DBS operators because of the disparate bargaining power between us and the largest cable television system and DBS operators.  This increased concentration could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration.  In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of affiliation agreements.  The Company had three customers that in the aggregate accounted for approximately 32% and 35% of the Company's consolidated net trade receivable balances at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk.  These customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 39%, 40% and 41% of the Company's net revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Each of these customers accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's net revenues in 2006, 14%, 13% and 13% of the Company's net revenues in 2005, and 15%, 14% and 12% of the Company's net revenues in 2004.  Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliates would have a significant adverse impact on our business.
The Company classifies its business interests into two reportable segments:  AMC Networks (which comprises AMC and WE tv) and IFC.
Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets:
The Company's long-lived and indefinite-lived assets at December 31, 2006 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") of approximately $52.6 million, approximately $331.9 million of other long-lived intangible assets, approximately $19.9 million of property and equipment, net and approximately $352.1 million of long-term feature film inventory.  Such assets accounted for approximately 63% of the Company's consolidated total assets.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination.
For other long-lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value.
In assessing the recoverability of the Company's goodwill and other long-lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. These valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers used to determine affiliate fee revenue, access to programming and film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell-out rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges related to our long-lived assets.
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Company's reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite-lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the Company's reporting units.
Useful Lives of Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the July 2003 repurchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.'s ("MGM") 20% interest in each of American Movie Classics Company LLC ("AMC LLC"), WE: Women's Entertainment LLC ("WE LLC") and The Independent Film Channel LLC ("IFC LLC") and the repurchase of NBC's interests in Rainbow Media Holdings LLC in various transactions in 2001 and 2002. The Company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be 10 years for affiliation agreements and 7 to 10 years for advertiser

relationships. At December 31, 2006, the carrying values, net of accumulated amortization, were $277.5 million for affiliation agreements and $54.2 million for advertiser relationships.
The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements finite-lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and the related customer relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its major affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 10 years for affiliation agreements is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible asset.
There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals.
If an affiliate were to cease carrying a service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement intangible asset. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under "Impairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets" for the asset group containing that intangible. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2006 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization in the year ending December 31, 2007 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $4.8 million.
Feature Film Inventory and Related Obligations
Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then when the uncertainty is resolved. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on a straight-line basis over the respective license periods.  We periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, we would record a write-off for the portion of the unamortized
5
 
cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded an impairment loss of approximately $0.3 million included in technical and operating expense, representing the impairment of certain film inventory. No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.
Deferred Carriage Fees
Deferred carriage fees represent amounts principally paid or payable to cable system and DBS operators to guarantee carriage of certain programming services and are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the period of the related guarantee (2 to 13 years).
Certain Transactions
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In March 2005, $155.6 million of amounts due from Rainbow Media Holdings LLC was converted to equity and recorded as a deemed capital distribution.
In August 2004, AMC LLC issued 3.5 million shares of redeemable preferred membership interests with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350.0 million to Rainbow Media Holdings LLC, which was recorded as a deemed capital distribution.  In March 2005, the redeemable preferred membership interests were recontributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and converted back to common membership interests in AMC LLC.  The impact of the elimination was to reduce debt by $350.0 million and decrease member's deficiency by the same amount in 2005.
Cautionary Note Concerning Historical Financial Statements
In addition, our financial information does not necessarily reflect what our results of operations and financial position would have been if we had operated as an entity separate from Cablevision, our indirect parent, during the periods presented herein.
Investors should be aware that we are highly leveraged.  As a result, we incur significant interest charges.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2005
for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $44.1 million (8%) as compared to revenues for the prior year.  The net increase is attributable to the following:
Revenues, net
 
an increase in viewing subscribers and per subscriber rate increases.  Viewing subscribers as of December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005, increased 7.5% and 4.5% at IFC and AMC Networks, respectively.  Approximately half of the AMC Networks increase relates to the addition of Canadian viewing subscribers for the broadcast of AMC, which launched in September 2006 under its first Canadian affiliate agreement.
The increase in advertising revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year at AMC Networks resulted principally from higher unit rates and units sold.  The increase at IFC is due to increased event sponsorship sales related to programming aired on the network.  The increase in affiliate revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year is due to
 
 
The Company believes the WE tv and IFC programming services may benefit from increased distribution, especially on the digital tiers of cable television system operators as digital capacity continues to become available; and increased advertising revenues as cable networks, including ad-supported niche programming networks (such as WE tv), attract a greater advertising market share.  These increases could potentially be offset by lower net effective rates per viewing subscriber for our programming services due to the consolidation of cable television system operators and limited opportunities for increases in distribution for our substantially fully penetrated AMC programming service.  Changes in the viewership ratings of our AMC and WE tv programming services may also significantly affect future advertising revenues.
Our advertising revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year and we expect this trend to continue in 2007.

primarily include amortization of costs to license programming, including feature films, and programming and production costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense of fixed assets and definite lived intangibles is not included in technical and operating expenses but is presented as a separate operating expense.
Technical and operating expenses
Technical and operating expenses for 2006 increased $9.6 million (6%) compared to 2005.  The increase in technical and operating expense is attributed to the following:
 
We expect our programming costs to continue to increase in 2007.
As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased to 29% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 30% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
There may be significant changes in the level of our expenses from quarter to quarter and/or year to year due to content acquisitions and/or program development activities.  As additional competition for product increases from new programming services and alternate distribution technologies continue to develop in the industry, costs for film and other programming content may increase.
include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.0 million (15%) for 2006 as compared to 2005.  The increase is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
The increase in sales and marketing costs at AMC Networks and IFC primarily resulted from increased advertising sales related expenses due to increased advertising sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.  The increase in other general and administrative costs at AMC Networks and IFC is due to increased parent
10
 
company allocations for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year.  Management fees increased $1.2 million due to increased revenues of AMC Networks in 2006 compared to 2005.  Pursuant to an agreement with CSC Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision, AMC Networks pays an annual management fee of 3.5% of its revenues to CSC Holdings on a monthly basis.
Effective January 1, 2006, Cablevision adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ("Statement No. 123R").  Statement No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions, as Cablevision formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires that share-based payments be accounted for using a fair-value-based method.  As a result of the adoption of Statement No. 123R, the Company's proportionate share of Cablevision's share-based compensation expense for 2006 increased as compared to 2005.
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 28% in 2006 compared to 26% in 2005.
increased $0.5 million (less than 1%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. Amortization of intangible assets remained consistent for 2006 as compared to 2005.  An increase in depreciation expense of approximately $0.5 million during 2006 compared to the prior year primarily relates to the addition of a capitalized lease asset at AMC Networks during the year.
Depreciation and amortization
increased $4.1 million during 2006 compared to 2005.  The increase was attributable to $4.0 million of higher interest expense on bank debt.  Although bank debt outstanding decreased after the refinancing of our credit facility in July 2006, interest expense increased in 2006 due to higher variable interest rates.  Interest income decreased by $0.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower average cash balances.
Net interest expense
of $6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 represents costs written off in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement in July 2006.
Write-off of deferred financing costs
of $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, and state income taxes.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses and state taxes, partially offset by a $6.0 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in New York State tax law enacted in the second quarter of 2005.
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2004
for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $34.3 million (7%) as compared to revenues for the prior year.  The net increase is attributable to the following:

an increase in viewing subscribers and rate changes.  Viewing subscribers as of December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004, increased 7.8% and 1.6% at IFC and AMC Networks, respectively.  The decrease in affiliate revenue for AMC Networks resulted from lower effective rates in 2005 as compared to 2004.
The increase in advertising revenue at AMC Networks resulted principally from higher unit rates and units sold.  The increase at IFC is due to increased event sponsorship sales related to programming aired on the network.

decreased $4.9 million (3%) for 2005 as compared to 2004.  The net decrease is attributable to the following:
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
The decrease in sales and marketing costs at AMC Networks and IFC primarily resulted from decreased promotion of new programming.  The increase in other general and administrative costs primarily resulted from an increase in legal expenses (excluding investigation related legal expenses) of $1.6 million at AMC Networks compared to the same period in the prior year.  Management fees increased $1.1 million due to increased revenues at AMC Networks in 2005 compared to 2004.  Pursuant to an agreement with CSC Holdings, AMC Networks pays an annual management fee of 3.5% of its revenues to CSC Holdings on a monthly basis.
As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2005 compared to 2004.
decreased $10.7 million (15%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. A decrease of approximately $8.5 million during 2005 compared to the prior year, relates to the completed amortization in July 2004 of an intangible asset that AMC Networks originally recorded in 1994. Further, a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $2.2 million during 2005 compared to the prior year relates to fixed assets, of which $1.5 million relates to an AMC Networks capitalized lease asset which became fully amortized in 2004.
Depreciation and amortization
increased $76.0 million during 2005 compared to 2004.  The increase was attributable to $79.5 million of higher interest expense for the full year in 2005 on the notes that were issued and the bank debt that was borrowed in August 2004, partially offset by $3.5 million in increased interest income due to higher cash balances in 2005 compared to 2004.
Net interest expense
of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses and state taxes, partially offset by a $6.0 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a change in New York State tax law enacted in the second quarter of 2005.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense of $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, resulted primarily from pretax income, the impact of non-deductible expenses, state taxes and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview
The operations of the businesses that are included in our consolidated financial statements collectively have historically generated positive cash flow from operating activities.  However, each of our programming businesses has substantial programming, acquisition and development expenditure requirements.
We generated positive net cash from operating activities in each of the three years ended December 31, 2006.  We currently expect our funding requirements for the next twelve months to be met by our cash on hand, cash from operations and available borrowings under our new credit facility entered into in July 2006 (see discussion below).  In addition, our cash on hand, plus cash flow from operations, plus proceeds from borrowings available to us, provides the capital required for net funding and investment requirements of other Rainbow programming services that we do not own, including the VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow's regional news networks ("News 12 Networks") and fuse, subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in our financing agreements.  During the year ended December 31, 2006, we distributed $168.8 million to Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, our direct parent, to, among other things, fund other Rainbow programming services, including the VOOM HD Networks, News 12 Networks and fuse.
The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, the present value of capital leases, interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006:
 
Total amounts payable by the Company in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2006 and thereafter, including capital leases and related interest, as of December 31, 2006 are as follows:

Debt Financing Agreements
On July 5, 2006, we entered into an $800 million senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), which consists of a $500 million term A loan facility and a $300 million revolving credit facility.  The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012.  The Credit Agreement allows us to utilize up to $50 million of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5 million for a swing loan.  Further, the Credit Agreement provides for an incremental facility of up to a maximum of $925 million, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100 million.  If an incremental facility is established, we and the lenders will enter into a supplement to the Credit Agreement with terms and conditions that are no more restrictive than those in the Credit Agreement.  There are no commitments from the lenders to fund the incremental facility.
On July 5, 2006, we borrowed the entire $500 million term A loan facility and $10 million under the revolving credit facility. We used the $510 million borrowed under the Credit Agreement and approximately $88 million of additional available cash to repay all of our outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due under our August 2004 $950 million senior secured credit facility of which $592.5 million was outstanding under a term loan at July 5, 2006 (scheduled to mature March 31, 2012) and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement. We may use future borrowings under the Credit Agreement to make investments, distributions and other payments permitted under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid without penalty at any time.   Outstanding borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility at February 23, 2007 were $500 million and $10 million, respectively.  We had $290 million in undrawn revolver commitments at February 23, 2007.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are our direct obligations which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of our subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC.  Such borrowings are secured by the pledge of our stock and the stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries and all of our other assets and the assets of substantially all of our subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The interest rate under the Credit Agreement varies, depending on our cash flow ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), from 1.0% to 1.5% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar-based borrowings and from zero to 0.5% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the term A loan facility and the revolving credit facility was 6.62% and 6.60%, respectively.  The $500 million term A loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original outstanding balance ($6.25 million) from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2010, 2.5% of the original outstanding balance ($12.5 million) from March 31, 2011 until December 31, 2012, and 32.5% of the original outstanding balance ($162.5 million) on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the term A loan maturity date.  Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012.
The financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 1.75 to 1, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the
15
 
Credit Agreement) of 6.75 to 1.00 through June 30, 2008, decreasing thereafter to 6.25 to 1, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 5.50 to 1.  Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates.
We are obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn revolver commitment.
In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into in July 2006, we incurred deferred financing costs of approximately $5.5 million which are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement.  We recorded $6.1 million as a write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the August 2004 credit facility in July 2006.
Our notes outstanding consist of $300 million principal amount of 8-3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500 million principal amount of 10-3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014.  These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries.
We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2006.
Future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by our credit ratings, which are provided by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") and Standard & Poor's.  Key factors in the assessment of our credit ratings include our free cash flow generating capacity, fiscal strategy, enterprise value and industry risk.  Our corporate credit rating is B1 with a stable outlook by Moody's and BB with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's.  Any future downgrade to our credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds.
Debt Covenant Compliance
In December 2005, the Company determined that there were certain technical covenant violations under its prior credit facility entered into in August 2004.  The Company received a waiver from the lenders under the August 2004 credit facility and entered into an amendment of such credit facility.  On January 31, 2006, Cablevision announced that these covenant violations had been cured and the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its debt instruments.
CASH FLOW DISCUSSION
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $126.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The 2006 cash provided by operating activities resulted from $243.0 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non-cash items, partially offset by a net decrease in cash resulting from the purchase of feature film inventory and original programming licenses totaling $126.1 million, a decrease in cash resulting from an increase in deferred carriage fees of $8.8 million, and a decrease in cash resulting from a net decrease in current and non-current deferred carriage fees

Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $5.2 million compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The 2006 and 2005 investing activities consisted of capital expenditures.  The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 primarily relates to the purchase of technical equipment for cable television systems and DBS operators to migrate to and receive a digital feed from an analog feed for the transmission of our networks.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $153.0 million.  The 2004 investing activities consisted of advances to affiliates of $152.0 million and $1.0 million of capital expenditures.

On October 24, 2005, Cablevision received a letter from the Dolan Family Group withdrawing the June 19, 2005 proposal.
On October 8, 2006, Cablevision received a proposal from the Dolan Family Group (the "Dolan Family Group Proposal") to acquire, at a purchase price of $27.00 per share in cash, all of the outstanding shares of Cablevision's common stock, except for the shares held by the Dolan Family Group.  The Dolan Family Group Proposal contemplated that substantially all of the purchase price would be funded by the incurrence of additional indebtedness by Cablevision, CSC Holdings, the Company and several other subsidiaries of Cablevision and CSC Holdings.
Cablevision's Board of Directors appointed a special transaction committee (the "Committee") of independent directors to review the proposal. The Committee retained Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as its legal counsel, and Lehman Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors
.
On January 12, 2007, the Committee received a letter from Charles F. Dolan and James L.

There can be no assurances that the Dolan Family Group will not propose, undertake or consummate a similar transaction in the future.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED
In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ("Statement No. 159").  Statement No. 159 permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.  An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred.  Statement No. 159 is effective as of January 1, 2008 for the Company.  Early adoption is permitted, but an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying Statement No. 159, unless it chooses early adoption of Statement No. 157 and Statement No. 159. Statement No. 159 also applies to eligible items existing at January 1, 2008 (or when the date of early adoption occurs).
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("Statement No. 157"). Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under Statement No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to

  Statement No. 157 will be effective for financial statements issued with fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 157 will have on our financial statements.
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts.  It also clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.  Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurements, however, for some entities, the application of Statement No. 157 could change current practices.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ("FIN 48").  This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Any change in the net assets and liabilities recognized as a result of applying the provisions of FIN 48 would be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of member's deficiency.  FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.  We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
