In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (the "") may have liability to any indemnified party (the "") hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim promptly but in no event more than 10 Business Days following receipt of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party's failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not (except as stated in Section 7.1(a)(iii) or 7.2(a)(iii) with respect to the survival of representations and warranties and the right to claim thereunder) preclude it from seeking indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend as provided herein (in which event the Indemnified Party's right to indemnity will be reduced equitably to reflect such material prejudice). The Indemnifying Party shall promptly following notice of the claim from the Indemnified Party (but in any case 10 Business Days before the due date for the answer or response to a claim) notify the Indemnified Party of its desire to defend such claim. In the event the Indemnifying Party so notifies the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such claim at its own expense and by counsel of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if the

Indemnifying Party reasonably believes that it is likely that all or a material portion of the claim is subject to indemnification hereunder by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such claim by counsel of its own choosing; that if the Indemnified Party shall reasonably conclude that (a) there is a material conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such claim or (b) there are specific defenses or claims available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party and which could be materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party, then the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to direct or control the defense of such claim if (x) the Indemnified Party waives all right to indemnification it may have in respect of such claim under this Article VII, (y) the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against such claim or (z) the Indemnifying Party fails to defend against such claim after notice to such effect has been given by the Indemnified Party and the opportunity to cure has occurred. Unless the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of a claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the authority on behalf of the Indemnified Party to settle any such claim (with the Indemnifying Party being responsible for all costs and expenses of such settlement); that the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (i) such settlement releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, (ii) such settlement shall not permit any order, injunction or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or indirectly, against the Indemnified Party, and (iii) there is no admission by the Indemnified Party of any liability or of any violation of Applicable Law. Each party shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control the defense of any claim (and shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such claim) to the extent the claim (A) seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that would materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party and the equitable relief is the only relief being sought, or (B) involves an allegation of criminal conduct against the Indemnified Party. No settlement of any claim may be made by the Indemnified Party without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
