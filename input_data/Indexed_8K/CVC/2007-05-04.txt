Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007.
Bethpage, N.Y., May 3, 2007
First quarter consolidated net revenue grew 12.5% to just under $1.6 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and Madison Square Garden.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) increased 21.4% to $481.6 million and consolidated operating income grew 69.7% to $176.0 million.
Operating highlights for the first quarter 2007 include:
Cable Television net revenue growth of 15.4% and AOCF growth of 12.6% as compared to Q1 2006
                 
Twelfth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains; 2.4% growth from Q1 2006
                 
Quarterly Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") growth of more than 260,000 new video, high-speed data and voice units
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $116.95 in the first quarter 2007
                 
Madison Square Garden AOCF growth of $10.7 million over the prior year period
                 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision had a solid start to 2007, driven primarily by continuing growth in the company's cable operations as well as AOCF growth at Madison Square Garden and Rainbow Media.  Our success in cable continues to be driven by the strength of our video, voice and data services, which maintained their industry-leading penetration rates.  The company delivered its 12th consecutive quarter of basic subscriber growth while our digital video service reached a penetration rate of 80 percent," concluded Mr. Dolan.

Results from Continuing Operations

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded, fiber-delivered commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the first quarter 2007 rose 14.9% to $1,141.3 million, AOCF grew 12.3% to $428.6 million and operating income increased 22.6% to $185.5 million, all compared to the prior year period.
Cable Television
Cable Television first quarter 2007 net revenues increased 15.4% to $1,099.3 million, AOCF rose 12.6% to $414.1 million and operating income increased 20.8% to $190.9 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The increases in net revenue, AOCF and operating income resulted principally from growth in video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the addition of over 1.2 million Revenue Generating Units since the first quarter of 2006.
Highlights include:
customers up 12,000 or 0.4% from December 2006 and 73,000 or 2.4% from March 2006; twelfth consecutive quarter of basic video subscriber gains
                 
Basic video
customers up 65,000 or 2.6% from December 2006 and 384,000 or 18.1% from March 2006
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 78,000 or 3.8% from December 2006 and 311,000 or 17.2% from March 2006
                 
Optimum Online
high-speed data
customers up 109,000 or 9.0% from December 2006 and 453,000 or 52.4% from March 2006
                 
Optimum Voice
up 261,000 or 3.0% from December 2006 and 1,216,000 or 15.4% from March 2006
                 
Revenue Generating Units
of $116.95, up $1.65 or 1.4% from the fourth quarter of 2006 and $12.71 or 12.2% from the first quarter of 2006
                 
Cable
Television RPS
Lightpath
For first quarter 2007, Lightpath net revenues decreased 1.8% to $53.0 million, AOCF grew 3.6% to $14.5 million and operating loss decreased 19.8% to $5.5 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The decrease in net revenue is primarily attributable to reduced intrasegment revenue partially offset by the growth in Ethernet data services.  The improvement in AOCF and operating loss were a direct result of certain efficiencies related to the migration from traditional data service to Ethernet data service, offset in part by higher sales and marketing costs in 2007.
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our National Programming services - AMC, IFC and WE tv as well as Other Programming which includes: FSN Bay Area, fuse, Lifeskool, Sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
Rainbow net revenues for the first quarter of 2007 increased 11.4% to $230.1 million and AOCF rose 76.5% to $49.0 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Operating income improved to $15.8 million as compared to a first quarter 2006 operating loss of $4.0 million.
AMC/IFC/WE tv
First quarter 2007 net revenues of the combined National Services grew 8.8% to $158.3 million, AOCF rose 28.7% to $75.7 million and operating income rose 40.8% to $57.6 million, each compared to the prior year period.
The first quarter 2007 results reflect:
A 16.2% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher sellout rates at AMC
                 
See notes on page 4
2
Viewing subscriber increases of 7.7% at IFC, 4.6% at WE tv and 7.2% at AMC (AMC's growth includes 3.2 million new Canadian subscribers), all compared to March 2006
                 
A 4.4% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period, including a $2.5 million increase in Canadian affiliate revenue
                 
A 6.2% reduction in operating expenses compared with the prior year period, principally due to the timing of marketing costs in 2007
                 
Other Programming
First quarter 2007 net revenues rose 15.6% to $77.1 million, AOCF deficit decreased 14.0% to $26.7 million and operating loss declined 6.8% to $41.9 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher revenue at the VOOM HD Networks and regional sports and news.  The improvement in both AOCF and operating loss is principally the result of the favorable revenue impact offset in part by higher programming costs.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex, Radio City Music Hall, and the Beacon Theatre.
Madison Square Garden's first quarter 2007 net revenue increased 5.2% to $235.6 million, AOCF increased $10.7 million to $17.6 million and operating loss declined 91.5% to $1.1 million, all compared to the prior year period.
MSG's first quarter 2007 results were primarily impacted by:
Improved results from MSG's professional teams, with $2.2 million higher revenues and $8.0 million lower team operating expenses (primarily related to lower team personnel compensation and luxury tax)
                 
Improved MSG Networks results, including a $5.7 million increase in affiliate revenue which more than offset a $1.8 million reduction in other revenues, primarily advertising, and $3.3 million of higher operating costs
                 
Improved results from the entertainment business, as revenues from events increased $5.7 million, more than offsetting the increase in variable event related costs and the operating costs of a new venue, the Beacon Theatre.
                 
Other Matters
On April 30, 2007, Cablevision announced an agreement to sell its 60% interest in FSN Bay Area and its 50% interest in FSN New England to Comcast Corporation for $570 million in cash.  This transaction is subject to certain closing conditions.
On May 2, 2007, Cablevision announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with an entity created by members of the Dolan Family Group, pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Cablevision that the Dolan Family Group does not own will be converted into $36.26 per share in cash.  Based on the recommendation of the Special Transaction Committee, Cablevision's Board of Directors, including independent directors, voted to approve the transaction.  The transaction requires approval by holders of a majority of Cablevision's outstanding Class A shares not held by the Dolan Family Group or Cablevision's directors and executive officers.  The transaction is also subject to certain regulatory approvals, the receipt of funds pursuant to already committed financing and other customary closing conditions.

2007 Outlook

Notes:
Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to the detailed definition of AOCF and discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure below and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Operating results of FSN Chicago and Rainbow DBS' distribution operations are included in discontinued operations.
2.
              
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow From Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
