     WHEREAS, Lessor has agreed to lease the Aircraft, with flight crew, to Lessee on a "time sharing" basis as defined in Section 91.501(c)(1) of the Federal Aviation Regulations ("FAR") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and the covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, Lessor and Lessee, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
     1. . Lessor agrees to lease the Aircraft to Lessee pursuant to the provisions of FAR Section 91.501(b)(6) and Section 91.501(c)(1) and this Agreement, and to provide a fully-qualified and credentialed flight crew for all flights to be conducted hereunder during the Term (as defined in Section 13) hereof. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement did not result in any way from any direct or indirect advertising, holding out or soliciting on the part of Lessor or any person purportedly acting on behalf of Lessor. Lessor and Lessee intend that the lease of the Aircraft effected by this Agreement shall be treated as a "wet lease" pursuant to which Lessor provides transportation services to Lessee in accordance with FAR Section 91.501(b)(6) and Section 91.501(c)(1).
Lease of Aircraft
     2. . Lessee shall pay Lessor the following actual expenses of each flight conducted under this Agreement (i.e. non-business flights for which reimbursement is required in accordance with Lessor's policies), not to exceed the maximum amount legally payable for such flight under FAR Section 91.501(d)(1)-(10):

Lessor shall have complete and exclusive responsibility for scheduling, dispatching and flight following of the Aircraft on all flights conducted under this Agreement, which responsibility includes the sole and exclusive right over initiating, conducting and terminating such flights. Lessee shall have no responsibility for scheduling, dispatching or flight following on any flight conducted under this Agreement, nor any right over initiating, conducting or terminating any such flight. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed so as to convey to Lessee any operational control over, or possession, command and control of, the Aircraft, all of which are expressly retained by Lessor.

     (a) Lessee will provide Lessor with requests for flight time and proposed flight schedules as far in advance of any given flight as possible. Lessee or the designated authorized representative(s) of Lessee shall submit scheduling requests under this Agreement to the designated authorized representative(s) of Lessor. Requests for flight time shall be in such form (whether oral or written) mutually convenient to, and agreed upon by, the parties. In addition to proposed schedules and flight times, Lessee shall upon request provide Lessor with
 
the following information for each proposed flight prior to scheduled departure: (i) proposed departure point; (ii) destination; (iii) date and time of flight; (iv) the number of anticipated passengers; (v) the nature and extent of luggage to be carried; (vi) the date and time of a return flight, if any; and (vii) any other pertinent information concerning the proposed flight that Lessor or the flight crew may request.
     (b) Subject to Aircraft and crew availability and to any usage limitations established by Lessor, Lessor shall use its good faith efforts, consistent with Lessor's approved policies, in order to accommodate the needs of Lessee, to avoid conflicts in scheduling, and to enable Lessee to enjoy the benefits of this Agreement; however, Lessee acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Lessor shall have sole and exclusive final authority over the scheduling of the Aircraft; and (ii) the needs of Lessor for the Aircraft shall take precedence over Lessee's rights and Lessor's obligations under this Agreement.
     (c) Although every good faith effort shall be made to avoid its occurrence, any flight scheduled under this Agreement is subject to cancellation by either party without incurring liability to the other party. In the event that cancellation is necessary, the canceling party shall provide the maximum notice practicable.
     5. . As soon as practicable after the end of each flight or trip, Lessor shall provide to Lessee an invoice detailing all amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to Section 2 with respect to such flight or trip, including such detail supporting all expenses paid or incurred by Lessor for which reimbursement is sought as Lessee may reasonably request. Lessee shall pay all amounts due to Lessor under this Section 5 not later than 30 days after receipt of the invoice therefor.

     (a) Lessor shall employ or engage and pay all salaries, benefits and and/or compensation for a fully-qualified flight crew with appropriate credentials to conduct each flight undertaken under this Agreement.

All flight crewmembers shall be included on any insurance policies that Lessor is required to maintain hereunder.
 
     (b) The qualified flight crew provided by Lessor shall exercise all of its duties and responsibilities with regard to the safety of each flight conducted hereunder in accordance with applicable FAR's. The Aircraft shall be operated under the standards and policies established by Lessor. Final authority to initiate or terminate each flight, and otherwise to decide all matters relating to the safety of any given flight or requested flight, shall rest with the pilot-in-command of that flight. The flight crew may, in its sole discretion, terminate any flight, refuse to commence any flight, or take any other action that, in the judgment of the pilot-in-command, is necessitated by considerations of safety. No such termination or refusal to commence by the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability for loss, injury, damage or delay in favor of Lessee or any other person. Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee or any other person for loss, injury or damage occasioned by the delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and flight crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason.
     8. .

Each such policy shall be primary insurance, not subject to any co-insurance clause and shall be without right of contribution from any other insurance.
     (c) Lessor shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide such additional insurance coverage for specific flights under this Agreement, if any, as Lessee may request in writing. Lessee also acknowledges that any trips scheduled to the European Union require Lessor to purchase additional insurance to comply with local regulations. The cost of all additional flight-specific insurance shall be borne by Lessee as set forth in Section 2(d) hereof.
     (d) Each party agrees that it will not do any act or voluntarily suffer or permit any act to be done whereby any insurance required hereunder shall or may be suspended, impaired or defeated. In no event shall Lessor suffer or permit the Aircraft to be used or operated
