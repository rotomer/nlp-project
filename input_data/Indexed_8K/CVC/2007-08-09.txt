Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Bethpage, N.Y., August 8, 2007
increased 10.4% to $508.5 million and consolidated operating income grew 30.5% to $208.4 million.  In the second quarter of 2006, AOCF and operating income included a reduction in expenses of $26.5 million relating to the resolution of a contractual programming dispute.  Excluding the impact of this 2006 item, the company's second quarter AOCF and operating income would have increased 17.1% and 56.4%, respectively.
Second quarter consolidated net revenue grew 12.3% to $1.568 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in each of its three operating segments - Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and Madison Square Garden.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")(1)
Operating metrics for the second quarter 2007 include:
Cable Television net revenue growth of 13.0% compared to Q2 2006
                
Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") growth of 168,000 new digital video, high-speed data and voice units, and a loss of 348 basic video subscribers in the quarter
                
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $121.01 in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of $4.06 for the three month period
                
Madison Square Garden AOCF improvement of more than 80% to $32.5 million in the second quarter of 2007
                
Rainbow National Services AOCF growth of 28.8% over the prior year period
                
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision performed well in the second quarter thanks to strong revenue and cash flow growth across our cable operations, Madison Square Garden and Rainbow Media.  Our bundle of advanced digital video, Internet and voice products continues to be successful in attracting new customers and expanding existing subscriber relationships.  Cablevision's Optimum Voice service, recently honored by J.D. Power, now reaches 30% of the homes passed by our fiber-rich network, and the penetration rates of all of our consumer telecom services continue to lead the cable industry," concluded Mr. Dolan.
Results from Continuing Operations(2)
Segment results for the quarters ended June 30, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
Adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Please refer to page 4 for a more detailed definition of AOCF and discussion of our use of AOCF as a non-GAAP financial measure and page 6 for a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss) and net income (loss).

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the second quarter 2007 rose 12.8% to $1,182.8 million, AOCF grew 3.8% to $455.8 million and operating income increased 7.6% to $213.3 million, all compared to the prior year period.  In the second quarter of 2006, AOCF and operating income included a reduction in expenses of $26.5 million relating to the resolution of a contractual programming dispute.  Excluding the impact of this item, second quarter AOCF and operating income would have increased 10.5% and 24.2%, respectively.
Cable Television 
Cable Television second quarter 2007 net revenues increased 13.0% to $1,139.5 million, AOCF rose 4.2% to $440.9 million and operating income increased 7.6% to $218.3 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The increases in net revenue, AOCF and operating income resulted principally from growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the net addition of nearly 1.0 million Revenue Generating Units since the second quarter of 2006.  Second quarter 2006 Cable Television results include the $26.5 million expense reduction discussed above.  Excluding this item, second quarter AOCF and operating income would have increased 11.2% and 23.8%, respectively.
The second quarter 2007 results reflect:
customers essentially flat for the quarter and up 38,000 or 1.2% from June 2006
                
Basic video
customers up 39,000 or 1.6% from March 2007 and 279,000 or 12.3% from June 2006
                
iO: Interactive Optimum
digital video
customers up 50,000 or 2.4% from March 2007 and 277,000 or 14.6% from June 2006
                
Optimum Online
high-speed data
customers up 81,000 or 6.1% from March 2007 and 412,000 or 41.7% from June 2006
                
Optimum Voice
up 168,000 or 1.8% from March 2007 and 999,000 or 12.1% from June 2006

Cable
Television RPS
Lightpath
For second quarter 2007, Lightpath net revenues decreased 3.5% to $51.1 million, AOCF declined 7.5% to $14.8 million and operating loss increased 9.0% to $5.0 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The decrease in net revenue is primarily attributable to reduced intrasegment revenue, partially offset by the growth in Ethernet data services.  The decrease in AOCF and increase in operating loss were due principally to increases in operating expenses related to growth in the Ethernet business.
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our National Programming services - AMC, IFC and WE tv as well as Other Programming which includes:  News 12 Networks, VOOM HD Networks, fuse, Lifeskool, Sportskool, IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
Rainbow net revenues for the second quarter of 2007 increased 11.9% to $222.3 million and AOCF rose 70.8% to $39.9 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Operating income improved to $9.7 million as compared to a second quarter 2006 operating loss of $8.5 million.
AMC/IFC/WE tv
Second quarter 2007 net revenues of the combined Rainbow National Services grew 9.9% to $166.8 million, AOCF rose 28.8% to $74.2 million and operating income rose 42.5% to $56.0 million, each compared to the prior year period.

The second quarter 2007 results reflect:
An 11.6% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher CPMs (cost per thousand) and increased sellout rates at AMC
                
Viewing subscriber increases of 8.0% at IFC, 4.4% at WE tv and 6.6% at AMC (AMC's growth is primarily attributable to 3.3 million new Canadian subscribers), all compared to June 2006
                
A 9.4% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                
Lower contractual rights expense partially offset by an increase in other operating costs compared with the prior year period
                
Other Programming
For second quarter 2007, net revenues rose 16.2% to $60.8 million, AOCF deficit remained flat at $34.3 million and operating loss declined 3.0% to $46.3 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher affiliate revenue at the VOOM HD Networks.  The improvement in operating loss is primarily the result of the favorable revenue impact at VOOM HD Networks, offset in part by higher program acquisition and distribution costs principally at IFC Entertainment.
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, MSG Entertainment, the MSG Arena complex, Radio City Music Hall, and the Beacon Theatre.
Madison Square Garden's second quarter 2007 net revenue grew 12.5% to $182.4 million, AOCF increased $14.5 million to $32.5 million and operating income improved to $14.2 million as compared to a second quarter 2006 operating loss of $0.4 million.
MSG's second quarter reflects improved results in a number of areas, including:
MSG's professional teams, with an $8.0 million increase in revenues and a $6.6 million reduction in team operating expenses (primarily related to increased playoff revenues and expenses, and lower team personnel compensation and luxury tax)
                
MSG Networks with a $6.2 million increase in affiliate revenue, which more than offset a $1.1 million reduction in other revenues (primarily advertising) and a $1.8 million increase in operating costs
                
MSG's entertainment business, with a $7.3 million increase in revenue from events, which more than offset the increase in event related costs and the operating costs of a new venue, the Beacon Theatre.
                
Other Matters
On June 30, 2007, Rainbow Media Holdings completed the  sale of its 60% interest in FSN Bay Area and its 50% interest in FSN New England to Comcast Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $570 million, plus certain additional consideration, subject to customary working capital adjustments.  The results of FSN Bay Area have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.
On May 2, 2007, Cablevision announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with an entity created by members of the Dolan Family Group, pursuant to which all outstanding shares of Cablevision that the Dolan Family Group does not own will be converted into $36.26 per share in cash.  Based on the recommendation of the Special Transaction Committee, Cablevision's Board of Directors, including independent directors, voted to approve the transaction.  The transaction requires approval by holders of a majority of Cablevision's outstanding Class A shares not held by the Dolan Family Group or Cablevision's directors and executive officers.  The transaction is also subject to certain regulatory approvals, the receipt of funds pursuant to committed financing and other customary closing conditions.

2007 Outlook
The company updates full year 2007 guidance as outlined below which reflects actual second quarter results and the expectation that the company will remain in a competitive environment:
As previously released on May 3, 2007
(a)
                     
Percentage growth rate (2007 as compared to 2006)
(b)
                    
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with other titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with other titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow From Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary items.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
