Bethpage, N.Y., February 28, 2008
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
 
Fourth quarter consolidated net revenue grew 10.8% to $1.842 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and Madison Square Garden.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) increased 20.4% to $610.2 million and consolidated operating income grew 62.9% to $330.3 million.
 
For the full year 2007, consolidated net revenue increased 11.3% to $6.484 billion, driven by the addition of 798,000 Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") during the year in Telecommunications Services combined with revenue growth at Rainbow and Madison Square Garden.  Consolidated AOCF grew 16.8% to $2.087 billion and consolidated operating income increased 54.7% to $911.1 million for full year 2007.
 
Operating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 include:
 
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 8.6% and 11.6% and AOCF growth of 13.3% and 9.6% for the quarter and full year, respectively
                 
Quarterly addition of 208,000 Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") including new basic and digital video, high-speed data and voice units
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $125.10 in the fourth quarter 2007

Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision had a good fourth quarter and a strong 2007 with annual double-digit revenue and AOCF growth.  Our cable operations helped drive this year's performance with strong subscriber increases in digital video, voice and data, which ensured that Cablevision maintained its industry-leading penetration rates.  Also fueling our success in 2007 was Rainbow Media and MSG, which both delivered double-digit increases in revenue and AOCF for the full year.  With our businesses performing well, we are confident in our prospects going forward," concluded Mr. Dolan.

Cable Television
Cable Television fourth quarter 2007 net revenues increased 8.6% to $1.172 billion, AOCF rose 13.3% to $478.6 million and operating income increased 32.6% to $266.7 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The increases in net revenue, AOCF and operating income resulted principally from growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers, which is reflected in the net addition of 798,000 Revenue Generating Units since the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
The fourth quarter 2007 results reflect:
                 
Basic video
customers up 1,000 from September 2007 and down less than 4,000 or 0.1% from December 2006
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
customers up 43,000 or 1.7% from September 2007 and 181,000 or 7.4% from December 2006
digital video
                 
Optimum Online
customers up 62,000 or 2.8% from September 2007 and 243,000 or 11.9% from December 2006
high-speed data

Television RPS
 
Optimum Lightpath

The increase in net revenue is primarily attributable to the solid growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by the effect of the transition from traditional data service.  The improvements in AOCF and operating income were due principally to the continued expansion of the more efficient, higher margin Ethernet business.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of our National Programming services - AMC, WE tv and IFC as well as Other Programming which includes:  News 12 Networks, VOOM HD, fuse, Lifeskool, sportskool, IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.  Beginning January 1, 2008, fuse will be reported within the Madison Square Garden segment.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 14.2% to $243.9 million, AOCF rose 9.0% to $49.4 million, and operating income increased 86.5% to $25.4 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
Full year 2007 net revenue rose 13.6% to $894.4 million, AOCF grew 44.1% to $182.3 million and operating income increased $66.5 million to $70.2 million, all compared to 2006.
 
AMC/WE tv/IFC
Fourth quarter 2007 net revenues of the combined national services grew 12.1% to $179.3 million, AOCF decreased 4.8% to $79.7 million and operating income declined 1.0% to $64.7 million, each compared to the prior year period.
 
The fourth quarter 2007 results reflect:
                 
A 14.7% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher overall cash sellout rates at AMC and WE tv
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 11.2% at IFC, 8.5% at WE tv and 4.1% at AMC, all compared to December 2006
                 
A 10.0% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
A 33.4% increase in operating costs, as compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increased programming and marketing costs at AMC and WE tv
 
Other Programming
Fourth quarter 2007 net revenues rose 19.6% to $70.3 million, AOCF deficit improved 21.0% to $30.4 million and operating loss declined 24.0% to $39.3 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher affiliate revenue at VOOM HD.  The AOCF and operating loss improvements were primarily the result of the favorable revenue impact at VOOM HD, partially offset by higher operating costs primarily at fuse and IFC Films.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Network, FSN New York, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty, and MSG Entertainment.  Its operations include the MSG Arena, the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre and the Chicago Theatre.
 
Madison Square Garden's fourth quarter 2007 net revenue increased 18.3% to $401.9 million, AOCF increased 62.2% to $87.0 million and operating income grew 102.8% to $71.5 million all compared to fourth quarter 2006.
 
MSG's fourth quarter 2007 results, as compared with fourth quarter 2006, were primarily impacted by:
                 
MSG's entertainment business, as revenue from entertainment events increased $52.9 million, more than offsetting a $39.8 million increase in costs related to those events.
                 
MSG's professional teams, including $22.5 million of lower net provisions for certain team personnel transactions and $3.7 million in higher sports team related revenue, partly offset by $6.1 million of higher other team operating expenses
                 
MSG Networks' results, including a $6.0 million increase in affiliate revenue which more than offset $1.1 million of higher operating costs
                 
Higher venue operating costs of $1.1 million, including the impact of the addition of two new venues.
 
Madison Square Garden's full year 2007 net revenue increased 11.2% to $950.1 million, AOCF grew 103.5% to $147.3 million and operating income increased $80.5 million to $78.5 million, all as compared to the prior year.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenue and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
