Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
On May 11, 2008, CSC Holdings, Inc. ("CSC Holdings") entered into a Formation Agreement with Tribune Company to form a new limited liability company ("Newsday LLC").  Under the terms of the Formation Agreement, Tribune Company, through its subsidiaries, will contribute the Newsday business (the "Newsday Media Group Business") and CSC Holdings will contribute newly issued Senior Notes of Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") with a fair market value of $650 million on the contribution date. 
 
Also on the contribution date, Newsday LLC will borrow $650 million under a new secured credit facility, and Tribune Company will receive $630 million in cash from the proceeds of that financing (which includes the $18 million of prepaid rent mentioned below).  CSC Holdings will provide funds to Newsday LLC to pay certain transaction costs. 
 
As a result of these transactions, CSC Holdings, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, will own approximately 97% and Tribune Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, will own approximately 3% of the equity in Newsday LLC.  CSC Holdings will have operational control of Newsday LLC. 
 
The Newsday Media Group Business was valued at $632 million in the transaction, and Tribune Company will also receive $18 million at closing as prepaid rent under certain leases of property used in the business, bringing the total transaction value to $650 million.
 
The debt securities contributed by CSC Holdings will have terms which mirror Cablevision's 8% Senior Notes due 2012.  Bank of America has provided a firm financing commitment with respect to the $650 million of financing to be raised by Newsday LLC.  Under the commitment letter from Bank of America, borrowings by Newsday LLC will be guaranteed by CSC Holdings and secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday LLC, including the Cablevision Senior Notes contributed by CSC Holdings.  Tribune Company has agreed to indemnify CSC Holdings with respect to any payments that CSC Holdings makes under its guarantee of the Newsday LLC financing.  Newsday LLC will generally be prohibited from using the proceeds received from any repayment of the Cablevision Senior Notes contributed by CSC Holdings to acquire non-publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings, and Newsday LLC will be required under the financing agreements to maintain cash or cash equivalents or publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings with an aggregate principal amount that exceeds the then-outstanding borrowings by Newsday LLC.
 
CSC Holdings and Tribune Company will enter into a Tax Matters Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, CSC Holdings will agree that it will indemnify Tribune Company for certain taxes incurred by Tribune Company if, prior to January 1, 2018, Newsday LLC sells or otherwise disposes of the Newsday Media Group Business contributed by Tribune Company or fails to maintain outstanding indebtedness in specified minimum amounts over time (reducing to $335 million on January 1, 2018).
 
At any time after the tenth anniversary of the closing of the transaction and prior to the thirteenth anniversary of the closing, CSC Holdings will have the right to purchase Tribune Company's entire interest in Newsday LLC.  At any time after the thirteenth anniversary of the closing and on or prior to the date that is six months after such anniversary, Tribune Company will have the right to require CSC Holdings to purchase Tribune Company's entire interest in Newsday LLC.  In either case, the purchase price will be the fair market value of the interest.
 
Consummation of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
 
 
 
The Formation Agreement, the form of Tax Matters Agreement and the form of Limited Liability Company Agreement of Newsday LLC have been filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the descriptions of those agreements in this Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to those exhibits.

Adjustment
 
On or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Tribune Parties shall:  (i) determine the Estimated Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Debt; (ii) deliver to Cablevision Parties a written statement (the "") setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation by Tribune Parties thereof and the computations used in connection therewith; and (iii) in the event that there is a Working Capital Excess and it is greater than the Estimated Closing Debt, then Tribune will also identify the Excluded Accounts Receivable in the Preliminary Statement.  The Preliminary Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions of Estimated Closing Working Capital and Estimated Closing Debt and the definitions included in such definitions.
(a)
                                 
Preliminary Statement
 
Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Cablevision Parties may, at their option, prepare and deliver to Tribune Parties a written statement (the "") setting forth in reasonable detail their calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and the computations used in connection therewith.  If Cablevision Parties do not deliver a Statement within such 90-day period then the Preliminary Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties.  The Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and the definitions included in such definitions.  During the 30-day period following the receipt by Tribune Parties of the Statement, Tribune Parties and their Representatives shall be permitted to review during normal business hours and make copies reasonably required of (i) the working papers of Cablevision Parties and, if relevant, their independent auditors relating to the preparation of the Statement (but only after Tribune Parties and their Representatives shall have provided to such independent auditors any customary indemnities and waivers that such independent auditors shall request) and (ii) any supporting schedules, supporting analyses and other supporting documentation and underlying data relating to the preparation of the Statement.  The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth day following delivery thereof, except to the extent that Tribune Parties shall, at their option (and without any obligation to do so), give written notice of disagreement with the Statement (the "") to Cablevision Parties prior to such date.  Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent it is at the time reasonably possible to do so, the nature of any disagreement so asserted (any such disagreement to be limited to whether such calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt are mathematically correct and/or have been prepared in accordance with the definitions of Closing

Statement
Notice of Disagreement
Working Capital and Closing Debt, and the definitions included in such definitions).  If a Notice of Disagreement complying with the preceding sentence is received by Cablevision Parties in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (I) or (II) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (I) the date Cablevision Parties and Tribune Parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (II) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.
 
During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement that complies with the preceding paragraph, Cablevision Parties and Tribune Parties shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.  During such period, Cablevision Parties and their independent auditors shall be permitted to review and make copies reasonably required of (i) the working papers of Tribune Parties and, if relevant, the designated independent auditors (if any) of Tribune Parties relating to the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement (but only after Cablevision Parties and their Representatives shall have provided to such independent auditors any customary indemnities and waivers that such independent auditors shall request) and (ii) any supporting schedules, supporting analyses and other supporting documentation relating to the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement.  If, at the end of such 30-day period, the differences as specified in the Notice of Disagreement are not resolved, Tribune Parties and Cablevision Parties shall (and each shall have the right to require the other to) within 10 Business Days following the end of such 30-day period, engage Ernst & Young LLP (or, if Ernst & Young LLP is unable or unwilling to accept such engagement, Deloitte & Touche LLP or, if Deloitte & Touche LLP is unable or unwilling to accept such engagement, a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually and reasonably acceptable to Tribune Parties and Cablevision Parties) (the "") and submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and which are properly included in the Notice of Disagreement.  In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm shall:  (i) be bound by the provisions of this Section 1.5 and the definitions of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and the definitions included in such definitions; (ii) limit its review to matters still in dispute as specifically set forth in the Notice of Disagreement (and only to the extent such matters are still in dispute following such 30-day period); (iii) further limit its review solely to whether the Statement has been prepared in accordance with this Section 1.5; and (iv) select as the Final Special Distribution Amount the calculation of the party whose calculation of the Final Special Distribution Amount is closest to the determination of the Final Special Distribution Amount of the Accounting Firm (based upon the calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt as initially submitted by Cablevision Parties in the Statement and by Tribune Parties in the Notice of Disagreement).  The determination of any item that is a component of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt and is the subject of a dispute cannot, however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for any particular item in the Statement or the Notice of Disagreement (or, if different, the value claimed by the relevant party at the end of such 30-day period).  Tribune Parties and Cablevision Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within 30 days following the submission of such matters to the Accounting Firm.  Tribune Parties and Cablevision Parties agree that the decisions of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties in the absence of manifest error and that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
(c)
                                 
Accounting Firm
party against which such determination is to be enforced.  Except as specified in the following sentence, the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in connection with the Accounting Firm's determination of Closing Working Capital or Closing Debt pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be borne, in its entirety, by the party (either Tribune Parties or Cablevision Parties) whose calculation of the Final Special Distribution Amount (based upon its calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt as initially submitted by Cablevision Parties in the Statement and by Tribune Parties in the Notice of Disagreement) is furthest away from the Final Special Distribution Amount based upon the Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt as determined by the Accounting Firm.  The fees and expenses of the independent auditors (if any) of Cablevision Parties incurred in connection with the issuance of the Statement and review of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Cablevision Parties, and the fees and expenses of the independent auditors of Tribune Parties incurred in connection with their review of the Statement and their preparation of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Tribune Parties.
 
If the Final Special Distribution Amount is less than the Special Distribution Amount, then Tribune Parties shall, within five Business Days after the final determination of Closing Working Capital and Closing Debt, make payment to Newco by some combination, at the election of Tribune Parties, of (i) the contribution to Newco Sub of uncollected Excluded Accounts Receivable with an aggregate face amount of such deficiency, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day year, from the Closing Date to the date of actual contribution, compounded annually (it is understood and agreed that the value of any uncollected Excluded Accounts Receivable contributed by Tribune Parties pursuant to this clause (i) of Section 1.5(e) shall be considered to have a value equal to their face amount) and/or (ii) wire transfer of immediately available funds in the amount of such deficiency, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360-day year, from the Closing Date to the date of actual payment, compounded annually.
(e)
                                 
 
. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign any of the Newsday Contracts or Business Permits or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Newco Sub thereunder and such consent is not obtained prior to Closing.  Tribune Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of any such third party for the assignment to Newco Sub of any such Newsday Contract or Business Permit.  If such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of the assignor or assignee thereunder so that Newsday would not in fact receive all such rights, Tribune Parties shall, and shall cause each of the other Tribune Entities to, use reasonable best efforts so as to cooperate with Newco Sub in order to provide Newco Sub with the benefits thereunder from and after the Closing Date.  Tribune Parties shall, and shall cause each of the other Tribune Entities to, pay promptly to Newco Sub when received all monies received by any Tribune Entity after the Closing Date under any of the Newsday Contracts or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder to the extent that Newco Sub would be entitled thereto pursuant hereto.  The provisions of this Section 1.6 shall in no way limit the obligation of Tribune Parties to seek consents prior to the Closing.  If and when any such consents shall be obtained, Tribune Parties shall, and shall cause each other Tribune Entity
Section 1.6
                                     
Consent of Third Parties
to, promptly assign its rights thereunder to Newco Sub without payment of consideration and Newco Sub shall, without payment of any consideration therefor, assume from and after the date of such assignment the obligations of Tribune Entities thereunder  (other than the obligations thereunder arising as a result of the breach thereof at or prior to (or in connection with) such assignment).  (It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, so long as Tribune Parties use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Newco Sub as contemplated by this Section 1.6, Tribune Entities will not have any liability or obligation to Newco Sub or any Cablevision Party if Newco Sub is not able to obtain the benefits referred to above.)

Indemnity for Breach of Obligations Set Forth in Section 2
 
(a)
 
(i)
           
In the event that the Company breaches its obligation set forth in Section 2 hereof to any Protected Member or an Indirect Owner thereof (a Trigger Event"), Indemnitors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay to such Protected Member and Indirect Owner as damages an amount (the "Base Amount") equal to the aggregate Federal, state and local income taxes incurred by such Protected Member or Indirect Owner thereof as a result of the income and gain recognized by or allocated under Section 704(c) of the Code (to the
 
extent based upon the difference between fair market value and adjusted basis of the Newsday Assets on the Closing Date, and without regard to income or gain in excess of such built-in gain) to such Protected Member or Indirect Owner thereof by reason of such Trigger Event plus an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Amount") so that, after the payment by such Protected Member or Indirect Owner thereof of all taxes on amounts received pursuant to this Section 3(a), such Protected Member or Indirect Owner thereof retains an amount equal to the Base Amount.  In the event that Indemnitors become aware of a breach of Section 2 hereof with respect to the  Protected Member or an Indirect Owner thereof, Indemnitors shall promptly notify such Protected Member in writing of such Trigger Event and of the sales price or other amount realized for income tax purposes in connection therewith, or the amount by which the Minimum Debt Amount exceeded the outstanding principal amount of LLC Debt and shall provide the Protected Member with copies of all operative documents relating to the Trigger Event and such other relevant materials as may be reasonably requested by the Protected Member.
 
(ii)
          
Upon receipt of such notice, the Protected Member shall provide Indemnitors with any information reasonably requested by Indemnitors of the Protected Member (including information regarding Indirect Owners thereof) to enable Indemnitors to verify the computation of the Make-Whole Payment within thirty (30) days of such request.
 
(iii)
         
In addition, the Protected Member  shall prepare a computation of the Make-Whole Payment owing to such Protected Member or Indirect Owner under this Section 3, which computation shall be delivered to Indemnitors within sixty (60) days after the Protected Member receives notice of the breach pursuant to section 3(a)(i) hereof, but in no event earlier than thirty (30) days after the Indemnitors provide the Protected Member with any information previously reasonably requested by the Protected member.  Indemnitors shall make any required Make-Whole Payment owing to the Protected Member or Indirect Owner pursuant to this Section 3 no later than ten (10) days after delivery by the Protected Member of such computation, or if the Indemnitors do not agree with such computation, within ten (10) days after resolution of such disagreement pursuant to section 3(g) hereof.
 
(b)
          
For purposes of determining the amount of the Make-Whole Payment payable by Indemnitors:
 
(i)
           
In the case of a Protected Member or Indirect Owner that is an individual, (a) all income arising from a transaction or event that is treated as ordinary income under the applicable provisions of the Code and all payments under this Section 3 shall be treated as subject to Federal and New York state income tax at an effective tax rate imposed on ordinary income of nonresidents of New York State (and without regard to state-of-residence taxes), determined using the maximum Federal rate of tax on ordinary income and the maximum New York state rates of tax on ordinary income then in effect, adjusted to reflect the deductibility of state taxes for federal income tax purposes, (b) all other income arising from the transaction or event shall be subject to Federal and New York state income tax at the effective tax rate imposed on long-term capital gains of nonresidents of  New York State (and without regard to state-of-residence taxes), determined using the maximum Federal and New York State rates on long-term capital gains then in effect (including for this purpose with respect to any Code Section 1245 or 1250 recapture, the maximum rate imposed on such income), adjusted to reflect the deductibility of state taxes for federal income tax purposes, and (c) any amounts
 
giving rise to a payment pursuant to section 3(a) hereof will be determined assuming that the Trigger Event was the only transaction or event reported on the Protected Member's or Indirect Owner's tax return (i.e., without giving effect to any loss carry forwards or other deductions attributable to such Protected Member or Indirect Owner).
 
(ii)
          
In the case of a Protected Member that is a partnership or disregarded entity for Federal income tax purposes, section 3(b)(i) hereof shall be applied treating each Indirect Owner of such partnership or disregarded entity as if it were directly a Protected Member, and in the case Protected Member or Indirect Owner that is a C corporation (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(2) of the Code), section 3(b)(i) hereof shall be applied using the highest marginal rate of tax applicable to corporations for Federal income tax purposes and New York State corporate income or franchise tax purposes, adjusted to reflect the deductibility of state taxes for federal income tax purposes.
 
(c)
          
If a Trigger Event occurs in a taxable year for which Tribune is an S corporation (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(1) of the Code):
 
(i)
           
The Base Amount payable to Tribune shall equal (a) the amount of "built-in gains tax" under Section 1374 of the Code and payable by Tribune as a result of such Trigger Event assuming the application of the highest Federal tax rates applicable to such gain and that Tribune's "net recognized built-in gain" for such year equals the amount of "recognized built-in gain" triggered by such event plus, (b) any state tax payable as a result of such Trigger Event determined by applying a 6.5% state tax rate applicable to the amount of built-in gain as determined under Section 3(c)(i)(a) hereof and making the same assumption regarding the amount of "net recognized built-in gain."
 
(ii)
          
No Gross-Up Amount shall be payable to the extent that the receipt of the Base Amount by Tribune does not give rise to "recognized built-in gain" under Section 1374 of the Code.
 
(iii)
         
The amount of any Make-Whole Payment payable to any shareholder or other Indirect Owner of Tribune shall be zero.
 
(iv)
         
For purposes of this section 3(c), Tribune shall be deemed to include any of its qualified subchapter S subsidiaries as defined in Section 1361(b)(3) of the Code.
 
(d)
          
In the case of a Protected Member or Indirect Owner that is not an S corporation, the amount of the Make-Whole Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the present value (calculated using a discount rate of  ten percent (10%) per annum, compounded annually) as of the last day of the taxable year in which the additional tax liability is incurred of an amount equal to the Make-Whole Payment (determined without regard to this Section 3(d)) payable on the tenth anniversary of the date of this Agreement.
 
(e)
          
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Trigger Event occurs in a taxable year in which Tribune is not the sole Protected Member or is not an S corporation wholly-owned by one or more tax-exempt entities, the aggregate Make-Whole Payments made to
 
all Protected Members and Indirect Owners shall not exceed the Make-Whole Payment that would have been due to Tribune if it were at all times the sole Protected Member and an S corporation wholly-owned by one or more tax-exempt entities.
 
(f)
           
The sole and exclusive rights and remedies of  a Protected Member (or Indirect Owner thereof) for a breach or violation of the covenants set forth in Section 2 shall be a claim for money indemnification against Indemnitors in the form of the Make-Whole Payment, computed as set forth in Section 3, and no Protected Member (or Indirect Owner) shall be entitled to pursue a claim for specific performance of the covenant set forth in Section 2 or bring a claim against any person that acquires a Protected Property from the Company in violation of Section 2.  No Protected Member or Indirect Owner shall have any right to indemnification by Indemnitors for taxes other than as provided in this Agreement.
 
(g)
          
If the Company has breached or violated the covenant set forth in Section 2 (or a Protected Member (or Indirect Owner thereof) asserts that the Company has breached or violated the covenant set forth in Section 2), Indemnitors  and the Protected Member agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding any such breach or violation and the amount of damages, if any, payable to such Protected Member or Indirect Owner under this Section 3, including the amount of built-in gain under Sections 1374 and 704(c) of the Code to report on the tax returns to be filed by the parties hereto as a result of the Trigger Event.  If any such disagreement as to tax and Make-Whole Payment calculations cannot be resolved by the Company and such Protected Member within thirty (30) days after the delivery by the Protected Member of the computation referred to in section 3(a)(iii) hereof, Indemnitors and the Protected Member shall jointly retain a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") to act as an arbitrator to resolve as expeditiously as possible all points of any such disagreement (including, without limitation, whether a breach of the covenant set forth in Section 2 hereof has occurred and, if so, the amount of Make-Whole Payment to which the Protected Member (or Indirect Owner thereof) is entitled as a result thereof, determined as set forth in this Section 3).  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm with respect to the resolution of any breach or violation of the covenant set forth in Section 2  hereof and the amount of damages payable to the Protected Member (or Indirect Owner thereof) under this Section 3 shall be final, conclusive and binding on Indemnitors and the Protected Member. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in connection with any such determination shall be borne by the Company.  In the event that Indemnitors and the Protected Member, each having acted in good faith and with its best efforts to select an Accounting Firm, are unable to retain an Accounting Firm within sixty (60) days after the thirty (30) day period mentioned above, then following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, any disagreement may be settled in any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to Section 7 hereof.

Each other Member may elect to participate in such Capital Contributions (pro-rata in accordance with its Percentage Share) by giving written notice to the Company at least 5 days prior to the date specified for the making of the Capital Contribution.  In the event of a Capital Contribution of assets by the Cablevision Member, any matching Capital Contribution made by the other Members shall be in the form of cash.
