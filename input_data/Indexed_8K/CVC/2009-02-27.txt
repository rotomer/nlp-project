FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION
REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2008 RESULTS
 
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2008.
Bethpage, N.Y., February 26, 2009
 
Fourth quarter consolidated net revenues grew 11.4% to $2.052 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and the addition of Newsday and Sundance in the 2008 results.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) was essentially flat (down 0.9% to $604.7 million) compared to the prior year period, and consolidated operating income (which includes impairment charges of $402.4 million at Newsday and $41.0 million at VOOM HD) decreased to an operating loss of $136.5 million.
 
For full year 2008, consolidated net revenues increased 11.5% to $7.230 billion, reflecting revenue growth in Cable Television, Rainbow and Madison Square Garden as well as the addition of Newsday and Sundance in the 2008 results.  Consolidated AOCF grew 10.1% to $2.298 billion and consolidated operating income decreased 24.3% to $689.7 million for full year 2008.  (Full year 2008 operating income was unfavorably impacted by the impairment charges noted above.)
 
Operating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 include:
 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 7.4% and 9.1% and AOCF growth of 4.1% and 10.7% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively
                 
Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") additions of 100,500 and 653,400 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $134.85 in the fourth quarter of 2008
                 
Full year Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1)  of $507.5 million
                 
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision delivered strong results for 2008.  Despite the economic downturn, the company reported full year, double-digit increases in revenue and AOCF.  Our ongoing success in attracting new customers ensured our industry-leading penetration rates throughout the year.  Also noteworthy in 2008, was that Cablevision generated more than $500 million in free cash flow, compared with $158 million in 2007.  The proceeds from our recent successful debt financings, our cash flow and the capacity we have under existing credit facilities have positioned us well from a near-term liquidity perspective," concluded Mr. Dolan.

The increase in net revenues, AOCF and operating income were due principally to the continued expansion of the more efficient, higher margin Ethernet business and includes the impact of the acquisition of 4Connections in October 2008.
 
Rainbow
 
Rainbow consists of the Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  News 12 Networks, VOOM HD (domestic programming discontinued in January 2009), Sundance (effective June 16, 2008), Lifeskool (sold in October 2008), sportskool (sold in September 2008), IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 13.9% to $263.9 million, AOCF rose 15.2% to $66.3 million, and operating income decreased $43.9 million to an operating loss of $9.2 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
Full year 2008 net revenues rose 16.2% to $980.1 million, AOCF grew 30.2% to $251.8 million and operating income decreased 9.9% to $78.1 million, all compared to 2007.
AMC/WE tv/IFC
 
Fourth quarter 2008 net revenues grew 6.7% to $191.3 million, AOCF increased 7.3% to $85.6 million and operating income grew 7.8% to $69.8 million, each compared to the prior year period.
 
The fourth quarter 2008 AOCF results reflect:
 
Viewing subscriber increases of 9.6% at IFC, 6.6% at WE tv and 2.0% at AMC, all compared to December 2007
                 
A 9.0% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
A 2.8% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by growth at WE tv
                 
A 6.2% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming costs.
                 
 
Other Programming
 
Fourth quarter 2008 net revenues rose 36.2% to $78.6 million, AOCF deficit improved 13.0% to a deficit of $19.3 million and operating loss increased $48.9 million to a loss of $79.0 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue and improvement in AOCF was driven primarily by the addition of Sundance in the 2008 quarterly results.  Fourth quarter operating loss is primarily attributable to charges for impairment of programming rights of $41.0 million and employee severance and other costs of $5.8 million as a result of the Company's decision in December 2008 to cease funding the U.S. programming business of VOOM HD.
 
Madison Square Garden
 
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include:  regional and national programming networks (MSG, MSG Plus, and Fuse), professional sports franchises (the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, and the New York Liberty), and MSG Entertainment.  Its operations also include the MSG Arena, the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Beacon Theatre and The Chicago Theatre.
 
Madison Square Garden's fourth quarter 2008 net revenues decreased 2.1% to $405.8 million, AOCF decreased 64.9% to $27.7 million and operating income decreased 85.8% to $8.8 million, all compared to fourth quarter 2007.
 
MSG's fourth quarter results were impacted by:
 
The networks, including a $12.2 million increase in affiliate fee revenue which more than offset $4.2 million of higher direct operating costs
                 
The entertainment business, as revenues from its winter-themed productions declined $19.7 million (primarily due to the downturn in the economy) while related costs increased $9.6 million due mostly to the launch of an arena-sized touring production of the Christmas Spectacular in fourth quarter 2008.  In addition, revenue and costs related to concerts and other entertainment events decreased $8.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively
                 
The teams, including a $7.5 million increase in revenues, primarily due to ticket sales, offset by an $11.5 million increase in net provisions for certain team personnel transactions and an $8.1 million increase in other team operating expenses, primarily team personnel compensation
                 
Higher marketing costs of $4.7 million and net higher legal fees, provisions for litigation and other professional fees of $5.0 million.
                 
 
Madison Square Garden's full year 2008 net revenues increased 4.1% to $1.043 billion, AOCF decreased 54.6% to $61.8 million and operating income decreased $79.1 million to a loss of $17.2 million, all as compared to the prior year.
Newsday
 
The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com, Island Publications (through December 2008) and Star Community Publishing, the northeast's largest group of weekly shopper publications.
 
Newsday's fourth quarter 2008 net revenues were $107.1 million, AOCF was $10.3 million and operating loss was $407.6 million.  Operating loss was impacted by $402.4 million in impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter 2008.  These impairment charges reflect the continuing deterioration of values in the newspaper industry and the greater than anticipated economic downturn and its current and anticipated impact on Newsday's advertising business. The impairment charges are not expected to result in any material future cash expenditures.
 
For the period from the date of acquisition (July 29, 2008) through December 31, 2008, Newsday's net revenues were $180.6 million, AOCF was $18.8 million and operating loss was $403.3 million.
 
Other Matters
 
.
On February 25, 2009, the Board of Directors of Cablevision declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on each outstanding share of both its Cablevision NY Group Class A Stock and its Cablevision NY Group Class B Stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 31, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2009
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
