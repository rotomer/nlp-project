REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2009 RESULTS
 
Bethpage, N.Y., May 7, 2009
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
 
First quarter consolidated net revenues grew 10.6% to $1.903 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and the addition of Newsday and Sundance in the 2009 results.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) increased 14.3% to $590.0 million and consolidated operating income grew 21.3% to $297.8 million, both compared to the prior year period.
 
Operating highlights for the first quarter 2009 include:
                 
Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1)  of $170.3 million for the quarter
                 
Cable Television net revenue growth of 4.8% and AOCF growth of 6.9% for the quarter
                 
Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") additions of 84,200 for the quarter and 540,600 since March 2008
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $136.55 in the first quarter of 2009
                 
Optimum Lightpath net revenue growth of 8.0% and AOCF growth of 15.6% as compared to the first quarter 2008
                 
Madison Square Garden AOCF growth of $18.4 million as compared to the first quarter 2008
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision performed well in the first quarter in what continues to be a challenging economic environment.  The company reported solid increases in revenue and AOCF and more than doubled free cash flow to $170 million for the quarter.  Our core cable business continues to experience steady growth in our digital video, voice and high-speed Internet services.  These results extended Cablevision's industry-leading penetration rates for yet another quarter while MSG and Rainbow generated strong operating cash flow growth of their own," concluded Mr. Dolan.

Optimum Lightpath
For first quarter 2009, Lightpath net revenues rose 8.0% to $64.2 million, AOCF increased 15.6% to $21.0 million and operating income improved $3.1 million to $1.7 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenues, AOCF and operating income were due principally to the continued expansion of the more efficient, higher margin Ethernet business and includes the impact of the acquisition of 4Connections in October 2008.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of the Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  Sundance (effective June 16, 2008), News 12 Networks, VOOM HD (domestic programming discontinued in January 2009), IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the first quarter of 2009 increased 10.7% to $249.3 million, AOCF rose 41.3% to $71.7 million, and operating income grew 40.2% to $38.8 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
AMC/WE tv/IFC
First quarter 2009 net revenues grew 8.7% to $194.1 million, AOCF increased 14.4% to $84.9 million and operating income grew 17.7% to $68.1 million, each compared to the prior year period.
 
The first quarter 2009 AOCF results reflect:
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 9.0% at IFC, 8.4% at WE tv and 2.2% at AMC, all compared to March 2008
                 
A 9.4% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
A 7.6% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher units sold at AMC
                 
A 4.6% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming costs offset in part by lower marketing costs.
 
Other Programming
First quarter 2009 net revenues rose 15.5% to $61.1 million, AOCF deficit improved 43.6% to a deficit of $13.3 million and operating loss improved 3.0% to a loss of $29.3 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by the addition of Sundance (acquired June 2008) partially offset by the impact of the discontinuation of the domestic programming business at VOOM HD in the 2009 results.  The increase in AOCF was primarily due to the addition of Sundance and cost savings related to VOOM.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include:  regional and national programming networks (MSG, MSG Plus, and Fuse), professional sports franchises (the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, and the New York Liberty), and MSG Entertainment.

MSG's first quarter results were impacted by:
                 
The networks, including an $8.5 million increase in revenues, primarily due to higher affiliate fees, and a $4.0 million decrease in operating costs
                 
The entertainment business, including a $6.7 million decrease in revenues due to fewer Arena events offset by a $5.7 million decrease in event-related variable costs
                 
The teams, including a $4.4 million increase in revenues, due in part to ticket sales, and a $4.4 million decrease in expenses primarily related to legal and professional fees.

The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com; and Star Community Publishing, the northeast's largest group of weekly shopper publications.

.
 
Separately, the Board of Directors of Cablevision has authorized the company's management to explore the spin-off of its Madison Square Garden business.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
