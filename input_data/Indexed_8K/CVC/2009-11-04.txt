SURPASSED 2 MILLION OPTIMUM VOICE CUSTOMERS IN THIRD QUARTER
 
Bethpage, N.Y., November 3, 2009
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009.
 
Third quarter consolidated net revenues grew 5.3% to $1.840 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) increased 14.7% to $667.7 million and consolidated operating income grew 32.2% to $381.6 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Third quarter 2009 AOCF and operating income include favorable adjustments of $25.7 million relating to the resolution of regulatory and legal matters at Cable.  Excluding the impact of these items, the growth in AOCF and operating income would have been 10.3% and 23.3%, respectively.
 
Operating highlights for the third quarter 2009 include:
                 
Year-to-date Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1) of $623.0 million

Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter.  In addition to an increase in revenue, the company reported an impressive gain in AOCF fueled by continuing growth across all of our key businesses  cable, Rainbow and MSG.  Also noteworthy in the third quarter, Cablevision generated $220 million in free cash flow, our cable business surpassed two million voice customers and Rainbow National Services' generated a significant increase in advertising revenue of more than 18 percent.  We are pleased with our momentum in what remains a challenging environment and continue to focus on building our businesses for the long-term. Separately, we are moving forward with the spin-off of our Madison Square Garden business and believe we are on track to complete the transaction by year-end," Mr. Dolan concluded.

The improved results were due principally to the continued expansion of the more efficient, higher margin Ethernet business and include the impact of the acquisition of 4Connections in October 2008.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of the Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  Sundance (effective June 16, 2008), News 12 Networks, VOOM HD (domestic programming discontinued in January 2009), IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the third quarter of 2009 increased 3.5% to $260.1 million, AOCF rose 37.8% to $86.0 million, and operating income grew 82.7% to $53.5 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
AMC/WE tv/IFC

The third quarter 2009 AOCF results reflect:
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 4.7% at WE tv, 3.3% at IFC and 1.2% at AMC, all compared to September 2008
                 
A 7.3% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
 
                 
An 18.2% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher units sold at AMC and higher ratings at WE tv
                 
A 6.9% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming costs at WE tv and AMC principally related to original programming partially offset by lower marketing costs at AMC and IFC.
 
Other Programming
Third quarter 2009 net revenues decreased 17.2% to $60.2 million, AOCF improved 49.3% to a deficit of $9.8 million and operating loss improved 26.4% to a loss of $25.8 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The revenue decline was primarily the result of the discontinuation of the domestic programming business at VOOM HD and the sale of our VOD services (Lifeskool and sportskool) in the 2009 results.  The improvement to the AOCF deficit and operating loss was primarily due to cost savings related to VOOM HD as well as improved results at Sundance.
 
Madison Square Garden
Madison Square Garden's primary businesses include: MSG Media (MSG, MSG Plus, Fuse, and MSG Interactive), MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports (including the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, the New York Liberty and a wide variety of other premiere live sporting events).

MSG's third quarter results were impacted by:
                 
MSG Media, including a $10.7 million increase in revenues due to higher network affiliation fees as well as a $6.3 million decrease in operating costs
                 
MSG Entertainment, including a $9.8 million decrease in revenues offset by a $5.9 million decrease in event-related variable costs primarily due to fewer entertainment events in the Madison Square Garden Arena.
                 
Lower legal and other professional fees of $8.9 million.
 
Newsday
The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com; and Star Community Publishing, the northeast's largest group of weekly shopper publications.

On November 2, 2009, the Board of Directors of Cablevision
declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on each outstanding share of both its Cablevision NY Group Class A Stock and its Cablevision NY Group Class B Stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on December 4, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2009
.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
