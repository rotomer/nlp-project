On April 13, 2010, CSC Holdings, LLC ("CSC Holdings"), and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Restricted Subsidiaries") entered into an Amendment Agreement (the "Amendment Agreement") with the financial institutions parties thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, providing for (i) an amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 24, 2006, as first amended and restated in its entirety as of May 27, 2009 and further amended and restated in its entirety as of April 13, 2010 (as amended and restated, the "Credit Agreement"), among CSC Holdings, the Restricted Subsidiaries parties thereto, the lenders parties thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and L/C Issuer, and (ii) an amendment to the Incremental Term Supplement, dated as of March 29, 2006 and amended as of May 27, 2009 (as amended, the "Incremental Term Supplement"), among CSC Holdings, the Lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement.
Among other things, the Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, provides for the specific mechanics of extending, from time to time, the Revolving Credit Commitments, Term A Loans, Incremental Term Loans and any Additional Facility Commitments or Additional Facility Loans, as applicable, with the terms of such Extended Facility to be documented at the time of such extension in an Extended Facility Agreement. Each Extended Facility Agreement will set forth specific terms and conditions applicable to such Extended Facility, including, but not limited to, (i) the extended maturity date, (ii) a revised schedule of amortization of principal, if applicable and (iii) a per annum extension fee, in each case as determined by the Borrower and the Extended Facility Lenders under such Extended Facility Agreement. Lenders under an Extended Facility may be assigned the same designation as an existing Extended Facility of the same facility type (i.e., Revolver, Term A or Incremental Term) to the extent the terms and conditions, including maturity date, amortization schedule and pricing, are the same. From time to time, individual Revolving Credit Lenders or Term A Lenders can extend their maturity date by joining an existing Extended Revolving Credit Facility or Term A Facility with the same maturity date and such lender will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the other lenders under such Extended Facility. Optional prepayments that the Borrower elects to apply to the Term Loans may be paid pro-rata across all Term Facilities of every type (i.e., the Term A Facility, the Incremental B Term Facility, the Incremental B-2 Extended Term Facility, an Additional Facility or a previously entered into Extended Term A Facility or Extended Incremental Term Facility) or may be applied only to a Term Facility of one type. Alternatively, optional prepayments to a Term Facility of one type may be applied only to the Non-Extended Term Lenders or, after all such Non-Extended Term Lenders have been repaid, to Extended Term Lenders, but no Extended Term Lenders may be prepaid prior to Extended Term Lenders under the same Facility type (i.e. the Term A Facility or the Incremental Term Facility) with an earlier Maturity Date.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, CSC Holdings entered into three extended Facilities as of April 13, 2010, as follows:
 
 
 
In addition, Revolving Credit Lenders with Revolving Credit Commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately $410 million executed joinders to the Credit Agreement agreeing to provide increased Revolving Credit Commitments with an Availability Period expiring on March 31, 2015.
The above description does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Amendment Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the Extended Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Extended Term A Facility Agreement or
the Extended Incremental Term Facility Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to those agreements, a copy of each of which is attached as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Any information disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K or the exhibits hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material.
 
On April 15, 2010, Cablevision issued $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due April 15, 2018 (the "2018 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal of senior notes due April 15, 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and collectively, the "Notes") in a registered public offering pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated April 12, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between Cablevision and J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., as representative of the underwriters named in Schedule I thereto. The Notes were registered by Cablevision under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-165887) (the "Registration Statement"). A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Cablevision intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to address the company's upcoming debt maturities, including the tender offer Cablevision commenced on April 12, 2010 for all of its 8% Senior Notes due 2012 and for general corporate purposes.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 2, 2010, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 15, 2010 (together, the "Indenture"), between Cablevision and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee.
The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum and mature on April 15, 2018. The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum and mature on April 15, 2020. Interest will be payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning October 15, 2010. The Notes are Cablevision's senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of Cablevision's other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at Cablevision's option at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Indenture) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture), plus 50 basis points plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the redemption date. A copy of the Form of Notes and the First Supplemental Indenture is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

(e) If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, (i) any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for you or counsel for the Company to amend or supplement the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) in order that the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) to comply with law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters thereof and prepare and file with the Commission and furnish to the Underwriters such amendment or supplement such that the statements in the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or so that the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) will comply with law. Except as otherwise required by the preceding sentence, the Company will not be obligated to update the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information. Such updating may be done by means of the filing of one or more documents under the 1934 Act that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or Time of Sale Information.
(f) The Company will make generally available to its security holders and the Representative as soon as practicable an earning statement that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(g) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with you, to qualify the Securities for distribution under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as you may designate, if any, and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of the Prospectus; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.

In connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2018 and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Securities") pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of April 2, 2010, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 15, 2010 (together, the "Indenture"), between Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), we, as your counsel, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion, the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
As contemplated by the qualifications set forth above, in rendering the foregoing opinion, we are expressing no opinion as to Federal or state laws relating to fraudulent transfers.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction nor with respect to any Federal or state laws relating to communications and telecommunications, including laws which regulate individuals, companies or businesses because such entities provide communications or telecommunications services, including the provision of cable television services or telephone services.
 
We have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimens thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Securities has been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company for purposes of incorporating this opinion into the registration statement relating to the Securities and to the references to us under the heading "Validity of the Notes" in the prospectus supplement relating to the Securities. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Company shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Illegality
Section 3.03 . If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
Inability to Determine Rates
Section 3.04 . (a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans
Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate contemplated by ) or the L/C Issuer;
Section 3.04(e)
 
(ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or
Section 3.01
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Credit Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Credit Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
 
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
(e) . The Company shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans
Section 3.05 . Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
Compensation for Losses
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Company (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company; or
 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to ;
Section 10.12
including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Base Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.05
Section 3.06 . (a) . If any Lender requests compensation under , or the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to or , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

Article III
 
Section 4.01 . Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Company to the Secured Parties, arising hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Secured Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof). The Administrative Agent's books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Obligations, absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.
Guaranty
Section 4.02 . Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Secured Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.
Rights of Lenders
Section 4.03 . Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability, change in corporate existence or structure or other defense of the Company or any other Guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Secured Party) of the liability of the Company or any other Guarantor; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Company or any other Guarantor; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor's liability
Certain Waivers
 
hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Company, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.
Section 4.04 . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other Guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against such Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Company or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
Obligations Independent
Section 4.05 . Each Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Secured Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
Subrogation
Section 4.06 . This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments and the Facilities with respect to the Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor is made, or any of the Secured Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Secured Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Secured Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
Termination; Reinstatement
Section 4.07 . Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Company owing to such Guarantor, whether
Subordination
 
now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Company to such Guarantor as subrogee of the Secured Parties or resulting from such Guarantor's performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations. If the Secured Parties so request, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Company to any Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Secured Parties and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Secured Parties on account of the Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty.
Section 4.08 . If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Guarantor or the Company under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by such Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Secured Parties.
Stay of Acceleration
Section 4.09 . Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Company and any other Guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Company and any such other Guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Secured Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Secured Parties at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Company or any other Guarantor (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
Condition of Company
Section 4.10 . It is the intention of the Guarantors, the Lenders and the Company that the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be in, but not in excess of, the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. To that end, but only to the extent such obligations would otherwise be avoidable, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, would not render such Guarantor insolvent or unable to make payments in respect of any of its indebtedness as such indebtedness matures or leave such Guarantor with an unreasonably small capital. The need for any such limitation shall be determined, and any such needed limitation shall be effective, at the time or times that such Guarantor is deemed, under applicable law, to incur the Obligations hereunder. Any such limitation shall be apportioned amongst the Obligations pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts thereof. This paragraph is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Lenders under this Credit Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and neither the Guarantors, the Company nor any other Person shall have any right under this paragraph that it would not otherwise have under applicable law. The Company and each Guarantor agree not to commence any proceeding or action seeking to limit the amount of the obligation of such Guarantor under this by reason of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "insolvency", "unreasonably small capital" and "unable to make payments in respect of any of its indebtedness as such indebtedness matures" shall be determined in accordance with applicable law.
