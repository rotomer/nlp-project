FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2010 RESULTS
 
Bethpage, N.Y., May 6, 2010
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
First quarter consolidated net revenues grew 5.2% to $1.752 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow, offset by a decline at Newsday.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") (1) grew 7.6% to $610.4 million and consolidated operating income grew 21.6% to $355.1 million, both compared to the prior year period.
 
Operating highlights for the first quarter 2010 include:
 
                 
Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1) of $240.5 million
                 
Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") additions of 97,900 for the first quarter
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $146.15 in the first quarter of 2010
                 
Cable advertising revenue growth of 35.1% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the prior year period.
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision had a strong start to 2010.  Subscriber increases across all of our consumer services, including basic video, fueled our growth in cable, and continued our industry-leading penetration rates for yet another quarter.  Meanwhile, Rainbow National Services achieved strong revenue growth and double-digit AOCF growth, driven largely by significant increases in both advertising and affiliate revenue.  For the first quarter, Cablevision also generated $240 million in free cash flow.  Given our strong performance, we have increased our dividend by 25 percent, enabling us to provide even more value to our shareholders," concluded Mr. Dolan.
 
Results from Continuing Operations (2)
 
Segment results for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

(2)
         
Operating results of Madison Square Garden and Rainbow DBS' distribution operations are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented as applicable.
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
 
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded commercial data and voice services.
 
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the first quarter 2010 rose 5.9% to $1.406 billion, AOCF grew 8.4% to $564.8 million and operating income increased 20.6% to $354.7 million, all compared to the prior year period.

The first quarter 2010 increases in net revenues, AOCF and operating income were principally driven by the growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers as well as higher rates.
 
The first quarter 2010 results reflect:
 
                 
Basic video
customers up 900 from December 2009 and down 37,900 or 1.2% from March 2009
                 
iO: Interactive Optimum
customers up 12,000 or 0.4% from December 2009 and 58,500 or 2.1% from March 2009
digital video

of $146.15, up $2.12 or 1.5% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and up $9.60 or 7.0% from the first quarter of 2009.
Television RPS
 
Optimum Lightpath
 
For first quarter 2010, Lightpath net revenues increased 6.1% to $68.1 million, AOCF increased 22.9% to $25.9 million and operating income increased $3.3 million to $5.0 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The improved results were driven primarily by an increase in revenue from Ethernet services offset in part by a slight increase in operating expenses to support the increase in Ethernet installations.
 
Rainbow
 
Rainbow consists of Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  Sundance Channel, News 12 Networks, VOOM HD (domestic programming discontinued in January 2009), IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 6.3% to $265.1 million, AOCF rose 7.3% to $76.7 million, and operating income grew 12.6% to $43.6 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
AMC/WE tv/IFC
 
First quarter 2010 net revenues grew 9.5% to $212.6 million, AOCF grew 17.2% to $99.5 million and operating income grew 21.3% to $82.6 million, each compared to the prior year period.
 
The first quarter 2010 AOCF results reflect:
 
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 2.2% at WE tv, 2.0% at IFC and 1.8% at AMC, all compared to March 2009
                 
An 8.1% increase in affiliate revenue compared to the prior year period
                 
An 11.6% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher units sold at AMC and WE tv
                 
A 3.6% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming costs at AMC and WE tv offset in part by a decrease in marketing.
Other Programming
 
First quarter 2010 net revenues decreased 6.7% to $57.0 million, AOCF declined $9.4 million to a deficit of $22.8 million and operating loss increased by $9.6 million to a loss of $39.0 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  The revenue decline was primarily the result of the discontinuation of the VOOM HD domestic programming business in January 2009.  AOCF deficit and operating loss were impacted by higher legal fees as well as increased costs at Sundance in 2010.
 
Newsday
 
The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com; and Star Community Publishing, a group of weekly shopper publications.
 
Newsday's first quarter 2010 net revenues decreased 10.4% to $74.7 million, AOCF improved $1.1 million to $1.2 million and operating loss improved $2.5 million to a loss of $4.7 million, all compared to the prior year period.  The revenue decline was primarily due to a 12.7% decrease in advertising revenue.   The improved AOCF was a result of expense reductions in newsprint and compensation which more than offset the decline in revenue.
 
Other Matters
 
In addition, on May 5, 2010, the Board of Directors of Cablevision
declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on each outstanding share of both its Cablevision NY Group Class A Stock and its Cablevision NY Group Class B Stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on June 7, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2010
.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
