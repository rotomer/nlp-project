FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Bethpage, N.Y., August 5, 2010
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 
Second quarter consolidated net revenues grew 5.8% to $1.802 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow, offset slightly by a decline at Newsday.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")(1) grew 9.0% to $677.6 million and consolidated operating income grew 23.0% to $416.8 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Second quarter 2010 AOCF and operating income were favorably impacted by a $23 million programming cost adjustment related to prior years.  If excluded, AOCF and operating income would have grown 5.3% and 16.2%, respectively, compared to the prior year period.
 
Operating highlights for the second quarter 2010 include:
 
                 
Year-to-date Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1) of $431.7 million
                 
Revenue Generating Units ("RGU") additions of 75,900 for the second quarter, including an increase in basic video customers
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $149.12 in the second quarter of 2010
                 
Cable advertising revenue growth of 26.7% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to the prior year period.
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "For the second quarter, Cablevision delivered solid increases in revenue and AOCF, driven primarily by the ongoing strength of our core businesses.  Both Cable and Rainbow performed well over the last three months fueled, in part, by impressive double-digit increases in advertising revenue.  In addition, our cable business continues to experience steady growth across all of our consumer services, including basic video, which helped maintain Cablevision's industry-leading penetration rates again this quarter.  We are pleased with our 2010 year-to-date results, highlighted by free cash flow of $432 million," concluded Mr. Dolan.
 
Results from Continuing Operations(2)
 
Segment results for the quarters ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

See definition of adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF") and Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations included in the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures on page 4 of this earnings release.
 
(2)
                    
Operating results of Madison Square Garden and Rainbow DBS' distribution operations are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented as applicable.
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
 
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevision's "Optimum" branded video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure  and its "Optimum Lightpath" branded commercial data and voice services.
 
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the second quarter 2010 rose 6.0% to $1.437 billion, AOCF grew 12.2% to $620.6 million and operating income increased 24.4% to $407.2 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Second quarter 2010 AOCF and operating income include a $23 million reduction in expenses resulting from a programming cost adjustment related to prior years.  Excluding this item, the growth in AOCF and operating income would have been 8.0% and 17.3%, respectively.
 
Cable Television
 
Cable Television second quarter 2010 net revenues increased 5.6% to $1.372 billion, AOCF rose 12.2% to $592.6 million and operating income increased 24.0% to $401.1 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The second quarter 2010 increases in net revenues, AOCF and operating income were principally driven by the growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers as well as higher rates.  (Second quarter 2010 AOCF and operating income include the programming cost adjustment discussed above.  Excluding this item, the growth in AOCF and operating income would have been 7.8% and 16.9%, respectively.)
 
The second quarter 2010 results reflect:
 
                 
Basic video
customers up 2,900 from March 2010 and down 26,200 or 0.8% from June 2009

digital video

For second quarter 2010, Lightpath net revenues increased 18.1% to $70.8 million, AOCF increased 11.8% to $27.9 million and operating income increased 54.0% to $6.1 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  Second quarter 2009 results were impacted by adjustments to intra-segment revenues and interconnection charges both of which were reduced by a favorable resolution of disputed third party charges.  If excluded, revenue growth would have been 7.6%, AOCF growth would have been 19.1% and operating income growth would have been 153.1%.  The improved results were driven primarily by a 33.5% increase in revenue from Ethernet services offset in part by a slight increase in operating expenses to support the increase in Ethernet installations.
 
Rainbow
 
Rainbow consists of Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  Sundance Channel, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the second quarter of 2010 increased 11.2% to $280.5 million, AOCF rose 3.8% to $91.6 million, and operating income grew 18.4% to $57.8 million, all compared to the prior year period.
 
AMC/WE tv/IFC
 
Second quarter 2010 net revenues grew 11.9% to $222.7 million, AOCF grew 8.2% to $103.5 million and operating income grew 11.5% to $86.4 million, each compared to the prior year period.
The second quarter 2010 AOCF results reflect:
 
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 2.2% at AMC, 2.7% at IFC and 2.3% at WE tv, all compared to June 2009
                 
An 18.1% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher pricing at AMC and WE tv
                 
A 15.2% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming and marketing costs at AMC.
 
Other Programming
 
Second quarter 2010 net revenues increased 8.9% to $63.4 million, AOCF declined $4.5 million to a deficit of $12.0 million and operating loss improved 0.2% to a loss of $28.5 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  Revenue growth was primarily due to increases at Sundance Channel and News 12 Networks while the AOCF deficit and operating loss reflect higher operating costs, primarily at IFC Entertainment.
 
Newsday
 
The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com; and Star Community Publishing, a group of weekly shopper publications.
 
Newsday's second quarter 2010 net revenues decreased 9.7% to $80.1 million, AOCF improved 3.7% to $5.2 million and operating loss improved $1.4 million to a loss of $1.3 million, all compared to the prior year period.  The revenue decline was primarily due to a 12.6% decrease in advertising revenue.   The improved AOCF was a result of expense reductions in newsprint and compensation which more than offset the decline in revenue.
 
Other Matters
 
On August 4, 2010, the Board of Directors of Cablevision declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on each outstanding share of both its Cablevision NY Group Class A Stock and its Cablevision NY Group Class B Stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on September 7, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2010.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
