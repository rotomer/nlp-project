FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Bethpage, N.Y., November 4, 2010
- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010.
 
Third quarter consolidated net revenues grew 5.6% to $1.808 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow, offset slightly by a decline at Newsday.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF")(1) grew 3.6% to $661.7 million and consolidated operating income grew 8.3% to $401.2 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Third quarter 2009 AOCF and operating income include favorable adjustments of $25.7 million relating to the resolution of regulatory and legal matters at Cable.  If excluded, consolidated AOCF and operating income would have grown 8.0% and 16.4%, respectively, compared to the prior year period.
 
Operating highlights for the third quarter 2010 include:
                 
Year-to-date Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations(1) of $656.4 million
                 
Average Monthly Revenue per Basic Video Customer ("RPS") of $149.04 in the third quarter of 2010
                 
Cable advertising revenue growth of 30.2% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the prior year period.
 
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "Cablevision continued to perform well in the third quarter as the ongoing strength of our core businesses led to solid increases in both revenue and AOCF.  The company's cable operations generated a significant increase in advertising revenue of 30 percent, while continuing to enjoy industry-leading penetration rates.   Meanwhile, Rainbow achieved double-digit revenue growth for the third quarter thanks to impressive gains in both advertising and affiliate revenue.   Also noteworthy this quarter, Cablevision generated an additional $225 million in free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date number to $656 million," concluded Mr. Dolan.
 
Results from Continuing Operations(2)
Segment results for the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

Operating results of Madison Square Garden are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented as applicable.
Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath

Third quarter 2009 AOCF and operating income include favorable adjustments of $25.7 million relating to the resolution of regulatory and legal matters at Cable.  Excluding these items, the growth in AOCF and operating income would have been 7.8% and 15.1%, respectively.
 
Cable Television
Cable Television third quarter 2010 net revenues increased 4.8% to $1.366 billion, AOCF rose 2.3% to $563.3 million and operating income increased 6.3% to $372.4 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The third quarter 2010 increases in net revenues, AOCF and operating income were principally driven by the twelve month growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers as well as higher rates.  (Third quarter 2009 AOCF and operating income include the items discussed above.  Excluding these items, the growth in AOCF and operating income would have been 7.3% and 14.8%, respectively.)

The improved results were driven primarily by a 33.1% increase in revenue from Ethernet services offset in part by higher operating expenses to support the increase in Ethernet installations.
 
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of Rainbow National Services ("RNS")  AMC, WE tv and IFC  as well as Other Programming which includes:  Sundance Channel, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures.
 
Rainbow net revenues for the third quarter of 2010 increased 12.0% to $291.4 million, AOCF rose 12.2% to $96.4 million, and operating income grew 18.1% to $63.0 million, all compared to the prior year period.

The third quarter 2010 AOCF results reflect:
                 
Viewing subscriber increases of 2.8% at AMC, 2.5% at IFC and 2.8% at WE tv, all compared to September 2009
                 
A 12.9% increase in advertising revenue, as compared to the prior year period, driven principally by higher pricing at AMC and WE tv
                 
A 16.6% increase in operating costs compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased programming and marketing costs at AMC.
 
Other Programming
Third quarter 2010 net revenues increased 13.5% to $68.3 million, AOCF deficit improved 68.4% to a deficit of $3.1 million and operating loss improved 25.5% to a loss of $19.3 million, all as compared to the prior year period.  Revenue growth was primarily due to increases at Sundance Channel, IFC Entertainment and News 12 Networks.  Improved operating results were primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in revenue as well as lower litigation costs relating to VOOM.
 
Newsday
The Newsday segment consists of Newsday, a daily newspaper that primarily serves Long Island; amNewYork, a free daily serving New York City; various Internet properties including Newsday.com; and Star Community Publishing, a group of weekly shopper publications.
 
Newsday's third quarter 2010 net revenues decreased 4.3% to $76.5 million, AOCF decreased 28.3% to $4.0 million and operating loss increased $0.9 million to a loss of $1.7 million, all compared to the prior year period.  The revenue decline was primarily driven by a 7.6% decrease in advertising revenue.  The decrease in AOCF was due to the revenue decline partially offset by lower compensation costs.
 
Other Matters
On November 3, 2010, the Board of Directors of Cablevision declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on each outstanding share of both its Cablevision NY Group Class A Stock and its Cablevision NY Group Class B Stock.  This quarterly dividend is payable on December 6, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2010.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We define adjusted operating cash flow ("AOCF"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
 
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
 
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, ("Free Cash Flow"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
