On December 16, 2010, Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") announced that its board of directors has authorized the company's management to move forward with the leveraged spin-off of Rainbow Media Holdings LLC to Cablevision's stockholders. The spin-off would be structured as a tax-free pro rata distribution to stockholders and is expected to be completed by mid-year 2011, subject to necessary approvals.
As part of the leveraged spin-off, a refinancing of what will be the new Rainbow would create new debt, a portion of which would be used to repay approximately $1.25 billion of Cablevision and/or CSC Holdings, LLC debt. It is anticipated that the spin-off would be in the form of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders of Cablevision, with holders of Class A common stock receiving Class A shares in Rainbow and holders of Class B common stock receiving Class B shares in Rainbow. Both Cablevision and Rainbow would continue to be controlled by the Dolan family through their ownership of Class B shares.
The new Rainbow's assets will include:
Businesses that will remain a part of Cablevision include the cable and telecommunications businesses, , News 12 Networks, MSG Varsity and Clearview Cinemas.
Newsday
Completion of the spin-off is subject to a number of external conditions, including receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the finalization of the terms and conditions of the required financing, as well as final approval by Cablevision's board of directors. In late November, the company submitted a private letter ruling request to the IRS regarding the leveraged spin-off.
A copy of the press release containing the announcement is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NEWS FROM
 Following the exploration of a possible spin-off of its Rainbow Media Holdings LLC business, Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE: CVC) today announced that its board of directors has authorized the company's management to move forward with the leveraged spin-off of Rainbow Media to Cablevision's stockholders. The spin-off would be structured as a tax-free pro rata distribution to stockholders and is expected to be completed by mid-year 2011, subject to necessary approvals.
Bethpage, N.Y., December 16, 2010
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented: "We are moving forward with the spin-off of Rainbow from Cablevision, which will create two distinct companies  one led predominantly by a premiere cable business and another that houses an attractive portfolio of successful programming assets. We believe this will provide both Cablevision and Rainbow with greater flexibility to freely pursue their own strategic objectives and individual business plans, while allowing investors to more clearly evaluate each of the separate companies' assets and future potential."
As part of the leveraged spin-off, a refinancing of what will be the new Rainbow would create new debt, a portion of which would be used to repay approximately $1.25 billion of Cablevision and/or CSC Holdings, LLC debt. It is anticipated that the spin-off would be in the form of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders of Cablevision, with holders of Class A common stock receiving Class A shares in Rainbow and holders of Class B common stock receiving Class B shares in Rainbow.
