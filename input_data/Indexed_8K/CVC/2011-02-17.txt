- Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010.
Bethpage, N.Y., February 16, 2011
Fourth quarter consolidated net revenues grew 5.7% to $1.869 billion compared to the prior year period, reflecting solid revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow.  Consolidated adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF)grew 2.3% to $631.7 million and consolidated operating income grew 1.6% to $355.9 million, both compared to the prior year period.  Fourth quarter 2010 results reflect the newly acquired Bresnan properties from the date of acquisition on December 14, 2010 including a $14.4 million contract termination charge.  Revenue, AOCF and operating income growth compared to the prior year period would have been 4.5%, 3.4% and 5.6%, respectively, if Bresnan results were excluded.

For full year 2010, consolidated net revenues increased 5.6% to $7.231 billion, reflecting revenue growth in Telecommunications Services and Rainbow.  Consolidated AOCF grew 5.6% to $2.581 billion and consolidated operating income grew 13.1% to $1.529 billion for full year 2010.  Excluding the impact of Bresnan discussed above, net revenue, consolidated AOCF and operating income would have grown 5.3%, 5.9% and 14.2%, respectively, compared to the prior full year period.
Operating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 include:
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  Cablevisions growth continued in the fourth quarter and contributed to solid full-year increases in revenue and AOCF.  In 2010, Cablevision generated more than $855 million in free cash flow, a 13 percent increase compared to 2009.  In addition to our solid operations, we took a number of steps last year to create value for our shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend by 25 percent, initiating a stock repurchase program, completing the historic spin-off of Madison Square Garden and, of course, the Bresnan acquisition.  Separately, for 2011, we are moving forward with the spin-off of our Rainbow business and believe we are on track to complete that transaction by mid-year, concluded Mr. Dolan.

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevisions video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure -- and its Optimum Lightpath branded commercial data and voice services.   Operating results of the recently acquired Bresnan properties from the date of acquisition on December 14, 2010 are included in the Telecommunications and Cable Television results discussed below.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the fourth quarter 2010 rose 5.3% to $1.459 billion, AOCF grew 0.4% to $580.9 million and operating income decreased 1.2% to $360.3 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Revenue, AOCF and operating income growth compared to the prior year period would have been 3.7%, 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively, if Bresnan results were excluded.
Full year 2010 net revenues rose 5.6% to $5.736 billion, AOCF increased 5.8% to $2.358 billion, and operating income increased 11.9% to $1.500 billion, all as compared to the prior year period.  Revenue, AOCF and operating income growth compared to the prior year period would have been 5.2%, 6.2% and 13.0%, respectively, if Bresnan results were excluded.
Cable Television
Cable Television fourth quarter 2010 net revenues increased 4.9% to $1.390 billion, AOCF decreased 0.4% to $551.5 million and operating income decreased 1.9% to $352.5 million, each compared to the prior year period.  The fourth quarter 2010 increase in net revenues were driven by the twelve month growth in digital video, high-speed data, and voice customers as well as higher rates.  Fourth quarter 2010 AOCF and operating income were driven by the revenue increase offset by increased expenses, including a $14.4 million contract termination charge at Bresnan.  Excluding the Bresnan results, growth in revenue, AOCF and operating income would have been 3.3%, 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively.
The following table illustrates the change in customer base during the fourth quarter including the impact of the Bresnan properties:
Optimum Lightpath
For fourth quarter 2010, Lightpath net revenues increased 8.8% to $72.2 million, AOCF increased 17.6% to $29.3 million and operating income increased 51.9% to $7.8 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The improved results were driven primarily by a 30.8% increase in revenue from Ethernet services offset in part by higher operating expenses to support the increase in Ethernet installations.
Rainbow
Rainbow consists of the National Networks:  AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel as well as other Rainbow ventures including its International Services, IFC Entertainment and Rainbow Network Communications.  News 12 Networks and Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation (RASCO) which were previously included in the Rainbow segment have been reclassified to our Other reportable segment for all periods presented.

The revenue decline was primarily driven by decreases at Newsday and Clearview Cinemas offset in part by an increase in net advertising revenue at News 12 Networks.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares and stock options, the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate managements effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, (Free Cash Flow), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparableto similar measures reported by other companies.
