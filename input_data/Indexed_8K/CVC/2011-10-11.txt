Explanatory Note
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 26, 2011 (the "Original Filing") by Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") solely for the purpose of disclosing the Company's decision as to how frequently it will hold stockholder advisory votes on the compensation of executive officers (the "Say on Pay Vote"). Except as set forth below, this Current Report on Form 8-K/A does not modify or update any other disclosure contained in the Original Filing.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
As previously reported in the Original Filing, at the Company's 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, more than a majority of the holders of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock and the holders of Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock, voting together as a single class, approved the advisory vote for a three-year frequency for the Say on Pay Vote as was recommended by the Company's Board of Directors.
In light of such stockholder vote, the Company has determined that it will hold a Say on Pay Vote every three years at its annual stockholder meetings until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of the Say on Pay Vote.
