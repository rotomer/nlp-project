grew 21.0% to $626.2 million and consolidated operating income grew 28.3% to $346.2 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Footnote 2 on page 4 of this release details certain items affecting the comparability of our results for 2011 and 2010.  Excluding these items, consolidated net revenues, AOCF and operating income would have increased 1.0%, 0.8% and 3.6%, respectively, all compared to the prior year period.
For full year 2011, consolidated net revenues increased 8.5% to $6.701 billion, consolidated AOCF grew 8.1% to $2.295 billion and consolidated operating income grew 3.6% to $1.229 billion, all compared to 2010.  Footnote 2 on page 4 of this release details certain items affecting the comparability of our results for 2011 and 2010.  Excluding these items, net revenue would have grown 1.2%, consolidated AOCF would have been essentially flat and operating income would have increased 2.1%, compared to the prior full year period.
Operating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 include:
Cablevision President and CEO James L. Dolan commented:  "2011 was an important year for Cablevision as it marked the culmination of several multi-year initiatives to enhance shareholder value.  Those efforts have included spinning off MSG and AMC, completing the Bresnan acquisition, paying quarterly cash dividends, and actively conducting a share buyback program.  For the fourth quarter, despite modest video subscriber losses, our cable operations continued to report improved subscriber metrics in both high-speed data and voice customers.  The company also generated healthy free cash flow.   We remain confident in the strength of our underlying business and in our ability to deliver industry-leading products.   Looking ahead, we will continue to improve on those offerings while we remain focused on enhancing shareholder returns and building the company for the long term," concluded Mr. Dolan.

Telecommunications Services  Cable Television and Lightpath
Telecommunications Services includes Cable Television  Cablevisions video, high-speed data, and voice residential and commercial services offered over its cable infrastructure -- and its Optimum Lightpath branded commercial data and voice services.
Telecommunications Services net revenues for the fourth quarter 2011 rose 8.3% to $1.580 billion, AOCF increased 17.2% to $672.1 million and operating income increased 21.0% to $427.2 million, all compared to the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of the items highlighted in the chart on page 4 of this release, revenue growth would have increased 1.5%, AOCF would have decreased 1.1% and operating income would have increased 2.3%, compared to the prior year period.
Full year 2011 net revenues rose 9.5% to $6.280 billion, AOCF increased 7.0% to $2.496 billion, and operating income increased 3.2% to $1.521 billion, all as compared to the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of the items highlighted in the chart on page 4 of this release, revenue would have grown 1.7% while AOCF would have been essentially flat and operating income would have increased 2.0%, compared to the prior year period.
Cable Television
Cable Television fourth quarter 2011 net revenues increased 8.3% to $1.506 billion, AOCF increased 16.8% to $635.7 million and operating income increased 19.0% to $411.0 million, all compared to the prior year period.  The increase in revenue compared to the prior year period was due primarily to the addition of Bresnan in the results for the fourth quarter 2011.  Excluding the impact of the  items highlighted on page 4, revenue would have increased 1.2%, AOCF would have decreased 1.8% and operating income would have increased 1.1%, all compared to the prior year period.  Fourth quarter 2011 AOCF results reflect the revenue growth, combined with higher expenses, primarily programming costs, compared to the prior year period.
The following table illustrates the change in the Cable Television customer base during the fourth quarter of 2011:
Optimum Lightpath
For fourth quarter 2011, Lightpath net revenues increased 9.6% to $79.1 million, AOCF increased 24.3% to $36.5 million and operating income increased 106.3% to $16.1 million, each as compared to the prior year period.  The improved results were driven primarily by a 12.7% increase in revenue from Ethernet services, offset in part by higher operating expenses to support the increase in Ethernet installations.  Excluding certain items referenced in the chart on page 4, AOCF and operating income would have grown 12.1% and 54.6%, respectively.

Other
Other primarily consists of Newsday, News 12 Networks, MSG Varsity, Clearview Cinemas, Cablevision Media Sales Corporation (formerly Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation (RASCO)) and unallocated corporate general and administrative costs.
Fourth quarter 2011 net revenues decreased 5.5% to $116.9 million, AOCF deficit improved by 18.3% to a deficit of $45.9 million and operating loss improved 2.7% to a loss of $80.9 million all compared to the prior year period.  Revenue was mainly impacted by the continued decline of advertising revenues at Newsday.  Excluding the impact of certain items highlighted in the chart on page 4, revenue would have decreased 5.4% while the AOCF deficit and operating loss would have improved 19.3% and 2.3%, respectively.  Improvement in AOCF deficit was due primarily to lower corporate costs offset by Newsday.
Full year 2011 net revenues decreased 4.7% to $443.9 million, AOCF deficit improved 3.3% to a deficit of $201.4 million and operating loss increased 1.5% to a loss of $292.0 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share-based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits.  Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items.  We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares, restricted stock units and stock options, the expense associated with an award that is not expected to be made in cash.
We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure.  We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis.  AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry.  Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate managements effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators.  AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.  For a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss), please see page 6 of this release.
We define Consolidated Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations, (Free Cash Flow), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less capital expenditures (continuing operations), both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Net cash from operating activities excludes net cash from operating activities of our discontinued operations.  We believe the most comparable GAAP financial measure of our liquidity is net cash from operating activities.  We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of our overall liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses.  It is also one of several indicators of our ability to make investments and/or return capital to our shareholders. We also believe that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow our industry for comparison of our liquidity with other companies in our industry, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparableto similar measures reported by other companies.
 
In addition, in the chart on page 4, the Company has provided details of certain items affecting the comparability of Revenue, net, AOCF and operating income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 to that of the comparable periods in 2010.  Management believes that this additional information, like AOCF representing non-GAAP financial measures, will assist analysts, investors and others in evaluating the Companys performance.
