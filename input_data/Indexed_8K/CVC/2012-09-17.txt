The Securities are to be sold to each Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, in the respective principal amounts as are set forth in Schedule I opposite the name of the Underwriter. The Securities are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated April 2, 2010, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of April 15, 2010 and as further supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2) (as so supplemented and amended, the "Indenture"). The Securities and the Indenture are more fully described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus referred to below.

(c) Before making, preparing, using, authorizing, approving or filing any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and before filing any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (other than a report or statement required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act), the Company will furnish to counsel for the Underwriters a copy of the proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, amendment or supplement for review and will not make, prepare, use, authorize, approve or file any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representative reasonably objects.
(d) The Company will advise the Representative promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective; (ii) when any supplement to the Prospectus or any amendment to the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus has been filed (other than a report or statement required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act); (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the receipt of any comments from the Commission relating to the Registration Statement or any other request by the Commission for any additional information; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or the initiation or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act; (v) of the occurrence of any event within the Prospectus Delivery Period as a result of which the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading; and (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the 1933 Act; and (vii) of the receipt by the Company of any notice with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, preventing or suspending the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or suspending any such qualification of the Securities and, if any such order is issued, will obtain as soon as practicable the withdrawal thereof.
(e) If at any time during the Prospectus Delivery Period, (i) any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for you or counsel for the Company to amend or supplement the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale
 
Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) in order that the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) to comply with law, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters thereof and prepare and file with the Commission and furnish to the Underwriters such amendment or supplement such that the statements in the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or so that the Prospectus (or the Time of Sale Information to the extent the Prospectus is not yet available) will comply with law. Except as otherwise required by the preceding sentence, the Company will not be obligated to update the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information. Such updating may be done by means of the filing of one or more documents under the 1934 Act that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or Time of Sale Information.
(f) The Company will make generally available to its security holders and the Representative as soon as practicable an earning statement that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 of the Commission promulgated thereunder covering a period of at least twelve months beginning with the first fiscal quarter of the Company occurring after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.
(g) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with you, to qualify the Securities for distribution under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as you may designate, if any, and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of the Prospectus; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified as above provided.

It is expected that that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about September 27, 2012, which will be the 10th business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as "T+10"). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to September 27, 2012 will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+10, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.
The issuer has filed a registration statement, including a prospectus and a preliminary prospectus supplement, with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and the preliminary prospectus supplement in that registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus and the preliminary prospectus supplement (or, if available, the prospectus supplement) if you request it by calling Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated at 1-800-294-1322 (toll free).

been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
(3) All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Covered Laws for the issuance, sale and delivery of the Securities by the Company to you have been obtained or made.
(4) The execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance of the Securities in accordance with the Indenture and the sale of the Securities by the Company to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement will not, violate the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
(5) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
We are expressing no opinion in paragraphs (2) and (4) above, insofar as performance by the Company of its obligations under the Securities, the Indenture or the Underwriting Agreement is concerned, as to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights. Also, for purposes of the opinions in paragraph (3) above, "Covered Laws" means the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York (including the
published rules or regulations thereunder) that in our experience normally are applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by the Securities, the Indenture or the Underwriting Agreement; , , that such term does not include Federal or state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws, Federal or state communications or telecommunications laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, the Securities, the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets.
provided
however
The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction nor with respect to any Federal or state laws relating to communications and telecommunications, including laws which regulate individuals, companies or businesses because such entities provide communications or telecommunications services, including the provision of cable television services or telephone services.
In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimens thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Securities") of Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company").
The Registration Statement relating to the Securities (File No. 333-165887) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated April 2, 2010 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated September 13, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, letters addressed to you from the Company's accountants and opinions addressed to you from the Company's deputy general counsel and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., special federal communications law counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Also, we confirm to you that the statements
contained under the caption "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, insofar as they relate to provisions of the documents therein described and insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects.
Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:43 P.M. on September 13, 2012, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph has caused us to believe that the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement except to the extent specifically noted in the fourth sentence of the second preceding paragraph. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report as to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the description of Federal and state communications statutes, regulations, proceedings or as to other matters referred to in the opinion of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. addressed to you and dated the date hereof or as to the statement of the eligibility of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued.
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representative of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the several Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
                      Incorporated
As Representative of the Several Underwriters,
One Bryant Park,
New York, New York 10036.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Secretary of Cablevision Systems Corporation (the "Company") and, in such capacity, have acted as counsel for the Company and its subsidiaries, and am familiar with the Underwriting Agreement dated as of September 13, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") by and among the Company and the several Underwriters referred to therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"). Except as otherwise specified herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement and used herein are used as defined therein.
In that connection, I have examined executed counterparts of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. I have also examined the originals or certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents, records, agreements and certificates of the Company and its subsidiaries and have made such examinations of law as I have deemed necessary to enable me to render the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact relating to the Company and its subsidiaries material to the opinions hereinafter set forth, I have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, as well as certificates of public officials.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with corporate power and authority under such laws to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus.
2. The Company is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property of a nature, or transacts business of a type, that would make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.
3. Each Material Subsidiary that is a corporation or a limited liability company is duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, with corporate or other power and authority under such laws to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business. Each Material Subsidiary that is a partnership is duly organized under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
4. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests, as the case may be, of each Material Subsidiary that is a corporation or limited liability company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; except as set forth on Schedules III and IV to the Underwriting Agreement or as disclosed in or as contemplated by the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, all of such shares and membership interests and all the outstanding partnership interests of each Material Subsidiary that is a partnership are owned by the Company, directly or through one or more subsidiaries, free and clear of any material pledge, lien, security interest, charge, claim, equity or encumbrance of any kind; no holder thereof is subject to personal liability under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the respective Material Subsidiary or the corporation law of the jurisdiction in which such Material Subsidiary is organized by reason of being such a holder and none of such shares was issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any stockholder of such Material Subsidiary under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of such Material Subsidiary or the corporation law of the jurisdiction in which such Material Subsidiary is organized.
5. To my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party, or of which any of their properties are or may be the subject, of a character which are required to be disclosed in the 2011 Form 10-K of the Company or any subsequent Exchange Act report, other than those disclosed in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
6. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein and any untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained therein which was corrected in the Prospectus, as to which I express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and I have no reason to believe that such documents, read together, as of the date of the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus or as of the date hereof contained or contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
7. I do not know of any contracts or documents of a character required to be described or referred to in the documents incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the documents incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus that are not described, referred to or filed as required.
8. To my knowledge, no default exists in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that is described or referred to in the Company's 2011 Form 10-K or any subsequent Exchange Act report or filed as an exhibit thereto, which default would have a material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.
9. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture by the Company and the issuance and delivery of the Securities, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and compliance by the Company with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture will not conflict with the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument (including any franchise agreement, license, permit or other governmental authorization granted by the New York State Public Service Commission or any Federal or New York State governing body having jurisdiction over cable television operations) known to me to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject, which conflict, breach, violation or default would have a material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any Federal, New York or Delaware General Corporation Law, statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any Federal, New York or Delaware court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their properties, which violation in each case would have a material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, except with respect to such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state or foreign securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters.
I am a member of the bar of the State of New York and do not herein intend to express any opinions as to any matters governed by any laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States of America (other than any Federal communications laws as to which I express no opinion).
 
(i) No approvals are required to be obtained from the FCC to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
(ii) The information in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus incorporated by reference from the Company's 2011 Form 10-K under the captions "BusinessCompetitionCable Television," "BusinessCompetitionHigh-Speed Data," "BusinessCompetitionVoIP," "BusinessCompetitionOptimum Lightpath and the Bresnan CLECs" and "BusinessRegulation," to the extent that such sections describe statutes, regulations and governmental proceedings or matters involving federal communications and copyright law and policy and the impact thereof on the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged, has been reviewed by them and fairly represents the federal communications and copyright law applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and material and relevant to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.
In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the District of Columbia and the Federal law of the United States, upon opinions of other counsel, who shall be counsel satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters, in which case the opinion shall state that they believe you and they are entitled to so rely. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.
