First Quarter Highlights:
  As of March 31, 2003, excluding network rental members, Coventry had a total of 2.13 million members, an increase of 326,000 members, or 18.0%, over the prior year and an increase of 96,000 members, or 4.7%, over the prior quarter due to organic growth of 50,000 members and the acquisition of PersonalCare for 77,000 members, partially offset by the previously announced termination of the Mid-America Health Partners Medicare Risk contract for 21,000 members and other commercial losses in the Mid-America acquisition.
Membership.
 Coventry achieved commercial rate increases of 13.0% on first quarter renewals, representing approximately 55% of commercial risk membership. The Company expects commercial rate increases, net of benefit buydowns, to be in the range of 13% to 15% for the remainder of 2003.
Commercial Rate Increases.
  MLR was 82.6% for the quarter, a 190 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Commercial MLR of 81.0% was a 310 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and is the main driver of overall MLR improvement. Commercial inpatient days per 1000 members of 230 were flat to the prior year quarter.
Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).
  SG&A expenses were 12.2% of operating revenues for the quarter, flat to the prior quarter.
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
 Cash and investments grew to $1.19 billion during the quarter, up $67.1 million from year-end. Premium Accounts Receivable of $85.8 million represent 7.2 days of sales. Total Days in Medical Claim Payables (DCP) were 56.2. Excluding the impact of the Mid-America and PersonalCare acquisitions, DCP was 55.9, a decrease of 2.1 days from the prior quarter. The decrease in DCP is due to faster claims receipts, payments, and reduced claim inventory levels.
Balance Sheet.
  Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $59.5 million as reported, and $92.6 million when adjusted for the timing of $33.1 million of CMS payments for Medicare+Choice beneficiaries received in December 2002, as compared to net income of $49.5 million.
Cash Flow.
 The Company did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter. The Company will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares under its existing program, with outstanding authority of 2.5 million shares.
Share Repurchase.
