Commercial Rate Increases
. MLR was 80.9% for the quarter, a 230 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Commercial MLR of 80.0% was a 270 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and is the main driver of overall MLR improvement.

Cash flow for the six months ending June 30, 2003 was $144.2 million as reported, and $177.3 million when adjusted for the timing of CMS payments for Medicare+Choice beneficiaries as compared to year-to-date net income of $112.9 million.
