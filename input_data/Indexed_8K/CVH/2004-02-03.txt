For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 total revenues were $4.54 billion, a 27% increase over 2002, with net earnings of $2.75 per diluted share, a 74% increase over 2002.

"These outstanding results, balanced across all our markets, speak as much to the future as they do to the past. Our success in 2003 was built upon a competitive cost structure which served as the springboard for record new sales resulting in organic growth of 7.7% for the year. In addition to our strong organic growth, we successfully added another 244,000 members through our PersonalCare and Altius acquisitions. Our strategy to offer the most expansive and responsive products to our markets coupled with our continued improvement in customer service, patient care, network management, and overhead control, will continue to deliver demonstrated value to our customers and provide Coventry with continued opportunity for profitable growth."

Commercial Rate Increases
. MLR was 80.9% for the quarter, a 210 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Commercial MLR of 78.8% was a 370 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and is the main driver of overall MLR improvement.
Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)
. SG&A expenses were 11.9% of operating revenues for the quarter, flat to the prior quarter and a 30 basis point reduction over the prior year.
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
. Cash and investments grew to $1.41 billion during the quarter, up $286.8 million from yearend. Net Premium Accounts Receivable of $89.8 million represent 6.8 days of sales outstanding (DSO) with the Commercial only DSO running at 5.8 days. Days in Claims Payable (DCP) were 51.01, a decrease of 4.8 days. DCP, on a same store basis adjusting for timing differences related to the Altius acquisition in September of 2003, decreased 3.0 days. The decrease in DCP is due to faster claim receipts and processing cycle times as well as efforts to reduce claim inventories in advance of January open enrollment activities.

. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $85.1 million as reported, and $46.6 million when adjusted for the timing of CMS payments for Medicare+Choice beneficiaries, as compared to net income of $69.7 million.
