First Quarter Highlights:
As of March 31, 2004, excluding network rental members, Coventry had a total of 2.43 million members, an increase of 300,000 members, or 14%, over the prior year quarter and an increase of 48,000 members, or 2.0%, over the prior quarter.
Membership.
Coventry achieved commercial rate increases in excess of 12.5% on first quarter renewals, representing approximately 55% of commercial risk membership. The Company expects 2004 commercial rate increases, net of benefit buydowns, to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.5%.
Commercial Rate Increases.
MLR was 81.3% for the quarter, a 130 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Commercial MLR of 79.4% was a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and is the main driver of overall MLR improvement.
Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).
SG&A expenses were 11.6% of operating revenues for the quarter, a 30 basis point reduction over the prior quarter and a 60 basis point reduction over the prior year quarter.
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
Cash and investments grew to $1.45 billion during the quarter, up $45.3 million from prior year-end. Days in Claims Payable (DCP) were 52.4, an increase of 1.4 days. The increase in DCP is due to a normalized claims inventory partially offset by faster claim receipts and processing cycle times and timing of pharmacy invoice payments.
Balance Sheet.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $127.1 million as reported, and $165.7 million when adjusted for the timing of CMS payments for Medicare+Choice beneficiaries, as compared to net income of $74.3 million.
