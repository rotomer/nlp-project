8.1      The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including without limitation members of advisory boards of health care organizations and other facilities owned by the Corporation and physicians serving on medical staff committees of such health care organizations) of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or not taken by such person while acting in any such capacity, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Third Party Proceedings.
8.2      The Corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including without limitation members of advisory boards of hospitals and other facilities owned by the Corporation and physicians serving on medical staff committees of such hospitals) of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or not taken by him while acting in any such capacity, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. The termination of any such threatened or actual action or suit by a settlement or by an adverse judgment or order shall not of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation. Nevertheless, there shall be no indemnification with respect to expenses incurred in connection with any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Actions By or In the Right of the Corporation.
8.3      To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or a person serving in any other enterprises at the request of the Corporation, shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defending against any threatened or actual action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 8.1 hereof or any threatened or actual action or suit referred to in Section 8.2 hereof, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
Absolute Right.
8.4      Any indemnification under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof (unless ordered by a court), shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific cases upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the person claiming indemnification has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such Sections. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the shareholders.
Determination of Conduct.

Insurance.
8.7      The indemnification provided hereunder shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any other bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or engaged in any other enterprise at the request of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Indemnity Not Exclusive.
