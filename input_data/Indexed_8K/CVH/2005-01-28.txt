Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On January 28, 2005, Coventry Health Care, Inc. (the "Company") closed the private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 7/8% senior notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes") and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 6 1/8% senior notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes" and, together with the 2012 Notes, collectively, the "Notes"), which was previously announced on January 14, 2005. The Notes were issued pursuant to two separate indentures, each dated as of January 28, 2005 (collectively, the "Indentures"), between the Company and Wachovia Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The description of the material terms of the Indentures governing the Notes included in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this item.
     In addition to the Indentures, the Company entered into two separate registration rights agreements for the Notes, each dated as of January 28, 2005 (collectively, the "Registration Rights Agreements"), by and among the Company and Lehman Brothers Inc., CIBC World Markets Corp., ABN AMRO Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Wachovia Securities, BNP Paribas, BNY Capital Markets, Inc. and Piper Jaffray & Co. (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). Under the Registration Rights Agreements, the Company has agreed to file within 120 days and use its best efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), having substantially identical terms as the Notes (except that additional interest provisions and transfer restrictions pertaining to the Notes will be deleted). If the Company fails to cause the registration statement relating to the exchange offer to become effective within the time period specified in the Registration Rights Agreements, the Company will be required to pay additional interest on the Notes until the registration statement is declared effective.
     In addition, the Company entered into a $450 million Credit Agreement dated as of January 28, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement") with the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto (the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A., Lasalle Bank National Association and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as documentation agents (in such capacity, the "Documentation Agents"), Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as syndication agent (in such capacity, the "Syndication Agent"), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"). The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year term loan of $300 million and a five-year revolving credit facility of $150 million. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The description of the material terms of the Credit Agreement included in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this item.
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On January 28, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of First Health Group Corp. ("First Health"), a Delaware corporation. First Health merged with and into Coventry Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 13, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Merger Sub and First Health (the "Merger"). First Health is a full-service national health benefits service company headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, that

specializes in providing large payors with integrated managed care solutions. First Health is a national managed care company serving the group health, workers' compensation and state agency markets. As of September 30, 2004, First Health had total assets of $1.0 billion, total liabilities of $543.8 million and total equity of $478.3 million. Each outstanding share of First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9.375 cash and 0.1791 shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the Merger, the Company is issuing approximately 16.5 million shares of common stock.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     As discussed above, on January 28, 2005, the Company completed an offering of the Notes. The Notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future senior debt, including its existing 8.125% senior notes due 2012 and its new credit facilities. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.
     The 2012 Notes will mature on January 15, 2012 and the 2015 Notes will mature on January 15, 2015. Interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate of 5 7/8% per annum on the 2012 Notes and 6 1/8% per annum on the 2015 Notes and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on July 15, 2005. The Company will pay interest to those persons who were holders of record on January 1 or July 1 immediately preceding each interest payment date. Interest will accrue on the Notes from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
     The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. The Company is required to offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest, if it experiences specific kinds of changes in control.
     The Indentures under which the Notes have been issued, among other things, restrict the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to: make investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock; create liens; incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. From and after the date on which the Notes receive investment grade ratings from two designated rating agencies, certain covenants related to the Notes will terminate and a covenant relating to sale and leaseback transactions will become effective.
     If an event of default with respect to a series of Notes shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the registered holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes then outstanding may declare to be immediately due and payable the principal amount of
Table of Contents
all the Notes of such series then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration.
     As discussed above, on January 28, 2005, the Company also entered into new senior credit facilities providing for a term loan in the principal amount of $300 million and a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $150 million.
     The term loan facility has a maturity of five years and requires regularly scheduled quarterly payments of principal and interest. Unless terminated earlier, the revolving credit facility will mature five years after closing and is payable in full upon its maturity on the termination date.
     Loans under the new senior credit facilities bear interest at a margin or spread in excess of either (1) the one-, two-, three- or six-month rate for the Eurodollar deposits (the "Eurodollar Rate") or (2) the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the prime rate of the Administrative Agent ("ABR"), as selected by the Company. The margin or spread depends on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and the Company's consolidated leverage ratio and varies from 0.750% to 2.000% for Eurodollar Rate loans and from 0.000% to 1.000% for ABR loans. Commitment fees will accrue and be payable quarterly in arrears at an initial rate of 0.375% per annum, and subsequently at a rate ranging from 0.250% to 0.500% depending on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and the Company's consolidated leverage ratio, multiplied by the daily average undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility.
     The revolving credit facility provides for a $40 million subfacility for letters of credit. Letter of credit fees are payable in respect of outstanding letters of credit at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate loans. A fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the undrawn amount is payable to the issuer of each letter of credit.
     The Credit Agreement contains covenants, including, among other things, covenants that restrict the Company's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; incur guarantee obligations; create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets; pay dividends or other distributions, purchase or redeem the Company's equity securities or those of its subsidiaries and make other restricted payments; make loans, advances or other investments (including acquisitions); engage in certain transactions with affiliates; agree with others to limit their ability to grant liens on assets; agree with others to limit the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to pay dividends or other restricted payments or to make loans or transfer assets to the Company or another of its subsidiaries. The new senior credit facilities also require compliance with specified financial ratios and tests, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum net worth requirement.
     If an event of default under the new senior credit facilities shall occur and be continuing, the commitments under the new senior credit facilities may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the new senior credit facilities, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing under the Credit Agreement and related loan documents, may be declared immediately due and payable.
     The Company used the net proceeds of the offering and sale of the Notes, together with borrowings under the new senior credit facilities, to acquire First Health, repay First Health's

outstanding bank debt, and pay transaction fees and expenses in connection with the First Health acquisition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Section 4.09 only, there shall be excluded from Consolidated Net Income any dividends, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of assets from Unrestricted Subsidiaries to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to the extent such dividends, repayments or transfers increase the amount of Restricted Payments permitted under clause (c)(4) of the first paragraph of Section 4.09.

(h) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes. At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been exchanged for Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note shall be returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for Definitive Notes, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note shall be reduced accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note, such other Global Note shall be increased accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase. (i) General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.

(ii) No service charge shall be made to a Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10 or 4.13 hereof). (iii) All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. (iv) Neither the Registrar nor the Company shall be required to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note between a record date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. (v) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Notes and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 38
(vi) The Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof. (vii) All certifications, certificates and Opinions of Counsel required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06 to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile with the original to follow by first class mail. (viii) Subject to compliance with any applicable additional requirements contained in this Article, when a Note is presented to the Registrar with a request to register a transfer thereof or to exchange such Note for an equal principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided, however, that every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by an assignment form and, if applicable, a transfer certificate, each in the form included in Exhibit B attached hereto and in form satisfactory to the Registrar and each duly executed by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, upon surrender of any Note for registration of transfer or exchange at an office or agency maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate, Notes of a like aggregate principal amount at maturity at the Registrar's request. (ix) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.03 shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Notes upon transfer or exchange of Notes. (x) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Note (including any transfers between or among Participants or other beneficial owners of interests in any Global Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. (xi) None of the Company, the Trustee or any Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of or transfers of, beneficial ownership interests in a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company and the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Company shall issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee's requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond must be 39
supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company may charge for its expenses in replacing a Note. Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Company and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued hereunder. Section 2.08. Outstanding Notes. (a) The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Note. (b) If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Company and the Trustee receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser. (c) If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue. (d) If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on a redemption date or other maturity date, money sufficient to pay all principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest payable on that date with respect to the Notes (or portions thereof) maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Notes (or portions thereof) shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue interest. Section 2.09. Treasury Notes. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company or by any Affiliate of the Company, shall be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Section 2.10. Temporary Notes. Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate Definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes at any office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose and such exchange shall be without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor, one or more Definitive Notes representing an equal principal amount of Notes. 40
Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture. Section 2.11. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee upon direction by the Company and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Notes (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act). Certification of the destruction of all cancelled Notes shall be delivered to the Company. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, provided that no such special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid. Section 2.13. CUSIP or ISIN Numbers. The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers in any notices to the Holders as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers. Section 2.14. Additional Interest. If Additional Interest is payable by the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and paragraph 1 of the Notes, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate to that effect stating (i) the amount of such Additional Interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such a certificate or instruction or direction from the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Additional Interest is payable. The foregoing shall not prejudice the rights of the Holders with respect to their entitlement to Additional Interest as otherwise set forth in this Indenture or the Notes and pursuing any action against the Company directly or otherwise directing the Trustee to take any such action in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Notes. If the Company has paid Additional Interest directly to the persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment. 41

The Company shall make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to any Holder who shall have given written directions to the Company or the Paying Agent to make such payments by wire transfer pursuant to the wire transfer instructions supplied to the Company or the Paying Agent by such Holder on or prior to the applicable record date. Notes may be presented for payment at the office or agency of the Paying Agent and Registrar within the City and State of New York. Payments in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note (including principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC. Section 4.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency. (a) The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an office or drop facility of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where Notes may be presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to 42
maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. (b) The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

All such reports shall be prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission applicable to such reports. If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Company's reporting obligations with respect to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be deemed satisfied in the event the Company files such reports with the Commission on EDGAR and delivers a copy of such reports to the Trustees. If, at any time after consummation of the Exchange Offer contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, the Company shall nevertheless continue filing the reports specified 43
in the preceding paragraphs with the Commission, within the time periods specified above unless the Commission will not accept such a filing.

(c) The Company shall, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any event that with the giving of notice and the lapse of time would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. Section 4.05. Taxes. The Company shall pay, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay, prior to delinquency, all material taxes, assessments, and governmental levies except such as are contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings or where the failure to effect such payment is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. 44

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. Section 4.07. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each of its Significant Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. Section 4.08. Limitation on Debt. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Debt (including any Acquired Debt) unless either: (1) such Debt is Debt of the Company and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.00 to 1.00; provided, that if the Debt which is the subject of a determination under this provision is Acquired Debt or Debt to be incurred in connection with the simultaneous acquisition of any Person, business or Property, then such ratio shall be determined on a pro forma basis, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the four quarter period used in the determination of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, or (2) such Debt is Permitted Debt. The term "Permitted Debt" is defined to include the following: (a) (i) Debt of the Company evidenced by the Notes issued on the Issue Date, the Exchange Notes or any new notes issued in exchange for Additional Notes, provided such new notes have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such Additional Notes and are issued pursuant to an exchange offer similar to the Exchange Offer; and (ii) Debt of the Company evidenced by the 2015 Notes issued on the Issue Date, the "Exchange Notes" (as defined in the 2015 Indenture) or any notes issued in exchange for "Additional Notes" (as defined in the 2015 Indenture), provided such new notes have terms substantially identical in all material 45
respects to such Additional Notes and are issued pursuant to an exchange offer similar to the "Exchange Offer" (as defined in the 2015 Indenture); (b) Debt of the Company under Credit Facilities, provided that the aggregate principal amount of all such Debt under Credit Facilities at any one time outstanding shall not exceed $300.0 million; (c) Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Capital Lease Obligations and Purchase Money Debt, provided that: (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Debt does not exceed the purchase price or cost of the Property acquired, constructed or leased, and (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Incurred and then outstanding pursuant to this clause (c) (together with all Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred and then outstanding in respect of Debt previously Incurred pursuant to this clause (c)) does not exceed $100.0 million; (d) Debt of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary and Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any subsequent issue or transfer of Capital Stock or other event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of any such Debt (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Debt by the issuer thereof; provided further, that if the Company is the obligor on such Debt, such Debt must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes; (e) Debt representing Hedging Obligations entered into by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary for the purpose of fixing, hedging or swapping interest rate risk in the ordinary course of the financial management of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary and not for speculative purposes, provided that the obligations under such agreements are directly related to payment obligations on Debt otherwise permitted by the terms of this Section 4.08; (f) Debt in connection with one or more standby letters of credit or performance bonds issued by, or for the account of, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, workers' compensation claims, appeal bonds and warranty or contractual service obligations, or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit; (g) Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date not otherwise described in clauses (a) through (f) above; (h) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or otherwise became a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of the Company or was otherwise acquired by the Company), provided that at the time such 46
Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or otherwise became a Restricted Subsidiary and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt, the Company would have been able to Incur $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08; (i) Debt arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business, provided, however, that such Debt is extinguished within five business days of incurrence; (j) Debt arising from any agreement of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnities, guarantees, purchase price adjustments, holdbacks, contingency payment obligations based on the performance of the acquired or disposed assets or similar obligations (other than guarantees of Debt) Incurred by any Person in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary; (k) additional Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $100.0 million in the aggregate; (l) Attributable Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with any Sale and Leaseback Transaction in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $75.0 million in the aggregate; (m) additional Debt of the Company in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $250.0 million; and (n) Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08 and clauses (a), (c), (g), (h), (k), (l), (m) and (n) above; provided in the case of Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (h), such Permitted Refinancing Debt may only be incurred by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.08, (a) the Company shall not Incur any Debt pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08 if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Subordinated Obligations unless such Debt shall be subordinated to the Notes to at least the same extent as such Subordinated Obligations, (b) the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to Incur any Debt pursuant to this Section 4.08 if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Debt of the Company, and (c) accrual of interest, accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Debt, will be deemed not to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this Section 4.08. For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.08, (i) in the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses 47
(a) through (m) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) the first paragraph of this Section 4.08, the Company may, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify (in whole or in part) such item of Debt in any manner that complies with this Section 4.08 and such item of Debt will be treated as having been incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph hereof and (ii) for the purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Debt denominated in a foreign currency, the dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Debt incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the earlier of the date that such Debt was incurred, in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided that if such Debt is incurred to refinance other Debt denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.08, the maximum amount of Debt that the Company may incur pursuant to this Section 4.08 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Debt incurred to refinance other Debt, if incurred in a different currency from the Debt being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Debt is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Section 4.09. Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Company shall not make, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such proposed Restricted Payment, (a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (b) the Company could not Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08 or (c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments declared or made since the Start Date (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if made other than in cash, to be based upon the Fair Market Value at the time of such Restricted Payment) other than Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (b) through (g) of the next succeeding paragraph would exceed an amount equal to the sum of: (1) 50% of the aggregate amount of Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from the Start Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending at least 45 days prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or if the aggregate amount of Consolidated Net Income for such period shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit), plus (2) 100% of the Capital Stock Sale Proceeds, plus (3) the sum of: (A) the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance or sale after the Start Date of convertible or exchangeable Debt that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, and 48
(B) the aggregate amount by which Debt (other than Subordinated Obligations) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company's consolidated balance sheet on or after the Start Date upon the conversion or exchange of any Debt issued or sold on or prior to the Start Date that is convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, excluding, in the case of clause (A) or (B): (x) any such Debt issued or sold to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Company or any such Subsidiary for the benefit of their employees, and (y) the aggregate amount of any cash or other Property distributed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon any such conversion or exchange, plus (4) an amount equal to the sum of: (A) the net reduction in Investments in any Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary resulting from dividends, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of Property, in each case to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from such Person, and (B) the portion (proportionate to the Company's equity interest in such Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, provided, however, that the foregoing sum shall not exceed, in the case of any Person, the amount of Investments previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company may: (a) pay dividends on its Capital Stock within 60 days of the declaration thereof if, on said declaration date, such dividends could have been paid in compliance with this Indenture; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (b) purchase, repurchase, redeem, legally defease, acquire or retire for value Capital Stock of the Company or Subordinated Obligations in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Company or any such Subsidiary for the benefit of their employees); provided, however, that (1) such purchase, repurchase, redemption, legal defeasance, acquisition or retirement shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and 49
(2) the Capital Stock Sale Proceeds from such exchange or sale shall be excluded from the calculation pursuant to clause (c) (2) above; (c) purchase, repurchase, redeem, legally defease, acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Obligations in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Permitted Refinancing Debt; provided, however, that such purchase, repurchase, redemption, legal defeasance, acquisition or retirement shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (d) repurchase shares of, or options to purchase shares of, common stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from current or former officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or permitted transferees of such current or former officers, directors or employees), pursuant to the terms of agreements (including employment agreements) or plans (or amendments thereto) approved by the Board of Directors under which such individuals purchase or sell, or are granted the option to purchase or sell, shares of such common stock; provided, however, that: (1) the aggregate amount of such repurchases shall not exceed $5.0 million in any calendar year and (2) at the time of such repurchase, no other Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or result therefrom); provided further, however, that such repurchases shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; and (e) acquire its Capital Stock in connection with the exercise of warrants outstanding on the Start Date, stock options or stock appreciation rights by way of cashless exercise; and (f) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Company or an Restricted Subsidiary issued on or after the date of this Indenture in accordance with Section 4.08; (g) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of Disqualified Stock of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company made by exchange for, or out of the net proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale of Disqualified Stock that is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.08; and (h) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or would occur as a consequence thereof, make Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the securities or Property proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Parent or such Restricted Payment, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Section 4.10. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or suffer to exist, any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its Property (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Issue Date or thereafter 50
acquired, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, unless it has made or will make effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with (or, with respect to Subordinated Obligations, prior to) all other Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary secured by such Lien for so long as such other Debt is secured by such Lien. Section 4.11. Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock, or pay any Debt or other obligation owed, to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its Property to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary. The foregoing limitations will not apply: (1) with respect to clauses (a), (b) and (c), to restrictions: (A) in effect on the Issue Date, (B) relating to Debt or Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and existing at the time it became a Restricted Subsidiary if such restriction was not created in connection with or in anticipation of the transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company, or (C) resulting from the Refinancing of Debt Incurred pursuant to an agreement referred to in clause (1)(A) or (B) above or in clause (2)(A) or (B) below, provided such restriction is not materially less favorable to the Holders than those under the agreement evidencing the Debt so Refinanced, or (D) existing by reason of applicable law, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction, in each case issued or imposed by a governmental authority, or (E) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of Property in joint venture agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business; provided that such restrictions apply only to the assets or property subject to such joint venture; or (F) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth under contracts or leases entered into in the ordinary course of business; and (2) with respect to clause (c) only, to restrictions: 51
(A) relating to Debt that is permitted to be Incurred and secured without also securing the Notes pursuant to Sections 4.08 and 4.10 that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the Property securing such Debt, (B) encumbering Property at the time such Property was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as such restriction relates solely to the Property so acquired and was not created in connection with or in anticipation of such acquisition, (C) resulting from customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of leases or customary provisions in other agreements that restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder, or (D) customary restrictions contained in asset sale agreements limiting the transfer of such Property pending the closing of such sale. Section 4.12. Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary of the Company to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if: (a) the Subsidiary to be so designated does not own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any Property of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) either: (1) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of $1,000 or less, or (2) such designation is effective immediately upon such entity becoming a Subsidiary of the Company. Unless so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Company will be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that such Subsidiary shall not be designated a Restricted Subsidiary and shall be automatically classified as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if either of the requirements set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the second immediately following paragraph will not be satisfied after giving pro forma effect to such classification or if such Person is a Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Except as provided in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph of this Section, no Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In addition, no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall have any Debt other than Non-Recourse Debt. The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such designation, (x) the Company could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08, and (y) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom. 52
Any designation or redesignation by the Board of Directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a Board Resolution giving effect to such designation or redesignation and an Officers' Certificate that: (a) certifies that such designation or redesignation complies with the foregoing provisions, and (b) gives the effective date of such designation or redesignation, such filing with the Trustee to occur within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter of the Company in which such designation or redesignation is made (or, in the case of a designation or redesignation made during the last fiscal quarter of the Company's fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year). Section 4.13. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the purchase date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall: (a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be sent at least once to the Dow Jones News Service or a similar business news service in the United States; and (b) send, by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder, at such Holder's address appearing in the securities register maintained in respect of the Notes by the Registrar (the "Security Register"): (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to Section 4.13 of the Indenture and that all Notes timely tendered will be accepted for payment; (2) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the purchase date, which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed; (3) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the Change of Control (including information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control); and (4) the procedures that Holders must follow in order to tender their Notes (or portions thereof) for payment, and the procedures that Holders must follow in order to withdraw an election to tender Notes (or portions thereof) for payment. 53
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described hereunder, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of such compliance. Section 4.14. Covenant Removal. From and after the first date on which both: (a) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under this Indenture (collectively, a "Ratings Event"), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall cease to be subject to the following provisions of this Indenture (collectively, the "Removed Covenants"): (i) Section 4.08, (ii) Section 4.09, (iii) Section 4.11, (iv) clause (x) of the third paragraph (and such clause (x) as referred to in the first paragraph) of Section 4.12, and (v) clause (e) of Section 5.01. 54
The Removed Covenants shall not be reinstated even if the Company subsequent does not satisfy the requirements set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. Section 4.15. Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions. Upon and after the occurrence of a Ratings Event, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction covering any Property after the Issue Date unless: (a) the Sale and Leaseback Transaction: (1) involves a lease for a period, including renewals, of not more than three years; or (2) involves newly constructed Property, and the sale or transfer occurs within 120 days after the completion of construction and commencement of full operation thereof; provided, however, that if the Sale and Leaseback Transaction involves new construction on real property acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary more than 120 days prior to the date of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, then such Sale and Leaseback Transaction shall be deemed a permissible Sale and Leaseback Transaction under this clause (a)(2) but only to the extent of the value of the newly constructed Property; or (3) occurs within 120 days from the date of the acquisition of the Property subject thereto; or (4) is with the Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, within 120 days after the Sale and Leaseback Transaction shall have occurred, applies or causes to be applied an amount equal to the value of the Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such arrangement to the prepayment, repayment, redemption, reduction or retirement of any Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the Notes and that has a Stated Maturity of more than twelve months; or (c) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to Incur such Lien on the Property without equally and ratably securing the Notes in accordance with Section 4.10. ARTICLE 5. SUCCESSORS Section 5.01. Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Property. The Company shall not merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into any other Person (other than a merger of a Restricted Subsidiary into the Company) or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its Property in any one transaction or series of transactions unless: (a) the Company shall be the surviving Person (the "Surviving Person") or the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) formed by such merger, consolidation or 55
amalgamation or to which such sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or disposition is made shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia; (b) the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) expressly assumes, by agreements in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such Surviving Person, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, all the Notes, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement to be performed by the Company; (c) in the case of a sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all the Property of the Company, such Property shall have been transferred as an entirety or virtually as an entirety to one Person; (d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating, for purposes of this clause (d) and clause (e) below, any Debt that becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction or series of transactions), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (e) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis, (i) the Company or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, would be able to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08 or (ii) the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, would be equal to or greater than the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; and (f) the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such transaction and the agreements, if any, in respect thereto comply with this Section 5.01 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied. Section 5.02. Successor Corporation Substituted. The Surviving Person shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture, but the predecessor Company in the case of: (a) a sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or other disposition (unless such sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or other disposition is of all the assets of the Company as an entirety or virtually as an entirety), or (b) a lease, shall not be released from any of the obligations or covenants under this Indenture, including with respect to the payment of the Notes. 56
ARTICLE 6. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01. Events of Default. (a) An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company fails to make the payment of any interest or Additional Interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Company fails to make the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, on, any of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, required repurchase or otherwise; (3) the Company fails to comply with Article 5; (4) the Company fails to comply with any other covenant or agreement in the Notes or in this Indenture (other than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing clause (1), (2) or (3)) and such failure continues for 30 days after written notice is given to the Company as provided below; (5) a default occurs under any Debt by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that results in acceleration of the maturity of such Debt, or the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to pay any such Debt at maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $20.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time; (6) any final judgment or judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $20.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time) shall be rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and such judgment or judgments shall not be waived, satisfied or discharged for any period of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be in effect; (7) the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law: (i) commences a voluntary case, (ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (iii) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, (iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or (v) generally is not paying its debts as they become due; and 57
(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (i) is for relief against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries in an involuntary case; or (ii) appoints a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or (iii) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days. (b) A Default under clause (4) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default." Section 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to the Company), shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare to be immediately due and payable, by written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), the principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of acceleration. In the case of an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes will become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders. Holders may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes except as provided in this Indenture. Subject to the limitations described in this Article 6, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any) if the Trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the Holders' interest. Section 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. 58
Section 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest on, the Notes; provided, however, that after any acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium or interest or Additional Interest, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 6.05. Control by Majority. Subject to Section 7.01, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject to Section 7.07, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes. Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits. No Holder will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless: (a) such Holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, (b) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and (c) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days. The preceding limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for enforcement of payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest on, a Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note. A Holder may not use this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder. Section 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Note, on or after 59
the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(1) or (2) of Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. Section 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, respectively; and Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. 60
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10. Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. ARTICLE 7. TRUSTEE Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof. 61
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability.

The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. (g) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Section 7.10 and 7.11 hereof. Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision of this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication. Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders. Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with May 15, 2005, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (but if no event described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA Section 313(c). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA Section 313(d). The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange. 63
Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder in accordance with a written schedule provided by the Trustee to the Company. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee against any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, fines, liabilities or expenses, including incidental and out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys fees ("losses") incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any such losses may be attributable to its gross negligence or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim, and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law. The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable. Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section. The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if: 64
(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof; (b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law; (c) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. Subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof, the retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; provided, however, that all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder shall have been paid. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee. Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $150,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 310(b). 65
Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. ARTICLE 8. LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE Section 8.01. Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8. Section 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article 8. If the Company exercises under Section 8.01 hereof the option applicable to this Section 8.02, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof. Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.05, 4.06 and 4.08 through 4.14 hereof, and the operation of Section 5.01(e) hereof, with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Company 66
may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby. If the Company exercises under Section 8.01 hereof the option applicable to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(4) (with respect to the covenants contained in Sections 4.05, 4.06 and 4.08 through 4.15 hereof), (5), (6), (7) and (8) (but in the case of clauses (a) (7) and (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only or because of a failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(e)). Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof to the outstanding Notes. The Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance may be exercised only if: (a) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes to maturity; (b) the Company delivers to the Trustee a verification report of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest and Additional Interest, if any, when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest and Additional Interest, if any, when due on all the Notes to maturity; (c) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default described in clauses (a) (7) or (8) under Section 6.01 occurs with respect to the Company or any other Person making such deposit which is continuing at the end of the period; (d) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, no trust funds will be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally; (e) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; (f) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit and after giving effect thereto; (g) such deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement or instrument binding on the Company; 67
(h) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (i) in the case of the Legal Defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that: (1) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (2) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, to the effect, in either case, that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance has not occurred; (j) in the case of the Covenant Defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; and (k) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Notes have been complied with as required by this Indenture. Section 8.05. Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes. Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the certification delivered under Section 8.04(b) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. 68
Section 8.06. Repayment to Company. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder shall thereafter, as an unsecured creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be repaid to the Company. Section 8.07. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. ARTICLE 9. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders of Notes. Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes without the consent of any Holder to: (a) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in any manner that is not adverse in any material respect to any Holders, (b) provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company in accordance with this Indenture, (c) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), (d) add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to release Guarantors of the Notes from Guarantees with respect to the Notes as permitted by the terms of this Indenture, 69

Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders of Notes. Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture and the Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless such consent shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect. 70
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders to such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. Without the consent of each Holder, an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not: (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver, (b) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Interest on any Note, (c) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note, (d) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note, (e) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Interest on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes, (f) subordinate the Notes to any other obligation of the Company, (g) release any security interest that may have been granted in favor of the Holders other than pursuant to the terms of such security interest, or (h) make any change in the preceding amendment and waived provisions. Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect. Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. 71
Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. ARTICLE 10. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 10.01. Satisfaction and Discharge. This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, when: (a) either: (1) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity; (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound; 72
(c) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture; and (d) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity.

Section 10.03. Repayment to Company. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

The Issuer shall pay interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an "Interest Payment Date"). Interest on the Notes shall accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; provided, however, that if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date; provided further, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be July 15, 2005.

The Notes shall be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, at the office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose within or without the City and State of New York, or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the Security Register; provided, however, that payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds shall be required with respect to principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, and premium, if any, on, all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided wire transfer instructions to the Issuer or the Paying Agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such capacity. 4. Indenture.

The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling. The Indenture provides that an unlimited aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes may be issued thereunder. 5. Mandatory Redemption. The Issuer shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. 6. Denominations, Transfer, Exchange.

The Issuer need not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date. 7. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered holder of a Note may be treated as its owner for all purposes. 8. Amendment, Supplement and Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class, and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class. Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in any manner that is not adverse in any material respect to any Holder, provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture, provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to release Guarantors of the Notes from Guarantees with respect to the Notes as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, secure the Notes, to add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder, make any change to comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA or provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture. A-4
9. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default will occur under the Indenture if: (1) the Issuer fails to make the payment of any interest or Additional Interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Issuer fails to make the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, on, any of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, required repurchase or otherwise; (3) the Issuer fails to comply with Article 5; (4) the Issuer fails to comply with any other covenant or agreement in the Notes or in the Indenture (other than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing clause (1), (2) or (3)) and such failure continues for 30 days after written notice is given to the Issuer as provided in the Indenture; (5) upon a default under any Debt by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that results in acceleration of the maturity of such Debt, or the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to pay any such Debt at maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $20.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time; (6) any final judgment or judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $20.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time) shall be rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and such judgment or judgments shall not be waived, satisfied or discharged for any period of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be in effect; or (7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or the Significant Subsidiaries occurs. If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes shall become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or Additional Interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default. 10. Trustee Dealings with Issuer. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Issuer or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee. 11. No Recourse Against Others. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, of the Issuer, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes; such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. 12. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent. 13. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

If the Company defaults in a payment of interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, it shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, provided that no such special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed to Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid. Section 2.13. CUSIP or ISIN Numbers. The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers in any notices to the Holders as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers. Section 2.14. Additional Interest. If Additional Interest is payable by the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and paragraph 1 of the Notes, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate to that effect stating (i) the amount of such Additional Interest that is payable and (ii) the date on which such interest is payable. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such a certificate or instruction or direction from the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Additional Interest is payable. The foregoing shall not prejudice the rights of the Holders with respect to their entitlement to Additional Interest as otherwise set forth in this Indenture or the Notes and pursuing any action against the Company directly or otherwise directing the Trustee to take any such action in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Notes. If the Company has paid Additional Interest directly to the persons entitled to it, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth the particulars of such payment. 41

All such reports shall be prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission applicable to such reports.

In addition, following the consummation of the Exchange Offer contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, whether or not required by the Commission, the Company shall file a copy of all of the information and reports referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above with the Commission for public availability within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and regulations (unless the Commission will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request. The Company's reporting obligations with respect to clauses (a) and (b) above shall be deemed satisfied in the event the Company files such reports with the Commission on EDGAR and delivers a copy of such reports to the Trustees. If, at any time after consummation of the Exchange Offer contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, the Company shall nevertheless continue filing the reports specified 43
in the preceding paragraphs with the Commission, within the time periods specified above unless the Commission will not accept such a filing. The Company agrees that it will not take any action for the sole purpose of causing the Commission not to accept any such filings.

(a) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officers' Certificate stating that a review of the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the signing Officers with a view to determining whether the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating, as to each such Officer signing such certificate, that to the best of his or her knowledge the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of which he or she may have knowledge and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto) and that to the best of his or her knowledge no event has occurred and remains in existence by reason of which payments on account of the principal of or interest, if any, on the Notes is prohibited or if such event has occurred, a description of the event and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. (b) So long as not contrary to the then current recommendations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the year-end financial statements delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.03 above shall be accompanied by a written statement of the Company's independent registered public accountants (who shall be a firm of established national reputation) that in making the examination necessary for certification of such financial statements, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the Company has violated any provisions of Articles 4 or 5 hereof or, if any such violation has occurred, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof, it being understood that such accountants shall not be liable directly or indirectly to any Person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation. (c) The Company shall, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any event that with the giving of notice and the lapse of time would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. Section 4.05. Taxes. The Company shall pay, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay, prior to delinquency, all material taxes, assessments, and governmental levies except such as are contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings or where the failure to effect such payment is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. 44
Section 4.06. Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. Section 4.07. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each of its Significant Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes. Section 4.08. Limitation on Debt. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Debt (including any Acquired Debt) unless either: (1) such Debt is Debt of the Company and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio would be greater than 2.00 to 1.00; provided, that if the Debt which is the subject of a determination under this provision is Acquired Debt or Debt to be incurred in connection with the simultaneous acquisition of any Person, business or Property, then such ratio shall be determined on a pro forma basis, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the four quarter period used in the determination of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, or (2) such Debt is Permitted Debt. The term "Permitted Debt" is defined to include the following: (a) (i) Debt of the Company evidenced by the Notes issued on the Issue Date, the Exchange Notes or any new notes issued in exchange for Additional Notes, provided such new notes have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such Additional Notes and are issued pursuant to an exchange offer similar to the Exchange Offer; and (ii) Debt of the Company evidenced by the 2012 Notes issued on the Issue Date, the "Exchange Notes" (as defined in the 2012 Indenture) or any notes issued in exchange for "Additional Notes" (as defined in the 2012 Indenture), provided such new notes have terms substantially identical in all material 45
respects to such Additional Notes and are issued pursuant to an exchange offer similar to the "Exchange Offer" (as defined in the 2012 Indenture); (b) Debt of the Company under Credit Facilities, provided that the aggregate principal amount of all such Debt under Credit Facilities at any one time outstanding shall not exceed $300.0 million; (c) Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Capital Lease Obligations and Purchase Money Debt, provided that: (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Debt does not exceed the purchase price or cost of the Property acquired, constructed or leased, and (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Debt Incurred and then outstanding pursuant to this clause (c) (together with all Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred and then outstanding in respect of Debt previously Incurred pursuant to this clause (c)) does not exceed $100.0 million; (d) Debt of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary and Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any subsequent issue or transfer of Capital Stock or other event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of any such Debt (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Debt by the issuer thereof; provided further, that if the Company is the obligor on such Debt, such Debt must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes; (e) Debt representing Hedging Obligations entered into by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary for the purpose of fixing, hedging or swapping interest rate risk in the ordinary course of the financial management of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary and not for speculative purposes, provided that the obligations under such agreements are directly related to payment obligations on Debt otherwise permitted by the terms of this Section 4.08; (f) Debt in connection with one or more standby letters of credit or performance bonds issued by, or for the account of, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, workers' compensation claims, appeal bonds and warranty or contractual service obligations, or pursuant to self-insurance obligations and not in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit; (g) Debt of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date not otherwise described in clauses (a) through (f) above; (h) Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or otherwise became a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of the Company or was otherwise acquired by the Company), provided that at the time such 46
Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Company or otherwise became a Restricted Subsidiary and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt, the Company would have been able to Incur $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08; (i) Debt arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument (except in the case of daylight overdrafts) drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business, provided, however, that such Debt is extinguished within five business days of incurrence; (j) Debt arising from any agreement of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnities, guarantees, purchase price adjustments, holdbacks, contingency payment obligations based on the performance of the acquired or disposed assets or similar obligations (other than guarantees of Debt) Incurred by any Person in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary; (k) additional Debt of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $100.0 million in the aggregate; (l) Attributable Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in connection with any Sale and Leaseback Transaction in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $75.0 million in the aggregate; (m) additional Debt of the Company in an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $250.0 million; and (n) Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08 and clauses (a), (c), (g), (h), (k), (l), (m) and (n) above; provided in the case of Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in respect of Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (h), such Permitted Refinancing Debt may only be incurred by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.08, (a) the Company shall not Incur any Debt pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph of this Section 4.08 if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Subordinated Obligations unless such Debt shall be subordinated to the Notes to at least the same extent as such Subordinated Obligations, (b) the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to Incur any Debt pursuant to this Section 4.08 if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Debt of the Company, and (c) accrual of interest, accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Debt, will be deemed not to be an incurrence of Debt for purposes of this Section 4.08. For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.08, (i) in the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses 47
(a) through (m) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to clause (1) the first paragraph of this Section 4.08, the Company may, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify (in whole or in part) such item of Debt in any manner that complies with this Section 4.08 and such item of Debt will be treated as having been incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph hereof and (ii) for the purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Debt denominated in a foreign currency, the dollar-equivalent principal amount of such Debt incurred pursuant thereto shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the earlier of the date that such Debt was incurred, in the case of term Debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Debt; provided that if such Debt is incurred to refinance other Debt denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.08, the maximum amount of Debt that the Company may incur pursuant to this Section 4.08 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Debt incurred to refinance other Debt, if incurred in a different currency from the Debt being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing Debt is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Section 4.09. Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Company shall not make, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to make, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Payment if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such proposed Restricted Payment, (a) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (b) the Company could not Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08 or (c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments declared or made since the Start Date (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if made other than in cash, to be based upon the Fair Market Value at the time of such Restricted Payment) other than Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (b) through (g) of the next succeeding paragraph would exceed an amount equal to the sum of: (1) 50% of the aggregate amount of Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from the Start Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending at least 45 days prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or if the aggregate amount of Consolidated Net Income for such period shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit), plus (2) 100% of the Capital Stock Sale Proceeds, plus (3) the sum of: (A) the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance or sale after the Start Date of convertible or exchangeable Debt that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, and 48
(B) the aggregate amount by which Debt (other than Subordinated Obligations) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company's consolidated balance sheet on or after the Start Date upon the conversion or exchange of any Debt issued or sold on or prior to the Start Date that is convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company, excluding, in the case of clause (A) or (B): (x) any such Debt issued or sold to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Company or any such Subsidiary for the benefit of their employees, and (y) the aggregate amount of any cash or other Property distributed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary upon any such conversion or exchange, plus (4) an amount equal to the sum of: (A) the net reduction in Investments in any Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary resulting from dividends, repayments of loans or advances or other transfers of Property, in each case to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from such Person, and (B) the portion (proportionate to the Company's equity interest in such Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, provided, however, that the foregoing sum shall not exceed, in the case of any Person, the amount of Investments previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the Company may: (a) pay dividends on its Capital Stock within 60 days of the declaration thereof if, on said declaration date, such dividends could have been paid in compliance with this Indenture; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (b) purchase, repurchase, redeem, legally defease, acquire or retire for value Capital Stock of the Company or Subordinated Obligations in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Company or any such Subsidiary for the benefit of their employees); provided, however, that (1) such purchase, repurchase, redemption, legal defeasance, acquisition or retirement shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and 49
(2) the Capital Stock Sale Proceeds from such exchange or sale shall be excluded from the calculation pursuant to clause (c) (2) above; (c) purchase, repurchase, redeem, legally defease, acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Obligations in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Permitted Refinancing Debt; provided, however, that such purchase, repurchase, redemption, legal defeasance, acquisition or retirement shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; (d) repurchase shares of, or options to purchase shares of, common stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from current or former officers, directors or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or permitted transferees of such current or former officers, directors or employees), pursuant to the terms of agreements (including employment agreements) or plans (or amendments thereto) approved by the Board of Directors under which such individuals purchase or sell, or are granted the option to purchase or sell, shares of such common stock; provided, however, that: (1) the aggregate amount of such repurchases shall not exceed $5.0 million in any calendar year and (2) at the time of such repurchase, no other Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or result therefrom); provided further, however, that such repurchases shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; and (e) acquire its Capital Stock in connection with the exercise of warrants outstanding on the Start Date, stock options or stock appreciation rights by way of cashless exercise; and (f) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Company or an Restricted Subsidiary issued on or after the date of this Indenture in accordance with Section 4.08; (g) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of Disqualified Stock of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company made by exchange for, or out of the net proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale of Disqualified Stock that is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to Section 4.08; and (h) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, or would occur as a consequence thereof, make Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the securities or Property proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Parent or such Restricted Payment, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. Section 4.10. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or suffer to exist, any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its Property (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Issue Date or thereafter 50
acquired, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, unless it has made or will make effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with (or, with respect to Subordinated Obligations, prior to) all other Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary secured by such Lien for so long as such other Debt is secured by such Lien. Section 4.11. Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock, or pay any Debt or other obligation owed, to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (b) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary or (c) transfer any of its Property to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary. The foregoing limitations will not apply: (1) with respect to clauses (a), (b) and (c), to restrictions: (A) in effect on the Issue Date, (B) relating to Debt or Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and existing at the time it became a Restricted Subsidiary if such restriction was not created in connection with or in anticipation of the transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company, or (C) resulting from the Refinancing of Debt Incurred pursuant to an agreement referred to in clause (1)(A) or (B) above or in clause (2)(A) or (B) below, provided such restriction is not materially less favorable to the Holders than those under the agreement evidencing the Debt so Refinanced, or (D) existing by reason of applicable law, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction, in each case issued or imposed by a governmental authority, or (E) provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of Property in joint venture agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business; provided that such restrictions apply only to the assets or property subject to such joint venture; or (F) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth under contracts or leases entered into in the ordinary course of business; and (2) with respect to clause (c) only, to restrictions: 51
(A) relating to Debt that is permitted to be Incurred and secured without also securing the Notes pursuant to Sections 4.08 and 4.10 that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the Property securing such Debt, (B) encumbering Property at the time such Property was acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as such restriction relates solely to the Property so acquired and was not created in connection with or in anticipation of such acquisition, (C) resulting from customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of leases or customary provisions in other agreements that restrict assignment of such agreements or rights thereunder, or (D) customary restrictions contained in asset sale agreements limiting the transfer of such Property pending the closing of such sale. Section 4.12. Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary of the Company to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if: (a) the Subsidiary to be so designated does not own any Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any Property of, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, and (b) either: (1) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of $1,000 or less, or (2) such designation is effective immediately upon such entity becoming a Subsidiary of the Company. Unless so designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, any Person that becomes a Subsidiary of the Company will be classified as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that such Subsidiary shall not be designated a Restricted Subsidiary and shall be automatically classified as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if either of the requirements set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the second immediately following paragraph will not be satisfied after giving pro forma effect to such classification or if such Person is a Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Except as provided in the first sentence of the preceding paragraph of this Section, no Restricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In addition, no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall have any Debt other than Non-Recourse Debt. The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such designation, (x) the Company could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08, and (y) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom. 52
Any designation or redesignation by the Board of Directors pursuant to the foregoing provisions will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a Board Resolution giving effect to such designation or redesignation and an Officers' Certificate that: (a) certifies that such designation or redesignation complies with the foregoing provisions, and (b) gives the effective date of such designation or redesignation, such filing with the Trustee to occur within 45 days after the end of the fiscal quarter of the Company in which such designation or redesignation is made (or, in the case of a designation or redesignation made during the last fiscal quarter of the Company's fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year). Section 4.13. Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price (the "Change of Control Purchase Price") equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the purchase date (the "Change of Control Payment Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall: (a) cause a notice of the Change of Control Offer to be sent at least once to the Dow Jones News Service or a similar business news service in the United States; and (b) send, by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder, at such Holder's address appearing in the securities register maintained in respect of the Notes by the Registrar (the "Security Register"): (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to Section 4.13 of the Indenture and that all Notes timely tendered will be accepted for payment; (2) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the purchase date, which shall be, subject to any contrary requirements of applicable law, a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed; (3) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the Change of Control (including information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control); and (4) the procedures that Holders must follow in order to tender their Notes (or portions thereof) for payment, and the procedures that Holders must follow in order to withdraw an election to tender Notes (or portions thereof) for payment. 53
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful: (a) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (c) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described hereunder, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of such compliance. Section 4.14. Covenant Removal. From and after the first date on which both: (a) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under this Indenture (collectively, a "Ratings Event"), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall cease to be subject to the following provisions of this Indenture (collectively, the "Removed Covenants"): (i) Section 4.08, (ii) Section 4.09, (iii) Section 4.11, (iv) clause (x) of the third paragraph (and such clause (x) as referred to in the first paragraph) of Section 4.12, and (v) clause (e) of Section 5.01. 54
The Removed Covenants shall not be reinstated even if the Company subsequent does not satisfy the requirements set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. Section 4.15. Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions. Upon and after the occurrence of a Ratings Event, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction covering any Property after the Issue Date unless: (a) the Sale and Leaseback Transaction: (1) involves a lease for a period, including renewals, of not more than three years; or (2) involves newly constructed Property, and the sale or transfer occurs within 120 days after the completion of construction and commencement of full operation thereof; provided, however, that if the Sale and Leaseback Transaction involves new construction on real property acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary more than 120 days prior to the date of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, then such Sale and Leaseback Transaction shall be deemed a permissible Sale and Leaseback Transaction under this clause (a)(2) but only to the extent of the value of the newly constructed Property; or (3) occurs within 120 days from the date of the acquisition of the Property subject thereto; or (4) is with the Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, within 120 days after the Sale and Leaseback Transaction shall have occurred, applies or causes to be applied an amount equal to the value of the Property so sold and leased back at the time of entering into such arrangement to the prepayment, repayment, redemption, reduction or retirement of any Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not subordinated to the Notes and that has a Stated Maturity of more than twelve months; or (c) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to Incur such Lien on the Property without equally and ratably securing the Notes in accordance with Section 4.10. ARTICLE 5. SUCCESSORS Section 5.01. Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Property. The Company shall not merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into any other Person (other than a merger of a Restricted Subsidiary into the Company) or sell, transfer, assign, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its Property in any one transaction or series of transactions unless: (a) the Company shall be the surviving Person (the "Surviving Person") or the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) formed by such merger, consolidation or 55
amalgamation or to which such sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or disposition is made shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia; (b) the Surviving Person (if other than the Company) expressly assumes, by agreements in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such Surviving Person, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, all the Notes, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement to be performed by the Company; (c) in the case of a sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all the Property of the Company, such Property shall have been transferred as an entirety or virtually as an entirety to one Person; (d) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating, for purposes of this clause (d) and clause (e) below, any Debt that becomes, or is anticipated to become, an obligation of the Surviving Person or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been Incurred by the Surviving Person or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction or series of transactions), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (e) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma basis, (i) the Company or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, would be able to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt pursuant to the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4.08 or (ii) the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio for the Company or the Surviving Person, as the case may be, would be equal to or greater than the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; and (f) the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such transaction and the agreements, if any, in respect thereto comply with this Section 5.01 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied. Section 5.02. Successor Corporation Substituted. The Surviving Person shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture, but the predecessor Company in the case of: (a) a sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or other disposition (unless such sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance or other disposition is of all the assets of the Company as an entirety or virtually as an entirety), or (b) a lease, shall not be released from any of the obligations or covenants under this Indenture, including with respect to the payment of the Notes. 56
ARTICLE 6. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01. Events of Default. (a) An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company fails to make the payment of any interest or Additional Interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Company fails to make the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, on, any of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, required repurchase or otherwise; (3) the Company fails to comply with Article 5; (4) the Company fails to comply with any other covenant or agreement in the Notes or in this Indenture (other than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing clause (1), (2) or (3)) and such failure continues for 30 days after written notice is given to the Company as provided below; (5) a default occurs under any Debt by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that results in acceleration of the maturity of such Debt, or the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to pay any such Debt at maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $20.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time; (6) any final judgment or judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $20.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time) shall be rendered against the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and such judgment or judgments shall not be waived, satisfied or discharged for any period of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be in effect; (7) the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law: (i) commences a voluntary case, (ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (iii) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, (iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or (v) generally is not paying its debts as they become due; and 57
(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (i) is for relief against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries in an involuntary case; or (ii) appoints a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or (iii) orders the liquidation of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days. (b) A Default under clause (4) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default." Section 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to the Company), shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare to be immediately due and payable, by written notice to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), the principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the date of acceleration. In the case of an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to the Company or any Significant Subsidiary shall occur, such amount with respect to all the Notes will become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or the Holders. Holders may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes except as provided in this Indenture. Subject to the limitations described in this Article 6, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any) if the Trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the Holders' interest. Section 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. 58
Section 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest on, the Notes; provided, however, that after any acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium or interest or Additional Interest, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 6.05. Control by Majority. Subject to Section 7.01, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject to Section 7.07, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes. Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits. No Holder will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy thereunder, unless: (a) such Holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, (b) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and (c) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days. The preceding limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for enforcement of payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest on, a Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note. A Holder may not use this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder. Section 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Note, on or after 59
the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(1) or (2) of Section 6.01 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. Section 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, respectively; and Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. 60
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10. Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. ARTICLE 7. TRUSTEE Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (i) the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof. 61
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture at the request of any Holders, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

(c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.

(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. (g) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Section 7.10 and 7.11 hereof. Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision of this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication. Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders. Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with May 15, 2005, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (but if no event described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA Section 313(c). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA Section 313(d). The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange. 63
Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder in accordance with a written schedule provided by the Trustee to the Company. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee against any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, fines, liabilities or expenses, including incidental and out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys fees ("losses") incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any such losses may be attributable to its gross negligence or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim, and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law. The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable. Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section. The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if: 64
(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof; (b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law; (c) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. Subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof, the retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; provided, however, that all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder shall have been paid. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee. Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8. Section 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article 8. If the Company exercises under Section 8.01 hereof the option applicable to this Section 8.02, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof. Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.05, 4.06 and 4.08 through 4.14 hereof, and the operation of Section 5.01(e) hereof, with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Company 66
may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby. If the Company exercises under Section 8.01 hereof the option applicable to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clauses (a)(4) (with respect to the covenants contained in Sections 4.05, 4.06 and 4.08 through 4.15 hereof), (5), (6), (7) and (8) (but in the case of clauses (a) (7) and (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only or because of a failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(e)). Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof to the outstanding Notes. The Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance may be exercised only if: (a) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes to maturity; (b) the Company delivers to the Trustee a verification report of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest and Additional Interest, if any, when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest and Additional Interest, if any, when due on all the Notes to maturity; (c) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default described in clauses (a) (7) or (8) under Section 6.01 occurs with respect to the Company or any other Person making such deposit which is continuing at the end of the period; (d) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, no trust funds will be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally; (e) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; (f) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit and after giving effect thereto; (g) such deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement or instrument binding on the Company; 67
(h) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (i) in the case of the Legal Defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that: (1) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (2) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, to the effect, in either case, that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance has not occurred; (j) in the case of the Covenant Defeasance option, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; and (k) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Notes have been complied with as required by this Indenture. Section 8.05. Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes. Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the certification delivered under Section 8.04(b) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. 68
Section 8.06. Repayment to Company. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder shall thereafter, as an unsecured creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be repaid to the Company. Section 8.07. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States dollars or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. ARTICLE 9. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders of Notes. Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes without the consent of any Holder to: (a) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in any manner that is not adverse in any material respect to any Holders, (b) provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Company in accordance with this Indenture, (c) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), (d) add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to release Guarantors of the Notes from Guarantees with respect to the Notes as permitted by the terms of this Indenture, 69
(e) secure the Notes, to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company, (f) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holders, (g) make any change to comply with any requirement of the Commission in connection with the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; or (h) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with this Indenture. Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders of Notes. Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture and the Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless such consent shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect. 70
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders to such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. Without the consent of each Holder, an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not: (a) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver, (b) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Interest on any Note, (c) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note, (d) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note, (e) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Interest on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes, (f) subordinate the Notes to any other obligation of the Company, (g) release any security interest that may have been granted in favor of the Holders other than pursuant to the terms of such security interest, or (h) make any change in the preceding amendment and waived provisions. Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect. Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. 71
Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. ARTICLE 10. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 10.01. Satisfaction and Discharge. This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, when: (a) either: (1) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity; (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound; 72
(c) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture; and (d) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity. The Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Section 10.02. Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

Section 10.03. Repayment to Company. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

The Issuer need not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date. 7.

A-4
9. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default will occur under the Indenture if: (1) the Issuer fails to make the payment of any interest or Additional Interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Issuer fails to make the payment of any principal of, or premium, if any, on, any of the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon acceleration, required repurchase or otherwise; (3) the Issuer fails to comply with Article 5; (4) the Issuer fails to comply with any other covenant or agreement in the Notes or in the Indenture (other than a failure that is the subject of the foregoing clause (1), (2) or (3)) and such failure continues for 30 days after written notice is given to the Issuer as provided in the Indenture; (5) upon a default under any Debt by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that results in acceleration of the maturity of such Debt, or the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to pay any such Debt at maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than $20.0 million or its foreign currency equivalent at the time; (6) any final judgment or judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $20.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time) shall be rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and such judgment or judgments shall not be waived, satisfied or discharged for any period of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be in effect; or (7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or the Significant Subsidiaries occurs. If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes shall become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or Additional Interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Interest on, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default. 10. Trustee Dealings with Issuer. The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Issuer or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee. 11. No Recourse Against Others. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, of the Issuer, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes; such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. 12. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent. 13. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act). A-5
14. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon. The Issuer shall furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to: Coventry Health Care, Inc. 6705 Rockledge Drive, Suite 900 Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention: Chief Financial Officer A-6

SECTION 2. HOLDERS A Person is deemed to be a holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (each, a "HOLDER") whenever such Person owns Transfer Restricted Securities. SECTION 3. REGISTERED EXCHANGE OFFER (a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted by applicable federal law (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below have been complied with), the Company shall (i) cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be filed with the Commission no later than 120 days after the Closing Date (such 120th day being the "FILING DEADLINE"), (ii) use their best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the Closing Date (such 180th day being the "EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE"), (iii) in connection with the foregoing, (A) file all pre-effective amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to cause it to become effective, (B) file, if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A under the Act and (C) cause all necessary filings, if any, in connection with the registration and qualification of the Exchange Notes to be made under the Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, commence and use all commercially reasonable efforts to Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall be on the appropriate form permitting (I) registration of the Exchange Notes to be offered in exchange for the Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities and (II) resales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers that tendered into the Exchange Offer Notes that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any its Affiliates) as contemplated by Section 3(c) below. (b) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously, and shall keep the Exchange Offer open for
4 a period of not less than (i) 20 business days or more than 45 days or (ii) if longer, the minimum period required under applicable federal and state securities laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Company shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. No securities other than the Exchange Notes shall be included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be Consummated on or prior to 30 Business Days after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event later than 30 business days thereafter (such 30th business day being the "CONSUMMATION DEADLINE"). (c) The Company shall include a "Plan of Distribution" section in the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and indicate therein that any Broker-Dealer who holds Transfer Restricted Securities that were acquired for the account of such Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any Affiliate of the Company), may exchange such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to such sales by such Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to permit such sales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer, except to the extent required by the Commission as a result of a change in policy, rules or regulations after the date of this Agreement. Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) and (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of one year from the date on which the Exchange Offer is Consummated or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto. The Company shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to such Broker-Dealers, promptly upon request, and in no event later than one day after such request, at any time during such period. SECTION 4. SHELF REGISTRATION (a) Shelf Registration. If (i) due to applicable law or interpretations thereof by the Commission's staff, the Company determines upon advice of its outside counsel that it is not permitted to effect the Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 3 hereof (after the Company has complied with the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) hereof); (ii) for any other reason the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective within 180 days
5 following the date of the original issuance of the Notes or the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 210 days following the date of the original issuance of the Notes; (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to Notes that are not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer and that are held by it following consummation of the Exchange Offer; (iv) any Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) of Transfer Restricted Securities is not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer or does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer other than by reason of such Holder being an Affiliate of the Company (it being understood that the requirement that a participating Broker-Dealer deliver the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement in connection with sales of Exchange Notes shall not result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"); or (v) in the case of any Initial Purchaser that participates in the Exchange Offer or acquires Exchange Notes from the Company as a result of its determination that it is not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer with respect to any unsold Notes, such Initial Purchaser does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Notes in exchange for Notes constituting any portion of an unsold allotment (it being understood that (x) the requirement that an Initial Purchaser deliver a Prospectus containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Act in connection with sales of Exchange Notes acquired in exchange for such Notes shall result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"; and (y) the requirement that a participating Broker-Dealer delivers a Prospectus in connection with sales of Exchange Notes acquired in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Notes acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities shall not result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"), the Company shall effect a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with subsection (b) below. (b) If required pursuant to subsection (a) above, (I) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, file with the Commission and thereafter shall use its best efforts to cause to be declared effective under the Act a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Notes or the Exchange Notes, as applicable, by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Notes or Exchange Notes held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder; and provided further, that with respect to Exchange Notes received by an Initial Purchaser in exchange for Notes constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, the Company may, if permitted by current interpretations by the Commission's staff, file a post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection with respect thereto, and any such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as so amended, shall be referred to herein as, and governed by the provisions herein applicable to, a Shelf Registration Statement. (II) the Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the Act, in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period of two years (as extended pursuant to Section 6(c)(i)hereof) from the date the
6 Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Notes or Exchange Notes, as applicable, covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (in any such case, such period being called the "SHELF REGISTRATION PERIOD"). The Company shall be deemed not to have used its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Notes or Exchange Notes covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Notes or Exchange Notes during that period, unless (A) such action is required by applicable law; or (B) such action is taken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including the acquisition or divestiture of assets, so long as the Company promptly thereafter complies with the requirements of Section 5(k) hereof, if applicable; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured. (III) the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, (A) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission; and (B) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (c) Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 20 days after receipt of a request therefor, the information specified in Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, of the Act for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to Additional Interest pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such information. By its acceptance of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading. SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL INTEREST If (a) on or prior to the 120th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, (b) on or prior to the 180th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, (c) on or prior to the 210th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer has been consummated nor the Shelf
7 Registration Statement has been declared effective, or (d) after either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, except as provided in Section 4(b)(II) hereof, such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of Notes or Exchange Notes in accordance with and during the periods specified in this Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (a) through (d), a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), interest ("ADDITIONAL INTEREST") will accrue on the principal amount of the Notes and the Exchange Notes (in addition to the stated interest on the Notes and Exchange Notes) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. Additional Interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period, but in no event shall such rate exceed 1.00% per annum. All accrued Additional Interest shall be paid to the Holders entitled thereto, in the manner provided for the payment of interest in the Indenture, on each Interest Payment Date, as more fully set forth in the Indenture and the Notes and the Exchange Notes. Notwithstanding the fact that any securities for which Additional Interest are due cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities, all obligations of the Company to pay Additional Interest with respect to securities shall survive until such time as such obligations with respect to such securities shall have been satisfied in full. SECTION 6. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES (a) Exchange Offer Registration Statement. In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company shall (i) comply with all applicable provisions of Section 6(c) below, (ii) use its best efforts to effect such exchange and to permit the resale of Exchange Notes by any Broker-Dealer that tendered Notes in the Exchange Offer that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of its market making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates) being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and (iii) comply with all of the following provisions: (A) If, following the date hereof there has been announced a change in Commission policy with respect to exchange offers such as the Exchange Offer, that in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company raises a substantial question as to whether the Exchange Offer is permitted by applicable federal law, the Company hereby agrees to seek a no-action letter or other favorable decision from the Commission allowing the Company to Consummate an Exchange Offer for such Transfer Restricted Securities. The Company hereby agrees to pursue the issuance of such a decision to the Commission staff level. In connection with the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees to take all such other actions as may be requested by the Commission or otherwise required in connection with the issuance of such decision, including without limitation (I) participating in telephonic conferences with the Commission staff, (II) delivering to the Commission staff an analysis prepared by counsel to the Company setting forth the legal bases, if any, upon which such counsel has concluded that such an Exchange Offer should be permitted and (III) diligently pursuing a resolution (which need not be favorable) by the Commission staff.
8 (B) As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (including, without limitation, any Holder who is a Broker-Dealer) shall furnish, upon the request of the Company, prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, a written representation to the Company (which may be contained in the letter of transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) to the effect that (I) it is not an Affiliate of the Company, (II) it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in, a distribution of the Exchange Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and (III) it is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its ordinary course of business. Each Holder using the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of the Exchange Notes will be required to acknowledge and agree that, if the resales are of Exchange Notes obtained by such Holder in exchange for Notes acquired directly from the Company or an Affiliate thereof, it (1) could not, under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement, rely on the position of the Commission enunciated in Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) and Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and similar no-action letters (including, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above), and (2) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such a secondary resale transaction must be covered by an effective Registration Statement containing the selling security holder information required by Item 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K (C) Prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a supplemental letter to the Commission (I) stating that the Company is registering the Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the Commission enunciated in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above, (II) including a representation that the Company has not entered into any arrangement or understanding with any Person to distribute the Exchange Notes to be received in the Exchange Offer and that, to the best of the Company's information and belief, each Holder participating in the Exchange Offer is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its ordinary course of business and has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Notes received in the Exchange Offer and (III) any other undertaking or representation required by the Commission as set forth in any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above, if applicable. (b) Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall: (i) comply with all the provisions of Section 6(c) and (d) below and use its best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof (as indicated in the information furnished to the Company pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof), and pursuant thereto the Company will prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
9 Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Act, which form shall be available for the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof within the time periods and otherwise in accordance with the provisions hereof; and (ii) issue, upon the request of any Holder or purchaser of Notes covered by any Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, Exchange Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and surrendered to the Company for cancellation; the Company shall register Exchange Notes on the Shelf Registration Statement for this purpose and issue the Exchange Notes to the purchaser(s) of securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement in the names as such purchaser(s) shall designate. (c) General Provisions. In connection with any Registration Statement and any related Prospectus required by this Agreement, the Company shall: (i) use its efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial statements for the period specified in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration Statement curing such defect, and, if Commission review is required, use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that it is in the best interests of the Company not to disclose the existence of, or facts surrounding, any proposed or pending material transaction or other material development involving the Company, the Company may allow a Shelf Registration Statement to fail to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein to be unusable as a result of such nondisclosure for up to ninety (90) days in any year during the two-year period of effectiveness required by Section 4 hereof; (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the applicable period set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as the case may be; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, and to comply fully with Rules 424, 430A and 462, as applicable, under the Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of
10 distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus; (iii) in connection with any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities that will result in such securities no longer being Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and to register such Transfer Restricted Securities in such denominations and such names as the selling Holders may request at least two business days prior to such sale of Transfer Restricted Securities; (iv) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject; (v) provide a CUSIP number for all Transfer Restricted Securities not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement covering such Transfer Restricted Securities and provide the Trustee under the Indenture with certificates for the Transfer Restricted Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company; (vi) otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally available to its security holders with regard to any applicable Registration Statement, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 (which need not be audited) covering a twelve-month period beginning after the effective date of the registration statement (as such term is defined in paragraph (c) of Rule 158 under the Act); and (vii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement required by this Agreement and, in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner. (d) Additional Provisions Applicable to Shelf Registration Statements and Certain Exchange Offer Prospectuses. In connection with each Shelf Registration Statement, and each Exchange Offer Registration Statement if and to the extent that an Initial Purchaser has notified the Company that it is a holder of Exchange Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities (for so long as such Exchange Notes are Transfer Restricted Securities or for the period provided in Section 3 hereof, whichever is shorter), the Company shall:
11 (i) advise each Holder promptly and, if requested by such Holder, confirm such advice in writing, (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to any applicable Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Act or of the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, (D) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) if any fact or event contemplated by Section 6(d)(i)(D) above shall exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (iii) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale, if any, before filing with the Commission, copies of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus included therein (except the Prospectus included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement at the time it was declared effective) or any amendments or supplements to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such Registration Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and comment of such Holders in connection with such sale, if any, for a period of at least five business days, and the Company will not file any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such documents incorporated by reference) to which such Holders shall reasonably object within five business days after the receipt thereof. A Holder shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing if such Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the Act; (iv) use all commercially reasonable efforts, promptly prior to the filing of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus, to provide copies of such document to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale, if any, make the Company's representatives available for discussion of such document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such document prior to the filing thereof as such Holders may reasonably request;
12 (v) make available, at reasonable times, for inspection by each Holder and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents of the Company and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Holder, attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto subsequent to the filing thereof and prior to its effectiveness; (vi) if requested by any Holders in connection with such exchange or sale, promptly include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as such Holders may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the "Plan of Distribution" of the Transfer Restricted Securities; and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company is notified of the matters to be included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; (vii) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale without charge, at least one copy of the Registration Statement, as first filed with the Commission, and of each amendment thereto, including all documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits (including exhibits incorporated therein by reference); (viii) deliver to each Holder without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder reasonably may request; the Company hereby consents to the use (in accordance with law) of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each selling Holder in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; (ix) upon the request of any Holder, enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements) and make such representations and warranties and take all such other actions in connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to any applicable Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by any Holder in connection with any sale or resale pursuant to any applicable Registration Statement. In such connection, the Company shall: (A) upon request of any Holder, furnish (or in the case of paragraphs (2) and (3), use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be furnished) to each Holder, upon Consummation of the Exchange Offer or upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be: (1) a certificate, dated such date, signed on behalf of the Company by (x) the President or any Vice President and (y) a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, confirming, as of the date thereof, the matters set forth in Section 6(a)(iv) of the Purchase Agreement and such other similar matters as such Holders may reasonably request;
13 (2) an opinion, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, of counsel for the Company covering customary matters and such other matters as the selling Holders may reasonably request; and (3) a customary comfort letter, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer, or as of the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, from the Company's independent accountants, in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings, and affirming the matters set forth in the comfort letters delivered pursuant to Sections 6(a)(v) and (vii) of the Purchase Agreement; and (B) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the selling Holders to evidence compliance with the matters covered in clause (A) above and with any customary conditions contained in any agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to this clause (ix); (x) prior to any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the selling Holders and their counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the selling Holders may request and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject; and (xi) provide promptly to each Holder, upon request, each document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (e) Restrictions on Holders. Each Holder's acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security constitutes such Holder's agreement that, upon receipt of the notice referred to in Section 6(d)(i)(C) or any notice from the Company of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 6(d)(i)(D) hereof (in each case, a "SUSPENSION NOTICE"), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement until (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(d)(ii) hereof, or (ii) such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (in each case, the "RECOMMENCEMENT DATE"). Each Holder receiving a Suspension Notice shall be required to either (I) destroy any Prospectuses, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession that have been replaced by the Company with a more recently dated Prospectus or (II) deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession of the Prospectuses covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of the Suspension Notice.
14 The time period regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days in the period from and including the date of delivery of the Suspension Notice to the date of delivery of the Recommencement Date. SECTION 7. REGISTRATION EXPENSES (a) All expenses incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses; (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including certificates for the Exchange Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of Prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and one counsel for the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (which shall be Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP or such other counsel as may be selected by a majority of such Holders); (v) all application and filing fees in connection with listing the Exchange Notes on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance). The Company will, in any event, bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company. (b) In connection with any Registration Statement required by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the Shelf Registration Statement), the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who are tendering Notes into in the Exchange Offer and/or selling or reselling Notes or Exchange Notes pursuant to the "Plan of Distribution" contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one counsel (who shall be Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP unless another firm shall be chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration Statement is being prepared). SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its directors, officers and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (including without limitation, any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could give rise to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
15 provided by the Company to any Holder or any prospective purchaser of Exchange Notes or registered Notes, or caused by any omission alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is based upon information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders (b) By its acquisition of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its respective directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and (b) hereof, a Holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
16 they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified, pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified, pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (A) effected with its written consent or (B) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than 20 business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (I) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (II) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their initial sale of Transfer Restricted Securities (or in the case of Exchange Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities, the sale of the Notes for which such Exchange Notes were exchanged) or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in such clause 8(d)(i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The Company and, by its acquisition of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
17 considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint. SECTION 9. RULE 144A AND RULE 144 The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (a) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (b) is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144. SECTION 10. FUTURE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES If, prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or prior to the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, any subsidiary of the Company executes a Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture, the Company shall cause such subsidiary to execute and deliver to the parties hereto a counterpart signature page to this Agreement and such subsidiary shall be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement as a "Guarantor." SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS (a) Remedies. The Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The
18 Company further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person that would require such securities to be included in any Registration Statement filed hereunder. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof. (c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 11(c)(i), the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Company or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver of or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer. (d) Third Party Beneficiary. The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the Initial Purchasers and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect their rights hereunder. (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telecopier, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (i) if to a Holder, at the address set forth on the records of the Registrar under the Indenture, with a copy to the Registrar under the Indenture; and (ii) if to the Company, at the address set forth in the Purchase Agremeent.

Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee at the address specified in the Indenture. (f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of the terms hereof or of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions on resale set forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Purchase Agreement, and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (i) Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (j) Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. (k) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the registration rights granted with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

SECTION 2. HOLDERS A Person is deemed to be a holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (each, a "HOLDER") whenever such Person owns Transfer Restricted Securities. SECTION 3. REGISTERED EXCHANGE OFFER (a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted by applicable federal law (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below have been complied with), the Company shall (i) cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be filed with the Commission no later than 120 days after the Closing Date (such 120th day being the "FILING DEADLINE"), (ii) use their best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the Closing Date (such 180th day being the "EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE"), (iii) in connection with the foregoing, (A) file all pre-effective amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to cause it to become effective, (B) file, if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A under the Act and (C) cause all necessary filings, if any, in connection with the registration and qualification of the Exchange Notes to be made under the Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, commence and use all commercially reasonable efforts to Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall be on the appropriate form permitting (I) registration of the Exchange Notes to be offered in exchange for the Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities and (II) resales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers that tendered into the Exchange Offer Notes that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any its Affiliates) as contemplated by Section 3(c) below. (b) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously, and shall keep the Exchange Offer open for
4 a period of not less than (i) 20 business days or more than 45 days or (ii) if longer, the minimum period required under applicable federal and state securities laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Company shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. No securities other than the Exchange Notes shall be included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be Consummated on or prior to 30 Business Days after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event later than 30 business days thereafter (such 30th business day being the "CONSUMMATION DEADLINE"). (c) The Company shall include a "Plan of Distribution" section in the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and indicate therein that any Broker-Dealer who holds Transfer Restricted Securities that were acquired for the account of such Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any Affiliate of the Company), may exchange such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to such sales by such Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to permit such sales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer, except to the extent required by the Commission as a result of a change in policy, rules or regulations after the date of this Agreement. Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Exchange Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of Exchange Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions of Section 6(a) and (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of one year from the date on which the Exchange Offer is Consummated or such shorter period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto. The Company shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to such Broker-Dealers, promptly upon request, and in no event later than one day after such request, at any time during such period. SECTION 4. SHELF REGISTRATION (a) Shelf Registration. If (i) due to applicable law or interpretations thereof by the Commission's staff, the Company determines upon advice of its outside counsel that it is not permitted to effect the Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 3 hereof (after the Company has complied with the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) hereof); (ii) for any other reason the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective within 180 days
5 following the date of the original issuance of the Notes or the Exchange Offer is not consummated within 210 days following the date of the original issuance of the Notes; (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to Notes that are not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer and that are held by it following consummation of the Exchange Offer; (iv) any Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) of Transfer Restricted Securities is not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer or does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer other than by reason of such Holder being an Affiliate of the Company (it being understood that the requirement that a participating Broker-Dealer deliver the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement in connection with sales of Exchange Notes shall not result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"); or (v) in the case of any Initial Purchaser that participates in the Exchange Offer or acquires Exchange Notes from the Company as a result of its determination that it is not eligible to participate in the Exchange Offer with respect to any unsold Notes, such Initial Purchaser does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Notes in exchange for Notes constituting any portion of an unsold allotment (it being understood that (x) the requirement that an Initial Purchaser deliver a Prospectus containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Act in connection with sales of Exchange Notes acquired in exchange for such Notes shall result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"; and (y) the requirement that a participating Broker-Dealer delivers a Prospectus in connection with sales of Exchange Notes acquired in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Notes acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities shall not result in such Exchange Notes being not "freely tradeable"), the Company shall effect a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with subsection (b) below. (b) If required pursuant to subsection (a) above, (I) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, file with the Commission and thereafter shall use its best efforts to cause to be declared effective under the Act a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Notes or the Exchange Notes, as applicable, by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Notes or Exchange Notes held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder; and provided further, that with respect to Exchange Notes received by an Initial Purchaser in exchange for Notes constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, the Company may, if permitted by current interpretations by the Commission's staff, file a post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection with respect thereto, and any such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as so amended, shall be referred to herein as, and governed by the provisions herein applicable to, a Shelf Registration Statement. (II) the Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the Act, in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period of two years (as extended pursuant to Section 6(c)(i)hereof) from the date the
6 Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Notes or Exchange Notes, as applicable, covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (in any such case, such period being called the "SHELF REGISTRATION PERIOD"). The Company shall be deemed not to have used its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Notes or Exchange Notes covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Notes or Exchange Notes during that period, unless (A) such action is required by applicable law; or (B) such action is taken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including the acquisition or divestiture of assets, so long as the Company promptly thereafter complies with the requirements of Section 5(k) hereof, if applicable; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with Section 5 hereof from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured. (III) the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, (A) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission; and (B) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (c) Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 20 days after receipt of a request therefor, the information specified in Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, of the Act for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall be entitled to Additional Interest pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such information. By its acceptance of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading. SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL INTEREST If (a) on or prior to the 120th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission, (b) on or prior to the 180th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, (c) on or prior to the 210th day following the original issue date of the Notes, neither the Exchange Offer has been consummated nor the Shelf
7 Registration Statement has been declared effective, or (d) after either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, except as provided in Section 4(b)(II) hereof, such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of Notes or Exchange Notes in accordance with and during the periods specified in this Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (a) through (d), a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), interest ("ADDITIONAL INTEREST") will accrue on the principal amount of the Notes and the Exchange Notes (in addition to the stated interest on the Notes and Exchange Notes) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. Additional Interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period, but in no event shall such rate exceed 1.00% per annum. All accrued Additional Interest shall be paid to the Holders entitled thereto, in the manner provided for the payment of interest in the Indenture, on each Interest Payment Date, as more fully set forth in the Indenture and the Notes and the Exchange Notes. Notwithstanding the fact that any securities for which Additional Interest are due cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities, all obligations of the Company to pay Additional Interest with respect to securities shall survive until such time as such obligations with respect to such securities shall have been satisfied in full. SECTION 6. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES (a) Exchange Offer Registration Statement. In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company shall (i) comply with all applicable provisions of Section 6(c) below, (ii) use its best efforts to effect such exchange and to permit the resale of Exchange Notes by any Broker-Dealer that tendered Notes in the Exchange Offer that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of its market making activities or other trading activities (other than Notes acquired directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates) being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and (iii) comply with all of the following provisions: (A) If, following the date hereof there has been announced a change in Commission policy with respect to exchange offers such as the Exchange Offer, that in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company raises a substantial question as to whether the Exchange Offer is permitted by applicable federal law, the Company hereby agrees to seek a no-action letter or other favorable decision from the Commission allowing the Company to Consummate an Exchange Offer for such Transfer Restricted Securities. The Company hereby agrees to pursue the issuance of such a decision to the Commission staff level. In connection with the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees to take all such other actions as may be requested by the Commission or otherwise required in connection with the issuance of such decision, including without limitation (I) participating in telephonic conferences with the Commission staff, (II) delivering to the Commission staff an analysis prepared by counsel to the Company setting forth the legal bases, if any, upon which such counsel has concluded that such an Exchange Offer should be permitted and (III) diligently pursuing a resolution (which need not be favorable) by the Commission staff.
8 (B) As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (including, without limitation, any Holder who is a Broker-Dealer) shall furnish, upon the request of the Company, prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, a written representation to the Company (which may be contained in the letter of transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) to the effect that (I) it is not an Affiliate of the Company, (II) it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in, a distribution of the Exchange Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and (III) it is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its ordinary course of business. Each Holder using the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of the Exchange Notes will be required to acknowledge and agree that, if the resales are of Exchange Notes obtained by such Holder in exchange for Notes acquired directly from the Company or an Affiliate thereof, it (1) could not, under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement, rely on the position of the Commission enunciated in Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) and Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and similar no-action letters (including, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above), and (2) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such a secondary resale transaction must be covered by an effective Registration Statement containing the selling security holder information required by Item 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K (C) Prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a supplemental letter to the Commission (I) stating that the Company is registering the Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the Commission enunciated in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above, (II) including a representation that the Company has not entered into any arrangement or understanding with any Person to distribute the Exchange Notes to be received in the Exchange Offer and that, to the best of the Company's information and belief, each Holder participating in the Exchange Offer is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its ordinary course of business and has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Notes received in the Exchange Offer and (III) any other undertaking or representation required by the Commission as set forth in any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (A) above, if applicable. (b) Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall: (i) comply with all the provisions of Section 6(c) and (d) below and use its best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof (as indicated in the information furnished to the Company pursuant to Section 4(c) hereof), and pursuant thereto the Company will prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
9 Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Act, which form shall be available for the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof within the time periods and otherwise in accordance with the provisions hereof; and (ii) issue, upon the request of any Holder or purchaser of Notes covered by any Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, Exchange Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and surrendered to the Company for cancellation; the Company shall register Exchange Notes on the Shelf Registration Statement for this purpose and issue the Exchange Notes to the purchaser(s) of securities subject to the Shelf Registration Statement in the names as such purchaser(s) shall designate. (c) General Provisions. In connection with any Registration Statement and any related Prospectus required by this Agreement, the Company shall: (i) use its efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial statements for the period specified in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration Statement curing such defect, and, if Commission review is required, use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that it is in the best interests of the Company not to disclose the existence of, or facts surrounding, any proposed or pending material transaction or other material development involving the Company, the Company may allow a Shelf Registration Statement to fail to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein to be unusable as a result of such nondisclosure for up to ninety (90) days in any year during the two-year period of effectiveness required by Section 4 hereof; (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the applicable period set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as the case may be; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, and to comply fully with Rules 424, 430A and 462, as applicable, under the Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of
10 distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus; (iii) in connection with any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities that will result in such securities no longer being Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and to register such Transfer Restricted Securities in such denominations and such names as the selling Holders may request at least two business days prior to such sale of Transfer Restricted Securities; (iv) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject; (v) provide a CUSIP number for all Transfer Restricted Securities not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement covering such Transfer Restricted Securities and provide the Trustee under the Indenture with certificates for the Transfer Restricted Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company; (vi) otherwise use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally available to its security holders with regard to any applicable Registration Statement, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 (which need not be audited) covering a twelve-month period beginning after the effective date of the registration statement (as such term is defined in paragraph (c) of Rule 158 under the Act); and (vii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement required by this Agreement and, in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner. (d) Additional Provisions Applicable to Shelf Registration Statements and Certain Exchange Offer Prospectuses. In connection with each Shelf Registration Statement, and each Exchange Offer Registration Statement if and to the extent that an Initial Purchaser has notified the Company that it is a holder of Exchange Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities (for so long as such Exchange Notes are Transfer Restricted Securities or for the period provided in Section 3 hereof, whichever is shorter), the Company shall:
11 (i) advise each Holder promptly and, if requested by such Holder, confirm such advice in writing, (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to any applicable Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Act or of the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, (D) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (ii) if any fact or event contemplated by Section 6(d)(i)(D) above shall exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (iii) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale, if any, before filing with the Commission, copies of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus included therein (except the Prospectus included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement at the time it was declared effective) or any amendments or supplements to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such Registration Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and comment of such Holders in connection with such sale, if any, for a period of at least five business days, and the Company will not file any such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such documents incorporated by reference) to which such Holders shall reasonably object within five business days after the receipt thereof. A Holder shall be deemed to have reasonably objected to such filing if such Registration Statement, amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the Act; (iv) use all commercially reasonable efforts, promptly prior to the filing of any document that is to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or Prospectus, to provide copies of such document to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale, if any, make the Company's representatives available for discussion of such document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such information in such document prior to the filing thereof as such Holders may reasonably request;
12 (v) make available, at reasonable times, for inspection by each Holder and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents of the Company and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Holder, attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto subsequent to the filing thereof and prior to its effectiveness; (vi) if requested by any Holders in connection with such exchange or sale, promptly include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as such Holders may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the "Plan of Distribution" of the Transfer Restricted Securities; and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Company is notified of the matters to be included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; (vii) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange or sale without charge, at least one copy of the Registration Statement, as first filed with the Commission, and of each amendment thereto, including all documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits (including exhibits incorporated therein by reference); (viii) deliver to each Holder without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder reasonably may request; the Company hereby consents to the use (in accordance with law) of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each selling Holder in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto; (ix) upon the request of any Holder, enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements) and make such representations and warranties and take all such other actions in connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to any applicable Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by any Holder in connection with any sale or resale pursuant to any applicable Registration Statement. In such connection, the Company shall: (A) upon request of any Holder, furnish (or in the case of paragraphs (2) and (3), use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be furnished) to each Holder, upon Consummation of the Exchange Offer or upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be: (1) a certificate, dated such date, signed on behalf of the Company by (x) the President or any Vice President and (y) a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, confirming, as of the date thereof, the matters set forth in Section 6(a)(iv) of the Purchase Agreement and such other similar matters as such Holders may reasonably request;
13 (2) an opinion, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, of counsel for the Company covering customary matters and such other matters as the selling Holders may reasonably request; and (3) a customary comfort letter, dated the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer, or as of the date of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, from the Company's independent accountants, in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in comfort letters to underwriters in connection with underwritten offerings, and affirming the matters set forth in the comfort letters delivered pursuant to Sections 6(a)(v) and (vii) of the Purchase Agreement; and (B) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the selling Holders to evidence compliance with the matters covered in clause (A) above and with any customary conditions contained in any agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to this clause (ix); (x) prior to any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the selling Holders and their counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the selling Holders may request and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject; and (xi) provide promptly to each Holder, upon request, each document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (e) Restrictions on Holders. Each Holder's acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security constitutes such Holder's agreement that, upon receipt of the notice referred to in Section 6(d)(i)(C) or any notice from the Company of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 6(d)(i)(D) hereof (in each case, a "SUSPENSION NOTICE"), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement until (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(d)(ii) hereof, or (ii) such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (in each case, the "RECOMMENCEMENT DATE"). Each Holder receiving a Suspension Notice shall be required to either (I) destroy any Prospectuses, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession that have been replaced by the Company with a more recently dated Prospectus or (II) deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession of the Prospectuses covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of the Suspension Notice.
14 The time period regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days in the period from and including the date of delivery of the Suspension Notice to the date of delivery of the Recommencement Date. SECTION 7. REGISTRATION EXPENSES (a) All expenses incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses; (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including certificates for the Exchange Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of Prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and one counsel for the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (which shall be Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP or such other counsel as may be selected by a majority of such Holders); (v) all application and filing fees in connection with listing the Exchange Notes on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance). The Company will, in any event, bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company. (b) In connection with any Registration Statement required by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the Shelf Registration Statement), the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities who are tendering Notes into in the Exchange Offer and/or selling or reselling Notes or Exchange Notes pursuant to the "Plan of Distribution" contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one counsel (who shall be Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP unless another firm shall be chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration Statement is being prepared). SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its directors, officers and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (including without limitation, any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could give rise to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto)
15 provided by the Company to any Holder or any prospective purchaser of Exchange Notes or registered Notes, or caused by any omission alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is based upon information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders (b) By its acquisition of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its respective directors and officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any Person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and (b) hereof, a Holder shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
16 they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified, pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified, pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (A) effected with its written consent or (B) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than 20 business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have failed to comply with such reimbursement request. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (I) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (II) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. (d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their initial sale of Transfer Restricted Securities (or in the case of Exchange Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities, the sale of the Notes for which such Exchange Notes were exchanged) or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in such clause 8(d)(i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The Company and, by its acquisition of Transfer Restricted Securities, each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
17 considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each Holder hereunder and not joint. SECTION 9. RULE 144A AND RULE 144 The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (a) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (b) is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144. SECTION 10. FUTURE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES If, prior to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or prior to the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, any subsidiary of the Company executes a Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture, the Company shall cause such subsidiary to execute and deliver to the parties hereto a counterpart signature page to this Agreement and such subsidiary shall be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement as a "Guarantor." SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS (a) Remedies. The Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The
18 Company further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person that would require such securities to be included in any Registration Statement filed hereunder. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof. (c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 11(c)(i), the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Company has obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Company or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver of or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange Offer. (d) Third Party Beneficiary. The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the Initial Purchasers and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect their rights hereunder. (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telecopier, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (i) if to a Holder, at the address set forth on the records of the Registrar under the Indenture, with a copy to the Registrar under the Indenture; and (ii) if to the Company, at the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee at the address specified in the Indenture. (f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities in violation of the terms hereof or of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Transfer Restricted Securities in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Transfer Restricted Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the restrictions on resale set forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Purchase Agreement, and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (i) Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (j) Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Term Lender severally agrees to make a term loan (a "Term Loan") to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the amount of the Term Commitment of such Lender. The Term Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.9. 2.2 Procedure for Term Loan Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date) requesting that the Term Lenders make the Term Loans on the Closing Date. The Term Loans made on the Closing Date shall initially be ABR Loans and, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, no Term Loan may be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period in excess of one month prior to the date that is three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date. Upon receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Term Lender thereof. Not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Closing Date each Term Lender shall
19 make available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the Term Loan or Term Loans to be made by such Lender. The Administrative Agent shall credit the account of the Borrower on the books of such office of the Administrative Agent, or as otherwise directed by the Borrower, with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Term Lenders in immediately available funds. 2.3 Repayment of Term Loans. The Term Loan of each Term Lender shall mature in 20 consecutive quarterly installments, each of which shall be in an amount equal to such Lender's Term Percentage multiplied by the amount set forth below opposite such installment: 2.4 Revolving Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Revolving Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans ("Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations then outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Revolving Commitment. During the Revolving Commitment Period the Borrower may use the Revolving Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The Revolving Loans may from time to time be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.9. (b) The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans on the Revolving Termination Date. 2.5 Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing. The Borrower may borrow under the Revolving Commitments during the Revolving Commitment Period on any Business Day, provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (a) prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, three Business Days prior to the
20 requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or (b) prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of ABR Loans), specifying (i) the amount and Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date and (iii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the respective amounts of each such Type of Loan and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor. Any Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date shall initially be ABR Loans and, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, no Revolving Loan may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period in excess of one month prior to the date that is three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date. Each borrowing under the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount equal to (x) in the case of ABR Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving Commitments are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender thereof. Each Revolving Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of such office, or as otherwise directed by the Borrower, with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. 2.6 Commitment Fees, etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee for the period from and including the date hereof to the last day of the Revolving Commitment Period, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates as set forth in any fee agreements with the Administrative Agent and to perform any other obligations contained therein. 2.7 Termination or Reduction of Revolving Commitments. The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving Commitments; provided that no such termination or reduction of Revolving Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and shall reduce permanently the Revolving Commitments then in effect. 2.8 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day prior thereto, in the case of ABR Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans or a combination thereof; provided, that if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.17. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
21 specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. 2.9 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor), provided that no ABR Loan under a particular Facility may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. (b) Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan under a particular Facility may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 2.10 Limitations on Eurodollar Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of Eurodollar Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than ten Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 2.11 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin. (b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. (c)(i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility plus 2%, and (ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or
22 any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2% (or, in the case of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility, the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility plus 2%), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand. 2.12 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate. (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.11(a). 2.13 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurodollar Loans.
23 2.14 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Term Percentages or Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the Term Lenders. The amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the then remaining installments of the Term Loans pro rata based upon the respective then remaining principal amounts thereof. Amounts prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed. (c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans then held by the Revolving Lenders. (d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders (or, if applicable, the Issuing Lender) promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower. (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
24 is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 2.15 Requirements of Law. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof: (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 2.16 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender); (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor (such request to include details reasonably sufficient to establish the basis for such additional costs), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
25 (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.15, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than ninety days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such ninety-day period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.16 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph. (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. (d)(i) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of
26 "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit E and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (ii) Each Non-U.S. Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the date when such Non-U.S. Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Administrative Agent (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender. (e) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction. (f) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender. (g) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent
27 or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (h) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including attorney fees) of the Administrative Agent. (i) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.17 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 2.18 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.15 or 2.16(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a). 2.19 Replacement of Lenders. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such
28 replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.18 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans, accrued interest, accrued fees and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.17 if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender. SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT 3.1 L/C Commitment. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Existing Issuing Lender has issued the Existing Letters of Credit which, from and after the Closing Date, shall constitute Letters of Credit hereunder. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (the letters of credit issued on and after the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 3, together with the Existing Letters of Credit, collectively, the "Letters of Credit") for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments would be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above). (b) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law. 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit. The Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in
29 turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof). 3.3 Fees and Other Charges. (a) The Borrower will pay a fee on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans under the Revolving Facility, shared ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit. 3.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage in the Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, upon demand, at the Funding Office an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, on demand, an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility. A certificate of the Issuing
30 Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and the Administrative Agent has received from any L/C Participant such L/C Participant's pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall be required to be returned by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such L/C Participant shall return to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the portion thereof previously distributed by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to it. 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. If any draft is paid under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Lender (through payment to the Administrative Agent) for the amount of (a) the draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such draft. Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, at the Funding Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (x) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice, Section 2.11(b) and (y) thereafter, Section 2.11(c). 3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower. 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including
31 each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 3.8 Applications. To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply. SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that: 4.1 Financial Condition. (a) The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2004 (including the notes thereto) (the "Pro Forma Balance Sheet"), copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, has been prepared giving effect (as if such events had occurred on such date) to (i) the consummation of the Acquisition, (ii) the Loans to be made and the Senior Notes to be issued on the Closing Date and the use of proceeds thereof and (iii) the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been prepared based on the best information available to the Borrower as of the date of delivery thereof, and presents fairly on a pro forma basis the estimated financial position of Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2004, assuming that the events specified in the preceding sentence had actually occurred at such date. (b) The audited consolidated balance sheets of each of the Borrower and First Health as at December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from Ernst & Young LLP, in the case of the Borrower, and Deloitte & Touche LLP, in the case of First Health, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of each of the Borrower and First Health as at such dates, and the consolidated results of their respective operations and their respective consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheets of each of the Borrower and First Health as at September 30, 2004, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine-month period ended on such date, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of each of the Borrower and First Health as at such date, and the consolidated results of their respective operations and their respective consolidated cash flows for the nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). During the period from December 31, 2003 to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by any Group Member of any material part of its business or property (other than the Acquisition). 4.2 No Change. Since December 31, 2003, there has been no development or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.3 Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Group Member (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged (including all governmental licenses, permits and other approvals, including all licenses, permits and approvals issued by the HMO
32 Regulators and the Insurance Regulators), (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other organization and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure of any of the statements set forth in this sentence to be true and correct could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Borrower and the Material Subsidiaries (a) is in compliance with all terms and provisions of HIPAA and of the HMO Regulations and Insurance Regulations pertaining to fiscal soundness, solvency or financial condition and (b) has not received any assertion in writing by an HMO Regulator or an Insurance Regulator that such Regulator is taking administrative action against the Borrower or such Material Subsidiary to (i) revoke or modify any contract of insurance, license, permit, certification, authorization, accreditation or charter or (ii) enforce the fiscal soundness, solvency or financial provisions or requirements of the HMO Regulations or Insurance Regulations against the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary, except where such failure so to comply or such administrative action, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The Borrower has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents and to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. The Borrower has taken all necessary organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required in connection with the Acquisition and the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except (a) consents, authorizations, filings and notices described in Schedule 4.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (b) consents, authorizations, filings and notices, the absence of which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Loan Document has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law). 4.5 No Legal Bar. The execution, including delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law (including any HMO Regulation or Insurance Regulation) or any material Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation. No Requirement of Law applicable to or Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.6 Litigation. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending on the date of this Agreement or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against any Group Member or against any of their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
33 4.7 No Default. No Group Member is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations to an extent that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 4.8 Ownership of Property; Liens. Each Group Member has title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other property, except where a failure to do so could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of such property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 7.3. 4.9 Intellectual Property. Each Group Member owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted, except where a failure to do so could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim. The use of Intellectual Property by each Group Member does not infringe on the rights of any Person in any material respect. 4.10 Taxes. Each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed all Federal, state and other material tax returns that are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the relevant Group Member). No tax Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge. 4.11 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans, and no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used (a) for "buying" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect (except in a manner that is not in violation of Regulation U) or (b) for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. 4.12 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA, and neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any material liability under ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.
34 4.13 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. The Borrower is not an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Borrower is not subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness. 4.14 Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in writing from time to time after the Closing Date, Schedule 4.14 sets forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and, as to each such Subsidiary, the percentage of each class of Capital Stock owned by any Group Member and whether such Subsidiary is an HMO Subsidiary or an Insurance Subsidiary. 4.15 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Term Loans shall be used to finance a portion of the Acquisition, to refinance the Indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the Existing First Health Credit Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans, and the Letters of Credit, shall be used to finance a portion of the Acquisition and for general corporate purposes. 4.16 Environmental Matters. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) the facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by any Group Member (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or concentrations and under circumstances that constitute or constituted a violation of, or could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law; (b) no Group Member has received or is aware of any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the business operated by any Group Member (the "Business"), nor does the Borrower have knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened; (c) Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location that could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that could give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law; (d) no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, under any Environmental Law to which any Group Member is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business; (e) there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to the operations of any Group Member in connection with the Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or in amounts or in a manner that could give rise to liability under Environmental Laws; (f) the Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance, and have in the last five years been in compliance, with all applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties or the Business; and
35 (g) no Group Member has assumed any liability of any other Person under Environmental Laws. 4.17 Accuracy of Information, etc. No statement or information contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Confidential Information Memorandum or any other document, certificate or statement furnished by or on behalf of any Group Member to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or any of them, for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such statement, information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the Confidential Information Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein, taken as a whole, not misleading. The projections and pro forma financial information contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. 4.18 Certain Documents. The Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a complete and correct copy of the Acquisition Documentation and the Senior Note Indentures, including any amendments, supplements or modifications with respect to any of the foregoing. SECTION 5. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 5.1 Conditions to Initial Extension of Credit.

Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower. SECTION 9. THE AGENTS 9.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 9.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. 9.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Group Member or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
49 Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Group Member. 9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans. 9.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 9.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Group Member or any affiliate of a Group Member, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Group Members and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Group Members and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative
50 Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Group Member or any affiliate of a Group Member that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 9.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 9.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Group Member as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity. 9.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
51 9.10 Documentation Agents and Syndication Agent. Neither the Documentation Agents nor the Syndication Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such. SECTION 10.

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant
52 Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to permit the refinancing, replacement or modification of all outstanding Term Loans (the "Refinanced Term Loans") with a replacement term loan tranche hereunder ("Replacement Term Loans"), provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loans, (b) the Applicable Margin for such Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans and (c) the Average Life of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the Average Life of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing. 10.2 Notices.

54 accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

55 (d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and that directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant complies with Sections 2.16(d) and (e) as though it were a Lender. (f)(i) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, (ii) any Lender that is a fund, trust or similar entity may assign or pledge all or any portion of the Loans held by it (and any Notes evidencing such Loans) to a trustee under any indenture to which such Lender is a party in support of its obligations to the trustee for the benefit of the applicable trust beneficiaries, and (iii) any Lender may pledge all or any portion of the Loans held by it (and any Notes evidencing such Loans) to its lenders for collateral security purposes; provided in each case that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (g) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue appropriate Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (f) above. (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 10.6(b). Each of the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or
56 expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance. 10.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a "Benefitted Lender") shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable pursuant to Section 8, receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 10.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.10 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

EXHIBIT 99.1 (COVENTRY HEALTH CARE LOGO) News Release 6705 Rockledge Drive, Suite 900 Bethesda, MD 20817-1850 (301) 581-0600 For Immediate Release Contact: Shawn M. Guertin Chief Financial Officer (301) 581-5701 John J. Stelben VP, Business Development (301) 581-5729 COVENTRY HEALTH CARE ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF FIRST HEALTH ACQUISITION Bethesda, Maryland (January 28, 2005) - Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) announced today that it has completed the acquisition of First Health Group Corp. Each outstanding share of First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9.375 cash and 0.1791 shares of Coventry common stock. In connection with the merger, Coventry is issuing approximately 16.5 million shares of its common stock to former First Health stockholders. In connection with the acquisition, Coventry entered into new senior, unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $300 million five-year term loan, all of which was drawn at closing, and a $150 million five-year revolving credit facility, of which $65 million was drawn at closing. Coventry also closed the previously announced private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5 7/8% senior notes due 2012 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 6 1/8% senior notes due 2015. The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of Coventry and rank equal in right of payment to all of Coventry's existing and future senior debt, including its existing 8.125% senior notes due 2012 and its new credit facilities. Coventry used the proceeds from the new credit facilities and senior notes, together with approximately $221 million of cash on hand, to fund the First Health acquisition, including the repayment of First Health's outstanding bank debt and related transaction expenses. "We are excited to close the First Health transaction and start a new chapter in Coventry's story of profitable growth," said Dale B. Wolf, Coventry's chief executive officer. "We have been working diligently with First Health since the transaction was announced on October 14, 2004 and are well down the path with our integration planning. I look forward to working with all employees of the new Coventry to continue our company's track record of providing value to our customers, profitable growth to our investors, and opportunities for our employees."

Actual performance may be significantly impacted by certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in Coventry's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, as filed with the SEC, and Coventry's Registration Statement on Form S-4, as filed with the SEC on November 9, 2004 and amended on December 23, 2004.
