Fourth Quarter Highlights:
As of December 31, 2004, Coventry had a total of 2.51 million members, an increase of 126,000 members, or 5.3%, over the prior year quarter and an increase of 63,000 members over the prior quarter. Organic member growth for the quarter was slightly positive bringing the full year total to 2.7%.
Membership.
Commercial risk yields rose to $231 PMPM (per member per month) in the quarter, an increase of 10.3% over the prior year quarter. The Company continues to expect the 2005 commercial risk yield increase, net of benefit buydowns, to be in the range of 10.0% to 11.0%.
Commercial Rate Increases.
MLR was 80.4% for the quarter, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Medicare results. MLR for the year was 80.5%, a 70 basis point improvement over 2003 primarily driven by commercial and Medicare results.
Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).
SG&A expenses were 11.3% of operating revenues for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior quarter and a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Full year controllable SG&A (total SG&A less broker commissions and premium taxes) expenses PMPM of $16.40 declined $0.03 or 0.2% versus the prior year.
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
Cash and investments grew to $1.73 billion during the quarter, up $321.8 million from prior year-end. Net Premium Accounts Receivable of $104.9 million represent 7.0 days of sales outstanding (DSO) with the commercial only DSO running at 6.0 days. Days in Claims Payable (DCP) were 55.8 compared to the prior quarter of 57.0. Reduction in DCP was primarily due to the effort to reduce large dollar claim inventory in advance of year-end and January open enrollment activities.
Balance Sheet.
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $106.6 million as compared to net income of $91.8 million. Cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $453.9 million as reported, and $492.4 million when adjusted for the timing of CMS premium payments, as compared to year-to-date net income of $337.1 million. Due to a change implemented by CMS in the timing of premium payments, cash flow from operations in 2004 included only 11 CMS premium payments versus 12 payments that are normally expected. Coventry received the twelfth payment in early January 2005.
Cash Flow.
First Health Update
        "I am encouraged thus far with our integration efforts," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "We have developed and begun implementation of detailed action plans that will enable us to achieve our financial goals, compete more effectively, and grow profitably across all business lines. While a great deal of work needs to be done, we have identified and are moving forward on a clear path to accomplish these goals."
Efforts are underway to improve First Health provider contracts in existing Coventry health plan markets. In addition, re-contracting of physician fee schedules in other markets has commenced. These efforts are designed to improve the attractiveness of existing First Health networks in order to grow fee-based revenues through retention of existing and attraction of new customers.

Overall revenue for 2005 for the First Health businesses is expected to be between $885 million and $905 million on a full year basis.
