Bethesda, Maryland (May 3, 2005)  Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Operating revenues totaled $1.57 billion for the quarter, a 21.5% increase over the first quarter of 2004.

The quarter includes results from Coventry's First Health acquisition for the period from when the transaction closed on January 28, 2005 through March 31, 2005.
 
"I am delighted with the progress our Company made in the first quarter of 2005," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "Our health plan earnings came in slightly ahead of plan, First Health revenue is settling in as expected, and operations and expense reduction progress is either at or ahead of schedule in almost all areas. Overall, our opportunities and prospects have never been better."
