Coventry Health Care Reports Record Third Quarter Earnings of $0.81 per Diluted Share
 
Diluted EPS Up 27% Over Prior Year Quarter
 
Bethesda, Maryland (October 25, 2005)  Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. Operating revenues totaled $1.67 billion for the quarter, a 25.9% increase over the third quarter of 2004. Net earnings were $133.1 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, a 52.9% increase over net earnings for the third quarter of 2004 and a 26.6% increase on a per diluted share basis.
These results are reported on the basis of Coventry's recently effective three-for-two stock split which was distributed to shareholders on October 17, 2005.
 
"I am delighted to announce another quarter of strong financial results. The Health Plan business continues to perform well, including growth of 39,000 members during the quarter, and First Health continues to perform well both financially and operationally," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "We are also very proud of our employees in the New Orleans region who serve our Louisiana members in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Overall, the parts are in place for a strong finish to 2005 and the prospects for 2006 look promising."

Review of Coventry Louisiana Business in light of Hurricane Katrina
 
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused significant destruction and flooding in the Southern Louisiana and Mississippi regions, most notably in the greater New Orleans area. Coventry operates a local health plan in Louisiana covering approximately 76,000 members and employing 56 Louisiana residents. Of the 76,000 members, approximately 63,000 are in the greater New Orleans area. The monthly revenue generated by the Louisiana health plan prior to Hurricane Katrina was approximately $19 million, or approximately 3.4% of Coventry's total revenue. As outlined in the Coventry press release on September 7, 2005, certain steps have been taken to ensure continuity of operations and to comply with respect to temporary requirements imposed by the Louisiana Department of Insurance. Although Coventry did not incur a loss with respect to its Louisiana operations in the third quarter of 2005, a net loss in its Louisiana operations of ($0.03) to ($0.05) is possible in the fourth quarter of 2005. The guidance below incorporates the anticipated effect of Katrina in both 2005 and 2006.
