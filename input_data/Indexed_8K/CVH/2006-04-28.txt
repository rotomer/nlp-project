Bethesda, Maryland (April 28, 2006)  Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Operating revenues reached a record $1.94 billion for the quarter with net earnings of $121.0 million, or $0.74 per diluted share.

"I am delighted with the performance of our Company in the first quarter of 2006," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "Our health plan business is a consistent performer, and we continue to realize earnings and cash flow leverage from our fee-based businesses. Furthermore, we successfully implemented Medicare Part D in the first quarter, and the business is operationally and financially on track. Overall, our opportunities and prospects are outstanding and we look forward to a successful 2006."
