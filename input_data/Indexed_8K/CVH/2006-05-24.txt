SECTION
 2.  
Administration.
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Each member of the Committee shall be an Independent Director. The Committee shall have authority to grant, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, to officers, other key employees, Outside Directors and consultants eligible under Section 4: (i) Stock Options, (ii) Stock Appreciation Rights, (iii) Restricted Stock, (iv) Performance Awards and/or (v) Other Stock-Based Awards; provided, however, that the power to grant and establish the terms and conditions of awards to Outside Directors under the Plan other than pursuant to Section 11 shall be reserved to the Board.
 
In particular, the Committee, or the Board, as the case may be, shall have the authority, consistent with the terms of the Plan:
 
(a) to select the officers, key employees and Outside Directors of and consultants to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Performance Awards, and/or Other Stock-Based Awards may from time to time be granted hereunder;
 
(b) to determine whether and to what extent Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Performance Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards, or any combination thereof, are to be granted hereunder to one or more eligible persons;
 
(c) to determine the number of shares to be covered by each such award granted hereunder;
 
(d) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, the share price and any restriction or limitation, performance requirement or any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions regarding any Stock Option or other award and/or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion); and to amend or waive any such terms and conditions to the extent permitted by Section 13 hereof;
 
(e) to determine whether and under what circumstances a Stock Option may be settled in cash or Restricted Stock under Section 5(l) or (m), as applicable, instead of Common Stock;
 
 
 
 
(f) to determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances Option grants and/or other awards under the Plan are to be made, and operate, on a tandem basis vis-a-vis other awards under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan;
 
(g) to determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances shares of Common Stock and other amounts payable with respect to an award under this Plan shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the participant (including providing for and determining the amount (if any) of any deemed earnings on any deferred amount during any deferral period);
 
(h) to determine whether to require payment of tax withholding requirements in shares of Common Stock subject to the award; and
 
(i) to impose any holding period required to satisfy Section 16 under the Exchange Act.
 
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt, alter, and repeal such rules, guidelines, and practices governing the Plan as it shall, from time to time, deem advisable; to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any award issued under the Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.
 
All decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be made in the Committee's sole discretion and shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company and Plan participants.
 
 
 
 
SECTION
 3.  
Shares of Common Stock Subject to Plan.
 
(a) The maximum number shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to awards under this Plan and the Company's Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan and the Assumed Plans as defined therein (collectively, the "1998 Plan") shall be 18,000,000 shares plus any shares that are available or may become available at any time under the 1998 Plan, subject to adjustments set forth herein. No further grants may be made under the 1998 Plan.
 
(b) The shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. No officer of the Company or other person whose compensation may be subject to the limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be eligible to receive awards pursuant to this Plan in excess of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in any fiscal year (the "Section 162(m) Maximum").
 
(c) If any shares of Common Stock that have been optioned hereunder cease to be subject to such option, or if any shares of Common Stock that are subject to any Restricted Stock, Performance Awards settled in stock or Other Stock-Based Award granted hereunder are forfeited, or any such award otherwise terminates without a payment being made to the participant in the form of Common Stock, such shares shall again be available for distribution in connection with future awards under the Plan, so long as the total does not exceed the number specified in 3(a) above.
 
(d) Awards other than Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall be counted against the maximum number of shares available for grant in a 1.75-to-1 ratio.
 
(e) In the event the Committee determines that any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, extraordinary cash dividend, stock dividend, stock split or other change in corporate structure affecting the Common Stock or other similar corporate transaction affects shares of Common Stock such than an adjustment is determined by the Committee in its sole discretion to be appropriate, an appropriate substitution or adjustment shall be made in the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the Plan, in the number and option price of shares subject to outstanding Options granted under the Plan, in the number of shares underlying Outside Director Stock Options to be granted under Section 11 hereof, the Section 162(m) Maximum and in the number of shares subject to other outstanding awards granted under the Plan as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that the number of shares subject to any award shall always be a whole number. An adjusted option price shall also be used to determine the amount payable by the Company upon the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right.
 
SECTION
 4.  
Eligibility.
 
Officers, other key employees and Outside Directors of and consultants to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth and/or profitability of the business of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates are eligible to be granted awards under the Plan. Outside Directors are eligible to receive awards pursuant to Section 11 and as otherwise determined by the Board.
 
SECTION
 5.  
Stock Options.
 
Stock Options may be granted alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.
 
Stock Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock Options and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to individuals who are employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
 
 
 
 
The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any optionee Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock Options.
 
Options granted to officers, key employees, Outside Directors and consultants under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable.
 
 
 
 
(a) 
Option Price.
  The option price per share of Common Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant but shall be not less than 100% (or, in the case of any employee who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, not less than 110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at grant, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, and not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at grant, in the case of Non-Qualified Stock Options.
 
(b) 
Option Term.
  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years (or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option issued to an employee who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or parent corporations, more than five years) after the date the Option is granted.
 
(c) 
Exercisability.
  Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at or after grant; provided, however, that except as provided in Section 5(g) and (h) and Section 12, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at or after grant, no Stock Option shall be exercisable prior to the first anniversary date of the granting of the Option. The Committee may provide that a Stock Option shall vest over a period of future service at a rate specified at the time of grant, or that the Stock Option is exercisable only in installments. If the Committee provides, in its sole discretion, that any Stock Option is exercisable only in installments, the Committee may waive such installment exercise provisions at any time at or after grant, in whole or in part, based on such factors as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
(d) 
Method of Exercise.
  Subject to whatever installment exercise restrictions apply under Section 5(c), Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, either by check, by wire transfer, or such other form of funds transfer as the Committee may accept. As determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) after grant, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of shares of Common Stock already owned for at least six months by the optionee. In the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, the Committee, in its discretion, at or after grant, may permit option holders, in lieu of the payment of withholding taxes due, but only to the extent the Company is required to withhold such taxes, to surrender shares subject to purchase without restriction under such Option or another award hereunder (in each case valued at the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Option is exercised). No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall generally have the rights to dividends or other rights of a shareholder with respect to shares subject to the Option when the optionee has given written notice of exercise, has paid in full for such shares, and, if requested, has given the representation described in Section 15(a).
 
(e) 
Transferability of Options.
  No Non-Qualified Stock Option shall be transferable by the optionee other than (i) transfers by the optionee to a member of his or her Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of the optionee or a member of his or her Immediate Family, or (ii) transfers by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No Incentive Stock Option shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and all Incentive Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee. Following any such transfer, any transferred Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as in effect prior to transfer.
 
(f) 
Bonus for Taxes.
  In the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option or an optionee who elects to make a disqualifying disposition (as defined in Section 422(a)(1) of the Code) of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option, the Committee in its discretion may award at the time of grant or thereafter the right to receive upon exercise of such Stock Option a cash bonus calculated to pay part or all of the federal and state, if any, income tax incurred by the optionee upon such exercise.
 
 
 
 
(g) 
Termination by Death.
  Subject to Section 5(k), if an optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) Affiliate terminates by reason of death, any Stock Options held by such optionee shall vest in full and may thereafter be exercised by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the optionee under the will of the optionee, for a period of one year (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after grant) from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter.
 
(h) 
Termination by Reason of Disability.
  Subject to Section 5(k), if an optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) Affiliate terminates by reason of Disability, any Stock Options held by such optionee shall vest in full and may thereafter be exercised by the optionee for a period of (i) three years (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after grant) from the date of such termination of employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter, in the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option and (ii) one year from the date of termination of employment or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is shorter, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option; provided, however, that, if the optionee dies within the period specified in (i) above (or other such period as the Committee shall specify at or after grant), any unexercised Non-Qualified Stock Option held by such optionee shall thereafter be exercisable for a period of twelve months from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is shorter. In the event of termination of employment by reason of Disability, if an Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise period applicable to Incentive Stock Options, but before the expiration of any period that would apply if such Stock Option were a Non-Qualified Stock Option, such Stock Option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
(i) 
Termination by Reason of Retirement.
  Subject to Section 5(k), if an optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) Affiliate terminates by reason of Normal or Early Retirement, any Stock Option held by such optionee may thereafter be exercised by the optionee, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such Retirement or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) on such accelerated basis as the Committee may determine at or after grant (or, except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, as may be determined in accordance with procedures established by the Committee), for a period of (i) three years (or such other period as the Committee may specify at or after grant) from the date of such termination of employment or the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter, in the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option and (ii) ninety (90) days from the date of such termination of employment or the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is the shorter, in the event of an Incentive Stock Option; provided however, that, if the optionee dies within the period specified in (i) above (or other such period as the Committee shall specify at or after grant), any unexercised Non-Qualified Stock Option held by such optionee shall thereafter be exercisable to the extent to which it was exercisable at the time of death for a period of twelve months from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option, whichever period is shorter. In the event of termination of employment by reason of Retirement, if an Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise period applicable to Incentive Stock Options, but before the expiration of the period that would apply if such Stock Option were a Non-Qualified Stock Option, the option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
 
 
 
(j) 
Other Termination.
  Subject to Section 5(k), unless otherwise determined by the Committee (or pursuant to procedures established by the Committee) at or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) after grant, if an optionee's employment by the Company and any Subsidiary or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) Affiliate is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than death, Disability or Normal or Early Retirement, the Stock Option shall thereupon terminate, except that such Stock Option may be exercised, to the extent otherwise then exercisable, for the lesser of ninety (90) days or the balance of such Stock Option's term if the involuntary termination is without Cause. For purposes of this Plan, "Cause" means termination by the Company, acting in good faith, by written notice to the Executive specifying the event relied upon for such termination, due to; (i) the Executive's indictment or conviction of a felony, (ii) the Executive's intentional perpetration of a fraud, theft, embezzlement or other acts of dishonesty, (iii) the Executive's intentional breach of a trust or fiduciary duty which materially adversely affects the Company or its shareholders. If an optionee voluntarily terminates employment with the Company and any Subsidiary or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) Affiliate (except for Disability, Normal or Early Retirement), the Stock Option shall thereupon terminate; provided, however, that the Committee at grant or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) thereafter may extend the exercise period in this situation for the lesser of ninety (90) days or the balance of such Stock Option's term.
 
(k) 
Incentive Stock Options.
  Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended, or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code, or, without the consent of the optionee(s) affected, to disqualify any Incentive Stock Option under such Section 422. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any participant under the Plan if such grant would cause the aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by such participant during any calendar year (under all such plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) to exceed $100,000. To the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code or the applicable regulations thereunder or any applicable Internal Revenue Service pronouncement:
 
(i) if (x) a participant's employment is terminated by reason of death, Disability, or Retirement and (y) the portion of any Incentive Stock Option that is otherwise exercisable during the post-termination period specified under Section 5(g), (h) or (i), applied without regard to the $100,000 limitation contained in Section 422(d) of the Code, is greater than the portion of such Option that is immediately exercisable as an "Incentive Stock Option" during such post-termination period under Section 422, such excess shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option; and
 
(ii) if the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option is accelerated by reason of a Change in Control, any portion of such Option that is not exercisable as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of the $100,000 limitation contained in Section 422(d) of the Code shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
(l) 
Settlement Provisions.
  If the option agreement so provides at grant or (except in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) is amended after grant and prior to exercise to so provide (with the optionee's consent), the Committee may require that all or part of the shares to be issued with respect to the spread value of an exercised Option take the form of Restricted Stock, which shall be valued on the date of exercise on the basis of the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Committee) of such Restricted Stock.
 
(m) 
Performance and Other Conditions.
  The Committee may condition the grant, vesting or exercise of any Option upon the attainment of specified performance goals or other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion. The Committee in its discretion may also provide in the option agreement that any such conditional Option shall vest immediately prior to its expiration if the conditions to exercise have not theretofore been satisfied.
 
 
 
 
SECTION
 6.  
Stock Appreciation Rights.
 
(a) 
Grant and Exercise.
  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted on such terms as shall be consistent with the Plan. A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by an optionee, subject to Section 6(b), in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for such purpose. Upon such exercise, the optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner prescribed in Section 6(b).
 
(b) 
Terms and Conditions.
  Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee, including the following:
 
(i) SARs shall be exercisable only at such time or times during such periods and for such number of SARs as shall be determined by the Committee, provided that no SAR may be exercised more than 10 years after the date of grant, and any SAR may be subject to earlier termination, cancellation or expiration as provided in the Plan.
 
(ii) Upon the exercise of a SAR, an optionee shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash and/or shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of grant, or such other price per share as the Committee shall determine, multiplied by the number of SARs which shall have been exercised, with the Committee having the right to determine the form of payment at or after grant. SARs exercised and settled in shares of Common Stock shall be counted in full amount exercised against the number of shares available for grant under the 2004 Plan, regardless of the number of net shares issued upon settlement of the SAR.
 
(iii) Stock Appreciation Rights shall be transferable only to the extent that Stock Options would be transferable under Section 5(e) of the Plan.
 
(iv) The Committee may condition the grant, vesting or exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right upon the attainment of specified performance goals or other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.
 
SECTION
 7.  
Restricted Stock.
 
(a) 
Administration.
  Shares of Restricted Stock may be issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside the Plan. The Committee shall determine the eligible persons to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock will be made, the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be awarded to any person, the price (if any) to be paid by the recipient of Restricted Stock (subject to Section 7(b)), the time or times within which such awards may be subject to forfeiture, and the other terms, restrictions and conditions of the awards in addition to those set forth in Section 7(c). The Committee may condition the grant of Restricted Stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals or such other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion. The provisions of Restricted Stock awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
(b) 
Awards and Certificates.
  The prospective recipient of a Restricted Stock award shall not have any rights with respect to such award, unless and until such recipient has executed an agreement evidencing the award and has delivered a fully executed copy thereof to the Company, and has otherwise complied with the applicable terms and conditions of such award.
 
(i) The purchase price for shares of Restricted Stock shall be established by the Committee and may be zero.
 
(ii) Awards of Restricted Stock must be accepted within a period of 60 days (or such shorter period as the Committee may specify at grant) after the award date, by executing a Restricted Stock Award Agreement and paying whatever price (if any) is required under Section 7(b)(i).
 
 
 
 
(iii) Each participant receiving a Restricted Stock award shall be issued either a stock certificate in respect of such shares of Restricted Stock or such shares may be held in an uncertificated book account by the Company's transfer agent. Shares shall be registered in the name of such participant, and, in the case of a stock certificate, such certificate shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such award.
 
(iv) The Committee shall require that the stock certificates or book entry accounts evidencing such shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock award, the participant shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the shares of Common Stock covered by such award.
 
(c) 
Restrictions and Conditions.
  The shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
 
(i) In accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the award agreement, during a period set by the Committee commencing with the date of such award (the "Restriction Period"), the participant shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise encumber shares of Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan. Within these limits, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for the lapse of such restrictions in installments and may accelerate or waive such restrictions, in whole or in part, based on service, performance, or such other factors or criteria as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion.
 
(ii) Except as provided in this paragraph (ii) and Section 7(c)(i), the participant shall have, with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock, all of the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares, and the right to receive any cash dividends. The Committee, in its sole discretion, as determined at the time of award, may permit or require the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and, if the Committee so determines, reinvested, subject to Section 15(e), in additional Restricted Stock to the extent shares are available under Section 3, or otherwise reinvested. Pursuant to Section 3 above, stock dividends issued with respect to Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of Restricted Stock that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions that apply to the shares with respect to which such dividends are issued. If the Committee so determines, the award agreement may also impose restrictions on the right to vote and the right to receive dividends.
 
(iii) Subject to the applicable provisions of the award agreement and this Section 7, upon termination of a participant's employment with the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate for any reason other than death or Disability during the Restriction Period, all shares still subject to restriction will vest, or be forfeited, in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Committee at or after grant.
 
(iv) Upon termination of a participant's employment with the Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate by reason of death or Disability during the Restriction Period, all shares still subject to restriction will fully vest, the restrictions shall lapse and the unrestricted shares shall be delivered promptly to the participant or to the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the participant under the will of the participant.
 
(v) If and when the Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture of the Restricted Stock subject to such Restriction Period, certificates for an appropriate number of unrestricted shares shall be delivered to the participant promptly.
 
(d) 
Minimum Value Provisions.
  In order to better ensure that award payments actually reflect the performance of the Company and service of the participant, the Committee may provide, in its sole discretion, for a tandem performance-based or other award designed to guarantee a minimum value, payable in cash or Common Stock to the recipient of a restricted stock award, subject to such performance, future service, deferral, and other terms and conditions as may be specified by the Committee.

8.3 
Payment of Performance Awards.
  Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the performance period or, in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee, on a deferred basis. Termination of employment prior to the end of any performance period, other than for reasons of death or Disability, will result in the forfeiture of the Performance Award for that period, and no payments will be made with respect to that period, except that the Committee at grant may provide that certain awards that are performance based, paid in cash, and designed primarily for retention of key executives may be paid upon termination by the Company other than for cause.

Awards to Outside Directors.
 
(a) 
Applicability and Administration.
  The provisions of this Section 11 shall apply only to awards to Outside Directors in accordance with this Section 11. The Committee shall have no authority to determine the timing of or the terms or conditions of any award under this Section 11. Instead, the Board shall have the authority to interpret its provisions and supervise its administration, subject to the provisions provided herein. All decisions made by the Board under this Section 11 shall be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members then in office.
 
(b)

Compensation allocated to cash is paid out quarterly in arrears. Compensation allocated to deferred cash is credited quarterly with interest based on the Company's borrowing rate set at the beginning of each year. Compensation allocated to stock awards (Stock Options, Restricted Stock or deferred Stock Units) will be converted to awards of equivalent value determined by using the same method used to expense the awards for financial accounting purposes. The exercise price of each Outside Director Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 11(b) shall equal the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on such option's date of grant. No Outside Director Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 11 shall qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.
 
(ii) Upon joining the Board, new Outside Directors would receive a one-time initial grant of a non-qualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock vesting in equal increments over four years. Compensation for directors elected after January 1st will be prorated.

  Outside Director Stock Options vest in equal quarterly increments over the year compensation is payable. Outside Director Stock Options may be exercised, in whole or in part, only by notice in writing to the Company (i) stating the number of shares as to which such option is to be exercised and the address to which the certificates for such shares are to be sent, accompanied by cash, certified check or bank draft payable to the order of the Company, in an amount equal to such option's exercise price per share multiplied by the number of shares of the Common Stock as to which such option is then being exercised or (ii) instructing the Company to deliver the shares being purchased to a broker, subject to the broker's delivery of cash to the Company equal to such option purchase price per share multiplied by the number of shares as to which such Outside Director Stock Option is then being exercised, or (iii) delivering shares of Common Stock already owned by the Outside Director as partial or full payment of the Outside Director Stock Option in accordance with the terms and restrictions set forth under Section 5(d).

Distribution of Stock Units.
  Outside Director Stock Units vest in equal quarterly increments over the year compensation is payable. Stock Units will not be evidenced by or convertible into any actual shares of the Company's common stock until distribution. Vested Stock Units will not be distributed until an Outside Director's termination from service on the Board, or upon his or her death or upon a change in control (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended).

Termination.
  The termination of Outside Director Stock Options or Outside Director Restricted Stock shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 5(g), 5(i) and 5(j) hereof as if Outside Directors were employees of the Company, except that any determination to accelerate the vesting of an Outside Director Stock Option or Outside Director Restricted Stock will be made by the Board and not by the Committee. Non-vested Stock Units shall be forfeited upon termination of an Outside Director, except in the case of termination by reason of death, which shall be governed by the provisions of Section 5(g) hereof as if the Outside Director were an employee of the Company.

Certain Changes.

Change in Control Provisions.
 
(a) 
Impact of Event.
  The Committee may determine, at or after grant (subject to any right of approval expressly reserved by the Committee or the Board at the time of such determination), that in the event of a "Change in Control" as defined in Section 12(b), the following acceleration provisions shall apply:
 
(i) any Stock Appreciation Rights, any Stock Option or Outside Director Stock Option awarded under the Plan not previously exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable and vested.
 
(ii) the restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock, Outside Director Restricted Stock, Performance Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards, in each case to the extent not already vested under the Plan, shall lapse and such shares and awards shall be deemed fully vested.
 
(iii) the Board or the Committee may impose additional conditions on the acceleration or valuation of any award in the award agreement.
 
(b) 
Definition of Change in Control.
  For purposes of Section 12(a), a "Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:
 
(i) any person or entity, including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, other than the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary thereof or any employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner of the Company's securities having 35% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company that may be cast for the election of directors of the Company (other than as a result of an issuance of securities initiated by the Company in the ordinary course of business or other than transactions which are approved by a majority of the Board); or
 
(ii) as the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sales of assets or contested election, or any combination of the foregoing transactions, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company or any successor corporation or entity entitled to vote generally in the election of the directors of the Company or such other corporation or entity after such transactions are held in the aggregate by the holders of the Company's securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such transaction; or
 
 
 
 
(iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, of each director of the Company first elected during such period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of the Company then still in office who were directors of the Company at the beginning of any such period.

Amendments and Termination.
 
The Board may at any time amend, alter or discontinue the Plan; provided, however, that, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, no amendment or alteration may be made which would (a) except as a result of the provisions of Section 3(d) of the Plan, increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan or increase the Section 162(m) Maximum, (b) change the provisions governing Incentive Stock Options except as required or permitted under the provisions governing incentive stock options under the Code, or (c) make any change for which applicable law or regulatory authority (including the regulatory authority of the New York Stock Exchange or any other market or exchange on which the Common Stock is traded) would require shareholder approval or for which shareholder approval would be required to secure full deductibility of compensation received under the Plan under Section 162(m) of the Code. No amendment, alteration, or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of an optionee or participant under a Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock, Performance Award, Other Stock-Based Award, Outside Director Stock Option or Outside Director Restricted Stock theretofore granted, without the participant's consent.
 
The Committee may amend the terms of any Stock Option or other award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Section 3 above, no such amendment shall impair the rights of any holder without the holder's consent. The Committee may also substitute new Stock Options for previously granted Stock Options (on a one for one or other basis); provided, however, the Committee may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, modify any outstanding Stock Option so as to specify a lower exercise price or accept the surrender of an outstanding Stock Option and authorize the granting of a new Stock Option in substitution therefor specifying a lower exercise price. Solely for purposes of computing the Section 162(m) Maximum, if any Stock Options or other awards previously granted to a participant are canceled and new Stock Options or other awards having a lower exercise price or other more favorable terms for the participant are substituted in their place, both the initial Stock Options or other awards and the replacement Stock Options or other awards will be deemed to be outstanding (although the canceled Stock Options or other awards will not be exercisable or deemed outstanding for any other purposes).

Unfunded Status of Plan.
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a participant or optionee by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such participant or optionee any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or payments in lieu of or with respect to awards hereunder; provided, however, that, unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of the affected participant, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.

.
  
General Provisions.
 
(a) The Committee may require each person purchasing shares pursuant to a Stock Option or other award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the optionee or participant is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer. All certificates for shares of Common Stock or other securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable Federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
(b) Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(c) The adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate any right to continued employment with the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate the employment of any of its employees at any time.
 
(d) No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the participant for Federal income tax purposes with respect to any award under the Plan, the participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding the payment of, any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. The Committee may require withholding obligations to be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of the award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements and the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the participant.
 
(e) The actual or deemed reinvestment of dividends or dividend equivalents in additional Restricted Stock (or other types of Plan awards) at the time of any dividend payment shall only be permissible if sufficient shares of Common Stock are available under Section 3 for such reinvestment (taking into account then outstanding Stock Options and other Plan awards).
 
(f) The Plan and all awards made and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(g) The members of the Committee and the Board shall not be liable to any employee or other person with respect to any determination made hereunder in a manner that is not inconsistent with their legal obligations as members of the Board. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as directors or as members of the Committee, the members of the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any option granted thereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such Committee member is liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duties; provided that within 60 days after institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, the Committee member shall in writing offer the Company the opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same.
 
 
 
 
(h) In addition to any other restrictions on transfer that may be applicable under the terms of this Plan or the applicable award agreement, no Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock award, Performance Award, Other Stock-Based Award, Outside Director Stock Option, Outside Director Restricted Stock or other right issued under this Plan is transferable by the participant without the prior written consent of the Committee, or, in the case of an Outside Director, the Board, other than (i) transfers by an optionee to a member of his or her Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of the optionee or a member of his or her Immediate Family or (ii) transfers by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The designation of a beneficiary will not constitute a transfer.
 
(i) The Committee may, at or after grant, condition the receipt of any payment in respect of any award or the transfer of any shares subject to an award on the satisfaction of a six-month holding period, if such holding period is required for compliance with Section 16 under the Exchange Act.
