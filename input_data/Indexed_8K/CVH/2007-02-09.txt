Revises 2007 Diluted EPS Guidance Range to $3.85 to $3.95
 
Bethesda, Maryland (February 9, 2007)  Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Operating revenues totaled $1.94 billion for the quarter with net earnings of $156.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total revenues were $7.73 billion with net earnings of $560.0 million, or $3.47 per diluted share.
 
"I am pleased to report another strong quarter of financial results to complete 2006," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "During the year, our health plans continued to perform at a high level, our Medicare business has expanded meaningfully and we successfully completed the integration of First Health. We have realigned our Company with a focus on positioning our well-diversified businesses for continued growth and new opportunities in 2007 and beyond."
 
Additionally, on February 8 Coventry announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Concentra's workers' compensation managed care services businesses for $387.5 million in an all-cash transaction. As this transaction is not expected to close for 90 to 180 days, the financial impact has been excluded from all 2007 guidance elements.
