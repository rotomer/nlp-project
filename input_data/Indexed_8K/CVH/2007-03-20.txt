The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
     (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
     (h) The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show.

Notice to Holders; Waiver.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) to Holders of Securities if in writing and mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.
     In any case where notice to Holders of Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities given as provided herein. Any notice mailed in the manner prescribed by this Indenture shall be conclusively deemed to have been given whether or not received by any particular Holder. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the reasonable approval of the Trustee for such Securities shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee for such Securities, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

     Unless otherwise provided with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 301, any Securities of a series other than Securities issued in global form (which may be of any
 
denomination) shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Section 303.
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
     The Securities and any related coupons shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, or its President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
     Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, executed by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and such Trustee, in accordance with the Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent Global Security. If all the Securities of any one series are not to be issued at one time and if a Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate relating to such Securities shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities, including, without limitation, procedures with respect to interest rate, Stated Maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue.
     If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, and Opinion of Counsel stating,
     (1) If the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
     (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own
 
rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
     Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to Sections 102 and 301 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
     Except as specified pursuant to Section 301, each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein manually executed by the Trustee for such Security or on its behalf pursuant to Section 614, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such Trustee, or any successor Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.
     Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301 for a Global Security in registered form must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and any other applicable statute or regulation.
     The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
Section 304.
Temporary Securities and Exchange of Securities.
     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any particular series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall authenticate and deliver, in the manner specified in Section 303, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, photocopied or otherwise produced, in any denomination, with like terms and conditions as the definitive Securities of like series in lieu of which they are issued in registered form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Any such temporary Securities may be in global form, representing such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
     Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged only in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs or as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or a Supplemental Indenture), if temporary Securities of any particular series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of such definitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities of a like Stated Maturity and with like
 
terms and provisions upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series, together with all unmatured coupons and matured coupons in default, if any, at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any particular series, the Company shall execute and (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first definitive Security of such series) the Trustee for the Securities of such series or the Global Exchange Agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of authorized denominations of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions. Until exchanged as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and with like terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     Any temporary Global Security and any permanent Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to a Depositary designated pursuant to Section 301.
Section 305.
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee for the Securities of each series a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee for the Securities of each series is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities of such series as herein provided.
     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any particular series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for the Securities of each series shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions.
     Except as set forth below, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any particular series may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 304, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     If at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series in registered form notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 303, the
 
Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities for such series. If (i) a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee for Securities of such series in registered form a Company Order stating that the Securities of such series shall be exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default under Section 501 hereof has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of such series, the Company's election pursuant to Section 301 shall no longer be effective with respect to the Securities for such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities in registered form, the Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series of like tenor and terms and in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
     Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive form representing the aggregate principal amount of such Global Security, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee for such Security) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such series duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
 
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1104 and ending at the close of business on, if Securities of the series are issuable only as Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption as a whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
     Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 305, the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities if, as a result of the exchange, the Company would suffer adverse consequences under any United States law or regulation.
Section 306.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities and Coupons.
     If (i) any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee for such Security or the Company and the Trustee for a Security receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon and (ii) there is delivered to the Company and such Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or such Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide or protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request such Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for such mutilated Security, or in exchange for the Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen) a new Security of the same series and in a like principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security or coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and such Trustee and any agent of any of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including all fees and expenses of the Trustee for such Security) connected therewith.
     Every new Security of any series, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for any mutilated Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and each such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder.
 
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
Section 307.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, if so provided in such Security, be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment in respect of Securities of such series, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of the principal of a Security shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series that is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in the Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 201 with respect to the related series of Securities.
     Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company in the case of Securities, may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series in definitive form, whether having identical or different terms and provisions, having the same Interest Payment Dates will, at the option of the Company, be entitled to receive interest payments, other than at Maturity, by wire transfer of immediately available funds if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee for the Securities of such series at least 15 days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. Any wire instructions received by the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall remain in effect until revoked by the Holder.
     Any interest on any Security of any particular series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee for the Securities of such series in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of that series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with such Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series), equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to such Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon such Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by such Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. Such Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
 
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and shall be acceptable to the Trustee, and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of that series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of that series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities of any particular series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of the series in respect of which interest is in default, may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice is given by the Company to the Trustee for the Securities of such series of the proposed manner of payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by such Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 308.
Persons Deemed Owners.
     Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee for such Security and any agent of the Company or such Trustee shall treat the Person in whose name any such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, such Trustee or any agent of the Company or such Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 309.
Cancellation.
     All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or delivered in satisfaction of any sinking fund payment, shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee for such Securities, be delivered to such Trustee and, in the case of Securities, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for Securities of a series for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by such Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, in the case of a series, all the Securities of which are not to be originally issued at one time, a Security of such series shall not be deemed to have been Outstanding at any time hereunder if and to the extent that, subsequent to the authentication and delivery thereof, such Security is delivered to the Trustee for such Security for cancellation by the Company or any agent thereof upon the failure of the original purchaser thereof to make payment therefor against delivery thereof, and any Security so delivered to such Trustee shall be promptly cancelled by it. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All
 
cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee for such Securities shall be disposed of by such Trustee in accordance with its standard procedures and a certificate of disposition evidencing such disposition of Securities and coupons shall be provided to the Company by such Trustee provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be required to destroy such cancelled Securities. Permanent Global Securities shall not be disposed of until exchanged in full for definitive Securities or until payment thereon is made in full.
Section 310.
Computation of Interest.
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any particular series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
     The Company may, at its option evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate, at any time, with respect to the Securities of any series, elect to have either Section 402 and/or 403 be applied to all of the Outstanding Securities of that series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Four.
Section 402.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 402, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities of the particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth below in Section 404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the obligations relating to the Outstanding Securities of that series and the Securities of that series, including any coupons appertaining thereto, shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 406, Section 408 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 402, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on written demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities of the particular series and coupons, if any, of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities when
 
such payments are due or on the Redemption Date solely out of the trust created pursuant to this Indenture; (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities concerning issuing temporary Securities of that series, or, where relevant, registration of such Securities, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of that series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for Securities payments held in trust; (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee for the Securities of that series, and the Company's obligations in connection therewith and with respect to the Company's obligations to the Trustee under Section 607; and (d) this Article Four and the obligations set forth in Section 406 hereof.
     Subject to compliance with this Article Four, the Company may exercise its option under Section 402 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 403 with respect to the Securities of a particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto. Following such defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
Section 403.
Covenant Defeasance.
     Upon the Company's exercise under Section 401 of the option applicable to this Section 403, the Company shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 801, 1004 and 1007 hereof (and any other covenant in addition to those set forth herein applicable to Securities of any series pursuant to Section 301 hereof specified to be released as provided under this Section 403) with respect to the Outstanding Securities of the particular series, along with any additional covenants contained in such Security or any supplemental Indenture in connection therewith, on and after the date the conditions set forth below in Section 404 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant defeasance"), and the Securities of that series shall thereafter be deemed not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of that series appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or Event of Default under subsection 501(3) but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be unaffected thereby.
Section 404.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 503.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if:
     (1) default is made in the payment of any interest upon any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days; or
     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security of any series at its Maturity;
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee for the Securities of such series, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium if any) and interest, if any, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by such Securities; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, such Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding against the Company for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any particular series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 504.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relating to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of any series or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee for the Securities of such series (irrespective of whether the principal of any Security of such series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise
 
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of such series and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of such Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607) and of the Holders of the Securities of such series allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
     (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities to make such payments to such Trustee, and in the event that such Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities, to pay to such Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee for the Securities of any series to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee for the Securities of any series to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other person performing similar functions.

     Subject to Section 508, no Holder of any Security of any particular series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
     (1) an Event of Default with respect to that series shall have occurred and be continuing and such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee for the Securities of such series (other than with respect to an Event of Default referred to in Sections 501(4) and (5)) of such default and the continuance thereof;
     (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee for the Securities of such series to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
     (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to such Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
     (4) such Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to such Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Securities of that series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities of that series, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders of Securities of that series.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security of any series shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
Section 509.
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee for the Securities of any series or any Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, such Trustee and the Holders of Securities shall,
 
subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Trustee and such Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 510.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee for the Securities of any series or to the Holders of Securities is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 511.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     No delay or omission of the Trustee for the Securities of any series or of any Holder of any Security of such series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to such Trustee for the Securities of any series or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Section 512.
Control by Holders.

     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability;
     (2) such Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by such Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction; and
     (3) subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders not joining in any such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability.

     (1) a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of that series; or
     (2) a default with respect to a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of that series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 514.
Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for the Securities of any series for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee for the Securities of any series, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
Section 515.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee for any series of Securities, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

     (2) such Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

     (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee for any series of Securities shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 602.

     (2) such Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
 
     (3) such Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of such Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

If no successor Trustee for the Securities of such series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and shall have accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, and if such Trustee to be replaced is still incapable of acting, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, or the retiring Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
     (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 106.

In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent for such series then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee or Authenticating Agent, as the case may be, may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee or successor Authenticating Agent had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 614.
Authenticating Agents.
     At any time when any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may, subject to its sole discretion, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with respect to the Securities of such series, which may include the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, with power to act on the Trustee's behalf and subject to its discretion in the authentication and
 
delivery of Securities of such series in connection with transfers and exchanges under Sections 304, 305 and 1107 as fully to all intents and purposes as though such Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections of this Indenture to authenticate and deliver Securities of such series. For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Securities of such series by an Authenticating Agent for such Securities pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of such Securities "by the Trustee" for the Securities of such series. Any such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually pursuant to law or the requirements of such supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or the Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.
     Any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company in the manner set forth in Section 105. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities shall cease to be eligible under this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company and shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series of Securities is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certification of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
 
     "This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein described in the within-mentioned Indenture.

The Trustee for each series of Securities may destroy any list relating to such series of Securities furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list relating to such series so furnished.

     (ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Securities of that series whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application.
     If any such Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to that information, such Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each Holder of Securities of that series whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by such Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to such Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, such Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of such Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Securities of that series or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, such Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise such Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
     (c) Every Holder of Securities of each series, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee for the Securities of such series that neither the Company nor such Trustee, nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section 702(b).

     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2007 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice setting forth the procedures governing such Change of Control Offer as required by the Indenture.

     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification or waiver of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past Defaults (other than with respect to nonpayment or in respect of a provision that cannot be amended without the written consent of each Holder affected) under the Indenture and their consequences.

The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the preceding March 1, in the case of an Interest Payment Date of March 15, and the preceding September 1, in the case of an Interest Payment Date of September 15 (whether or not, in each case, a Business Day), even if Securities are cancelled, repurchased or redeemed after the Regular Record Date and on or before the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
     Payments in respect of Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by the transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or any successor depository.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
     In Witness Whereof, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
Dated: March 20, 2007
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2007 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
     The Securities are subject to redemption prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at any time, as a whole or from time to time, in part, at the election of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the Securities to be redeemed consisting of principal and interest, exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield plus 25 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; provided interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.
     Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Securities will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities pursuant to a Change of Control Offer described in the Indenture at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to the Change of Control Payment Date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice setting forth the procedures governing such Change of Control Offer as required by the Indenture.
     In the event of redemption or repurchase of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification or waiver of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past Defaults (other than with respect to nonpayment or in respect of a provision that cannot be amended without the written consent of each Holder affected) under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder
 
and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee satisfactory indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
