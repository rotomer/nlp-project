Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On July 11, 2007, Coventry Health Care, Inc. (the "Company") executed an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with the lenders named therein, as Initial Lenders, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as Co-Documentation Agents, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $850,000,000, with the Company having the ability to request an increase in the facility amount up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1,000,000,000. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company.
     Advances under the Credit Agreement bear interest (1) a rate per annum equal to the Administrative Agent's base rate (the "Base Rate") or (2) the one-, two-, three-, six-, nine-, or twelve-month rate per annum for Eurodollar deposits (the "Eurodollar Rate") plus an applicable margin, as selected by the Company. The applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate advances depends on the Company's debt ratings and varies from 0.350% to 1.000%.
     The credit facility provides for a $100,000,000 subfacility for letters of credit. Letter of credit fees are payable in respect of outstanding letters of credit at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for Eurodollar Rate advances.
     Commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit facility are payable at rates per annum ranging from 0.080% to 0.200%, depending on the Company's debt ratings.
     The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to: create or permit liens on assets, make accounting changes other than as required or permitted by generally accepted accounting principles, dispose of substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company or enter into new unrelated lines of business. The Credit Agreement also includes covenants that restrict the ability of the Company to engage in mergers or consolidations where the Company is not the surviving corporation and that restrict the ability of the Company's subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and guarantee obligations. The Credit Agreement also requires compliance with a maximum leverage ratio test.
     If an event of default under the credit facility shall occur and be continuing, the commitments under the credit facility may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding under the credit facility, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing under the Credit Agreement and related loan documents, may be declared immediately due and payable.
     The Company will use the net proceeds of the borrowings under the credit facility to refinance the Company's previously existing credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
     The description of the Credit Agreement set forth in this Form 8-K is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
     Item 1.01 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 to the extent it describes the creation of a direct financial obligation.

If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; , , that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term "Taxes" shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; , , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each

This opinion letter is provided to you at the request of the Company pursuant to subsection 3.01(f)(iv) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the same meanings as in the Credit Agreement.
Company
Credit Agreement
          We have examined the Credit Agreement and the Notes executed and delivered by the Company on the date hereof (collectively the ""; hereinafter, "" shall mean and refer to the Notes executed and delivered by the Company on the date hereof). We have also reviewed such corporate records of the Company, such certificates of public officials and such other matters regarding the Company as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion letter. As to factual matters, we have assumed the correctness of and relied upon statements and other representations of the Company and the officers thereof set forth in the Credit Agreement and in certificates provided pursuant to or in connection with the Credit Agreement or otherwise provided to us, and upon certificates of public officials, and we have made no independent inquiries or investigations. For purposes of the opinions on the existence and good standing of the Company, we have relied solely upon a certificate of existence from the Delaware Secretary of State dated July ___, 2007.
Loan Documents
Notes
          In making such examination and in expressing our opinions, we have assumed, without investigation or inquiry:
     (a) the due organization and existence of all parties to the Loan Documents, except to the extent that we express an opinion in Paragraph 1 below regarding the incorporation and existence of the Company,
     (b) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by all parties thereto other than the Company,
     (c) that all parties to the Loan Documents have the legal right, power and authority to enter into the Loan Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, except to the extent that we express an opinion in Paragraph 1 below regarding the corporate power and corporate authority of the Company, and
 
     (d) that all signatures on any executed documents furnished to us are genuine, all original documents submitted to us are authentic originals and all certified or other reproductions of documents submitted to us conform to the original documents.
          Based upon the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications herein set forth, we are of the opinion that:
          1. The Company is a duly incorporated and validly existing Delaware corporation, in good standing under the laws of Delaware. The Company has the necessary corporate power and corporate authority to execute and deliver the Credit Agreement and the Notes and to enter into and perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the performance and observance of the provisions thereof have been properly authorized by all necessary corporate actions on the part of the Company.
          2. The Credit Agreement has been properly executed by the Company and, as executed and delivered, is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. The Notes have been properly executed by the Company and, as executed and delivered, are valid and binding obligations of the Company and are enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.
          3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, the consummation of the financing transaction that is the subject thereof and the borrowings by the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement (a) will not violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) are not prohibited by, and will not subject the Company, the Agent or any Lender to any fine, penalty or similar sanction under, any federal, Tennessee or Delaware statute or regulation (including but not limited to Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or, to our knowledge, any order of any court, arbitrator or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company, and (c) will not constitute a breach of or a default under, or result in the imposition of a Lien on any properties of the Company under, any of the Indentures identified on hereto. Please note, however, that the incurrence of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and the Notes in excess of the unused amounts permitted by Subsections 4.08(2)(b), (k) and (m) of the 2005 Indentures would require compliance with Subsection 4.08(1) of the 2005 Indentures.
Annex 1
          4. No authorization, consent, approval or other action by or filing with any federal, Tennessee or Delaware governmental authority is required for the execution and delivery by the Company of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, the consummation of the financing transaction that is the subject thereof, borrowings by the Company thereunder or the performance by the Company of its payment obligations thereunder.
          We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the choice of law provisions contained in the Credit Agreement under the laws of New York or Tennessee, nor, assuming such provisions would be enforceable under the choice-of-law principles of New York and Tennessee, do we state any opinion as to the enforceability of the Credit Agreement or the Notes under the internal laws of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you have requested us to examine the Credit Agreement and the Notes and provide you with the opinions set forth herein assuming, solely for purposes of such opinions, that the internal laws of Tennessee would govern
 
them. If the Credit Agreement and the Notes were to be governed by the internal laws of Tennessee, our opinions would be as set forth herein. We note that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines one or more of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be unenforceable under the laws of New York, then such document(s) may not be enforced by Tennessee courts under applicable Tennessee conflict of law principles.
          The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of Tennessee, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States of America.
          The opinions expressed herein are qualified as follows:
     (a) The validity, binding nature and enforceability of any liability, obligation, instrument, document or agreement are subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer and similar federal and state laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, and (ii) general principles of equity, whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity, which may, among other things, limit the ability of the Agent or the Lenders to accelerate the maturity of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Notes on the basis of an immaterial breach of a provision of the Loan Documents, or limit the availability of equitable remedies (including but not limited to the remedy of specific performance).
     (b) We express no opinion with respect to the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law.
     (c) We express no opinion with respect to the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents imposing penalties or forfeitures.
     (d) We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any provision of any of the Loan Documents to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations.
     (e) We express no opinion with respect to the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
     (f) We express no opinion with respect to compliance or the effects of noncompliance with laws governing usury, interest or loan charges.
     (g) We express no opinion as to the authorization of (i) any Commitment Increase, (ii) any instrument or agreement between or among the Company, the Agent and any of the Lenders to effectuate a Commitment Increase or (iii) any Borrowing or
 
other extension of credit under the Credit Agreement that requires utilization of a Commitment Increase.
     (h) We express no opinion with respect to compliance or the effects of noncompliance with financial covenants or ratios or with respect to any other matter that would require us to perform a mathematical calculation or to make a financial or accounting determination.
          Our opinion is rendered as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you of changes in law or fact (or the effect thereof on the opinions expressed herein) that hereafter may come to our attention.
          As used herein, "knowledge", "known to us", "to our knowledge" and any similar expression refer solely to the current, actual knowledge, acquired during the course of our representation of the Company, of those attorneys in this firm who have rendered legal services in connection with such representation.
