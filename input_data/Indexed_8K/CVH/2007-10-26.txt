_____________________________________
 
Announces 2008 Guidance
 
Bethesda, Maryland (October 26, 2007)  Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. Operating revenues totaled $2.52 billion for the quarter with net earnings of $168.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
 
The Company is expecting diluted earnings per share of $1.17 to $1.18 for the fourth quarter, resulting in a 2007 full year diluted GAAP earnings per share range of $3.97 to $3.98, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. Additionally, the Company is projecting 2008 full year diluted GAAP earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.58, an increase of 11% to 15% over 2007 expectations.
 
I am pleased to present another quarter of impressive top and bottom line growth from our well-diversified portfolio of businesses, said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. Seeking and seizing organic and acquisition opportunities should enable Coventry to grow operating revenue by more than 25% in 2007 and approaching 30% in 2008. This positions us well for another year of steady and reliable earnings growth in 2008.
