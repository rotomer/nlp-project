Other Offices.
     2.1 All meetings of the shareholders for any purpose shall be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. If no place is fixed by the Board of Directors, the meeting shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation.
Place of Meetings.
     2.2 Annual meetings of the shareholders shall be held on the third Thursday of May of each year (unless such day shall fall on a legal holiday), in which event such meeting shall be held on the next full business day following such legal holiday) or at such time as shall be designated by the Chairman of the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of such meeting. At each such annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect a Board of Directors and transact such other business as properly may be brought before the meeting.

Action by Shareholders.
     2.7 Each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of stock entitled to vote held by such shareholder. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater or lesser number is required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the Bylaws, and except that in elections of directors those receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not receiving a majority.
Voting.
     Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. If a quorum of a voting group shall not be present or represented at any meeting, the shares entitled to vote thereat shall have power to adjourn the meeting to a different date, time or place without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the new date, time or place to which the meeting is adjourned. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum of any voting group shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted by such voting group which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
     (a)  A shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment either personally or by his or her attorney-in-fact. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for three (3) years unless another period is expressly provided in the appointment form. An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.
Proxies.
     2.8 No defect in the calling or noticing of a shareholders' meeting will affect the validity of any action at the meeting if a quorum was present, and if each shareholder not present in person or by proxy signs a written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes, either before or after the meeting, such waivers, consents, or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

Such list shall be kept open at the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder.
     2.11 The order of business of each meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the dismissal of business not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meetings after the time prescribed for commencement thereof, and opening and closing of the voting polls.
Order of Business.
     2.12 At an annual or special meeting of the shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at such annual or special meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. For business to be properly brought before an annual or special meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 130 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to the shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual or special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made; provided, further, that in the case of the annual meeting of shareholders, notice by a shareholder must be received at least 120 days in advance of the anniversary of the date the corporation's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders, unless no such annual meeting was held during the prior year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 calendar days. Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual or special meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual or special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual or special meeting; (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such shareholder; (c) the class and number of each class or series of the shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder; and (d) any material interest of such shareholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual or special meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. The chairman of an annual or special meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in
Notice of Shareholder Business.
 
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

     (a) . Action required or permitted by statute to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if a written consent, delivered to the Corporation, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Action Without a Meeting
     2.13 Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a meeting of shareholders (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.13. Nominations by shareholders shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 130 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to the shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual or special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made; provided, further, that in the case of the annual meeting of shareholders, notice by a shareholder must be received at least 120 days in advance of the anniversary of the date the corporation's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders, unless no such annual meeting was held during the prior year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 calendar days. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such shareholder and (ii) the , and of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder.

Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     2.14 Meetings of the shareholders shall be presided over by the Chief Executive Officer, or if the Chief Executive Officer is not present, by the President, or if the Chief Executive Officer and the President are not present, by a chairman chosen by a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting.

Presiding Officer and Secretary.
     3.1 The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors, which may exercise all powers of the Corporation and do all lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the shareholders. The Board of Directors shall constitute the governing body of the Corporation and shall be responsible to the shareholders for setting policy, long range planning and providing oversight of the management of the Corporation.
Powers of Directors.
     3.2 The number of directors, which shall constitute the Board of Directors, shall be not less than three directors and may increase to such other number of Directors as shall be determined, from time to time, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Each class of directors shall be as nearly equal in number of directors as possible and shall be denominated in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine. The term of office of those of Class I will expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders following their election; of Class II one year thereafter; of Class III two years thereafter; and at each annual election held after such classification and election, the successors to the class of directors whose terms shall expire that year shall be elected to hold office for a term of three (3) years, so that the term of office for one class of directors shall expire in each year. Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Delaware.
Election and Term.
 
     3.4 Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of death, resignation, or removal shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors entitled to vote although the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election at a regular meeting or a special meeting of the Board of Directors called for that purpose, or at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose.
Filling Vacancies.
     3.5 Any director may resign from office at any time by delivering a written resignation to the Secretary, and such resignation shall be effective immediately upon delivery to the Secretary.
Resignation of Directors.
     3.6 Any director may be removed from the Board of Directors at any time for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to be cast for the election of directors; provided, however, a director may be removed "for cause" only upon a finding that (i) the director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the Corporation, and (ii) removal is in the best interests of the Corporation. Directors of the Corporation may be removed for any reason other than cause only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.

Chairman of the Board.
     3.9 Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.

     3.11 At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority
Quorum of Directors.
 
of the directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
     3.12 The Board of Directors by resolution passed by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, may from time to time designate members of the Board of Directors to constitute committees, including an executive committee, a finance committee, compensation committee, audit and nominating committee, which shall in each case consist of not less than three (3) directors and have and may exercise such powers as the Board of Directors may determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them. A majority of all the members of any such committee may determine its action and fix the time and place of any meeting, unless the Board of Directors shall otherwise direct. The Board of Directors shall have power at any time to change the number and the members of any such committee, to fill vacancies and to discharge any such committee but shall not execute this power in violation of the provisions of any agreement between the Corporation and any of its shareholders.
Committees.
     3.13 Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by all the members of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be.
Action by Written Consent.
     3.14 By resolution of the Board of Directors, the directors may be paid their expenses, if any, for attending each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attending each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary for serving as a director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefore. Members of the executive committee or of special or standing committees may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Compensation of Directors.
     3.15. The Board of Directors shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and such minutes shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation. Committees of the Board of Directors shall maintain a separate record of the minutes of their proceedings.

Method of Giving Notice.
 
     4.2. Any notice required to be given may be subject to a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to receive such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, and such waiver shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice in a timely manner. Any such signed waiver of notice, or a signed copy thereof, shall be placed in the minute book of the Corporation. Attendance of such persons at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meetings, except where there persons attend for the express purpose of objecting that the meeting is not lawfully convened.
Waiver of Notice.
     4.3. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the Board of Directors, unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors. A director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to such action unless:

The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.
     4.4. Subject to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") or these bylaws for notice, shareholders, members of the Board of Directors, or members of any committee designated by such Board of Directors, may participate in and hold a meeting of such shareholders, Board of Directors, or committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 4.4 of Article 4 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Compensation of Officers.

     5.4. An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the Corporation. Such resignation is effective when such notice is delivered unless such notice specifies a later effective date.

Removal of Officers.

members of advisory boards of health care organizations and other facilities owned by the Corporation and physicians serving on medical staff committees of such health care organizations) of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or not taken by such person while acting in any such capacity, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (whether with or without court approval) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
     8.2. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is or was threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including without limitation members of advisory boards of hospitals and other facilities owned by the Corporation and physicians serving on medical staff committees of such hospitals) of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or not taken by him while acting in any such capacity, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. The termination of any such threatened or actual action or suit by a settlement or by an adverse judgment or order shall not of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation. Nevertheless, there shall be no indemnification with respect to expenses incurred in connection with any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

     8.4. Any indemnification under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof (unless ordered by a court), shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific cases upon a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the person claiming indemnification has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such Sections. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the shareholders.
