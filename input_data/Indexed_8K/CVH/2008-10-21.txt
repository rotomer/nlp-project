Coventry Health Care Reports Third Quarter Earnings
 
BETHESDA, Md. (October 21, 2008) - Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported consolidated operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Operating revenues totaled $2.98 billion for the quarter with net earnings of $85.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, including charges related to investment impairments and realized losses of $36.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. The Company has provided an explanation of major earnings drivers and a reconciliation of previous 2008 guidance to current 2008 guidance beginning on page 2.
 
"Our results for 2008 are unacceptable, and a great disappointment to me and the entire Company," said Dale B. Wolf, chief executive officer of Coventry. "However, we have identified and understand the issues that have affected our results. We have implemented a corrective action plan which we expect will increasingly be reflected in the Company's results throughout 2009 and fully realized in 2010. Most importantly, I continue to have confidence in our future prospects, both strategically and financially."
 
Third Quarter Highlights
 
Q4 2008 Guidance

Reconciliation of Previous 2008 EPS Guidance to Current 2008 EPS Guidance
The following table summarizes the changes in 2008 guidance as compared with the EPS midpoint of previously provided Company guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
The primary drivers of the change in 2008 guidance are outlined below:
 
Commercial Group Risk Medical Loss Ratio (MLR).
Upon observing a continuation of higher commercial medical trends into the third quarter, the Company conducted a detailed examination of each commercial health plan including the review of observed local trends, underwriting and rating mechanics, and block and single group performance. As a result of these reviews, the Company was able to validate that the elevated commercial medical trend observed in the third quarter was consistent with elevated levels observed in the second quarter of 2008. As we previously disclosed, the Company has initiated forward pricing action to account for the impact of these changes in medical trend. In addition, the Company was able to isolate unique circumstances specific to certain markets as outlined below, and has since taken corrective action on such issues. Due to the timing of implementation, the positive impact of these actions will have a minimal impact on the fourth quarter of 2008, be increasingly reflected in results throughout 2009, and fully reflected in results by 2010. Furthermore, the Company will reconsider its "slice" participation in certain FEHB risk markets for the 2010 calendar year. The following table quantifies items contributing to the change in 2008 guidance regarding the projected commercial group risk MLR:
 
 
 
 
Medicare Advantage MLR.
The Company expects the 2008 Medicare Advantage MLR to be approximately 88.7%, an increase of 300 bps from the Company's prior estimate, relating primarily to Medicare Advantage PFFS. Although there was no further 2007 negative prior period development during the third quarter in the Company's Medicare Advantage PFFS business, the second half of 2008 run-rate MLR is projected to be in the low to mid 90%'s, higher than the Company's previous expectations in the high 80%'s. The Company's Medicare Advantage HMO/PPO business continues to perform well in the low 80%'s, albeit slightly higher than previous expectations.
 
Investment Impairments and Realized Losses.
During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded investment impairments and realized losses of $36.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.
 
 
 
 
2009 Commentary
Historically, the Company has provided detailed forward year guidance coincident with the third quarter earnings call. Due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Company's changes in current year estimates, and the importance of visibility into the Medicare selling season, the Company will delay providing detailed 2009 guidance until mid-January at a scheduled investor conference. Accordingly, the Company's Investor Day will not be held on December 4, 2008 as previously scheduled.
