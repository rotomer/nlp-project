SECTION 2  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
ITEM 2.05  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
                 On April 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Coventry Health Care, Inc. (the "Company") agreed with Managements plan to not renew the Companys Medicare Advantage Private Fee For Service ("PFFS") product effective for the 2010 plan year. The Company considered a number of factors in determining to not renew its PFFS product, including the profitability of this product in light of federal reimbursement rates and medical cost trends, as well as the Company's intention to focus on other lines of business.  On May 1, 2009, the Company notified the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of its intention to cease offering PFFS products. This non-renewal will take effect at the end of the term of this current year, December 31, 2009.
 
                  Currently, it is not anticipated that the costs and related cash expenditures associated with the Companys developing exit plan will be material. Once the exit plan is finalized, the Company will disclose the estimated costs related to non-renewing of its PFFS product offering, if material.
 
                  The Company remains committed to its Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care network product and Part D products.
