Coventry Health Care Reports Second Quarter Earnings and Increases Full Year 2009 Guidance
 
GAAP Earnings of $0.12 per Diluted Share; Adjusted Earnings of $0.50 per Diluted Share
               
 
BETHESDA, Md. (July 28, 2009) - Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported consolidated operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Operating revenues totaled $3.5 billion for the quarter with GAAP net earnings of $18.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the First Health Services Corporation (FHSC) goodwill impairment, which resulted in a net $55.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, non-cash charge in the second quarter, adjusted net earnings were $73.8 million, or $0.50 per diluted share.
(1)
 
Excluding the impact of the anticipated FHSC divestiture and related current quarter goodwill impairment, the Company is increasing its full year 2009 adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS) guidance to a range of $1.85 to $1.95, an increase of $0.10 from the midpoint of the prior EPS range of $1.70 to $1.90. GAAP EPS for the full year is now expected to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.40 as, consistent with the FHSC divestiture announcement on June 5, 2009, the Company expects to record a largely non-cash full year charge of $0.55 to $0.60 per diluted share as a result of the transaction.
 
I am pleased with the financial and operational progress made by the Company during the past six months, said Allen F. Wise, chairman and chief executive officer of Coventry. Coventry remains focused on continually improving our seven core businesses while we work to deliver on our 2009 commitments. While there is always more hard work to be done, we are making progress as evidenced by todays increase to full year EPS guidance.
 
Second Quarter Consolidated Highlights
 
 
1) The Company believes that adjusting earnings to remove the unfavorable impact of the non-recurring FHSC divestiture-related impairment charge provides a more meaningful measure of its on-going operating results. See page two for further details.
