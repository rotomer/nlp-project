Coventry Health Care Reports Third Quarter Earnings and Increases Full Year 2009 Guidance
 
GAAP Earnings of $0.48 per Diluted Share; Adjusted Earnings of $0.66 per Diluted Share
               
 
BETHESDA, Md. (October 30, 2009) - Coventry Health Care, Inc. (NYSE: CVH) today reported consolidated operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Operating revenues totaled $3.4 billion for the quarter with GAAP net earnings of $70.6 million, or $0.48 earnings per diluted share (EPS). Excluding the impact of the First Health Services Corporation (FHSC) divestiture in the third quarter, which resulted in a net charge of $26.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, adjusted net earnings were $97.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share.
(1)
 
Excluding the impact of the FHSC divestiture, the Company is increasing its full year 2009 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $2.01 to $2.03, an increase of $0.12 from the midpoint of the prior EPS range of $1.85 to $1.95. GAAP EPS for the full year is now expected to be in a range of $1.45 to $1.47 as the Company has recorded a largely non-cash full year charge of $0.56 per diluted share as a result of the FHSC divestiture, as outlined on page two.
 
I continue to be pleased with the Companys financial and operational results for 2009 including todays increase to full year EPS guidance, said Allen F. Wise, chairman and chief executive officer of Coventry. In the face of a challenging environment, we feel confident that focusing on our seven core businesses and driving a low cost structure will best position Coventry for the future.
 
Third Quarter Consolidated Highlights
 
 
1) Adjusted earnings of $0.66 per diluted share include earnings from continuing operations of $0.68 per diluted share and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from FHSC operations during the quarter. The Company believes that adjusting earnings to exclude the unfavorable impact of the non-recurring FHSC divestiture-related charges provides a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to prior and future periods (and to previously announced guidance). See page two for further details.
