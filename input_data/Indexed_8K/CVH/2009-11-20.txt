On November 16, 2009, Coventry Health Care, Inc. (the Company) and its former Chief Financial Officer, Shawn M. Guertin, entered into a Separation and Consulting Agreement (the Agreement) setting forth the terms of Mr. Guertins resignation from his employment with the Company on December 31, 2009 (the Termination Date), and Mr. Guertins service to the Company as a consultant after the Termination Date.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Guertin will resign all officer and director positions with the Company but remain an employee until the Termination Date. Beginning January 1, 2010, Mr. Guertin will receive the benefits and compensation to which he would have been entitled under his employment agreement with the Company, dated on December 19, 2007 (the Prior Agreement), in the event of a Termination without Cause. The Restrictive Covenants Agreements signed by Mr. Guertin on September 26, 2008 and June 22, 2009, in exchange for certain equity awards, shall continue in full force and effect. All terms and conditions in the Prior Agreement that would continue in the event of a Termination without Cause shall continue in full force and effect.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Guertin will act as a consultant to the Company from January 1, 2010 until December 31, 2011, to (a) provide financial and business consulting services to the Company, (b) consult with the officers and executives of the Company, (c) provide periodic review and advice to the Company related to various financial matters and initiatives, and (d) provide assistance to the Company and its attorneys in defending various lawsuits filed against the Company. Mr. Guertin has agreed to devote, on average, three days per quarter in furtherance of such services, with additional time as required to assist in the defense of various lawsuits. As consideration for Mr. Guertins consulting services, the Company will pay Mr. Guertin $50,000 per calendar quarter during the term of the Agreement. Mr. Guertin is solely responsible for the payment of all federal, state and local taxes arising from such payments. Additionally, the Company has agreed to continue to provide medical, dental and vision benefits for Mr. Guertin and his family during the calendar year 2011.
 
The above summary of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 5.02(e) by reference.
