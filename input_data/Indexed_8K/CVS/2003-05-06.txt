WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, May 6, 2003CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 29, 2003.
 
Net sales for the first quarter ended March 29, 2003 increased 5.7% to a record $6.31 billion, up from $5.97 billion during the first quarter of 2002. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 3.9%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 7.1% and front-end same store sales decreased 2.7%. The Company estimates the Easter shift had a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points on front-end same store sales for the thirteen-week period. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 220 basis points for the quarter by recent generic drug introductions, which are being substituted for higher priced brand name drugs. Total pharmacy sales represented 69.4% of total company sales for the quarter. Third party prescription sales were 92.6% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter increased 11.7% to $196.3 million or $0.48 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $175.7 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2002. The Company's first quarter results were driven by a significant improvement in gross margin, which primarily reflects the increased usage of generic pharmaceuticals, and a reduction in markdowns due to better seasonal sell-through.
 
"I am very pleased with our first quarter results," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Corporation. "To achieve double-digit earnings growth while we continue to take share both in pharmacy and front store is gratifying in this environment," continued Mr. Ryan.
 
For the first quarter, CVS opened 37 new stores, closed 25 and relocated 24 others. As of March 29, 2003, CVS operated 4,099 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
 
As reported in a separate press release today, April sales increased 9.3% to $1.98 billion, compared to $1.81 billion in the prior year period. April same store sales rose 7.1% while pharmacy same store sales increased 7.0% and front-end same store sales increased 7.4%. April sales partially benefited from a later Easter this year, which shifted some holiday sales from March into April. Sales for the combined months of March and April 2003 increased 6.6% compared to the same two months in 2002. Same store sales for the March/April period rose 4.4%, while pharmacy same store sales increased 6.6% and front-end same store sales decreased 0.1%.
