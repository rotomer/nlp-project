Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, July 30, 2003CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced sales and earnings for the second quarter ended June 28, 2003.
 
Net sales for the second quarter ended June 28, 2003 increased 7.6% to a record $6.44 billion, up from $5.99 billion during the second quarter of 2002. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 5.5%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 7.5% and front-end same store sales increased 1.4%. The Company estimates the Easter shift had a positive impact of approximately 200 basis points on front-end same store sales for the thirteen-week period. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 200 basis points for the quarter by recent generic drug introductions, which are being substituted for higher priced brand name drugs. Total pharmacy sales represented 68.9% of total company sales for the quarter. Third party prescription sales were 92.6% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the second quarter increased 13.3% to $199.8 million or $0.49 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $176.4 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2002. The Company's second quarter results were driven by the growth in sales, and a significant improvement in gross margin, which primarily reflects the increased usage of generic pharmaceuticals and improvements in inventory losses.
 
"This was an outstanding quarter that is clearly reflected in the sales growth and 14% increase in CVS' diluted earnings per share. Pharmacy sales momentum continued to pick up throughout the quarter, while gross margin increased solidly," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Corporation. "We also made excellent progress on the rollout of our Pharmacy Service Initiative as well as our AIM inventory initiative for pharmacy in-stock positions. Both are helping us gain market share," Mr. Ryan continued. "Our new store expansion program is right on track and we expect that it will give us a solid platform for long-term growth."
 
For the second quarter, CVS opened 26 new stores, closed 12 and relocated 24 others. As of June 28, 2003, CVS operated 4,113 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
