Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, October 29, 2003CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced sales and earnings for the third quarter ended September 27, 2003.
 
Net sales for the third quarter ended September 27, 2003 increased 8.5% to $6.38 billion, up from $5.88 billion during the third quarter of 2002. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 6.4%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 8.5% and front-end same store sales increased 1.9%. Total pharmacy sales represented 69.4% of total company sales for the quarter. Third party prescription sales were 93.0% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter increased 14.2% to $187.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $164.4 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2002. The Company's third quarter results compared to last year were driven by strong margin performance due to a more profitable product assortment and continued improvements in inventory losses.
 
"The third quarter was another great quarter for CVS," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved strong sales growth with both the pharmacy and front-end businesses showing sequential growth, generated healthy cash flow, and increased diluted earnings per share by 15%. Operating margin increased due to the significant improvement in our gross margin, coupled with continued effective cost management."
 
Mr. Ryan continued, "During the quarter, we completed the rollout of our AIM inventory initiative for pharmacy, and made solid progress on the rollout of our Pharmacy Service Initiative. Both are helping us to continue to gain market share, and our customers are telling us that they're noticing our service enhancements. We will remain highly focused on making CVS the easiest pharmacy for customers to use."
 
For the third quarter, CVS opened 31 new stores, closed 7 and relocated 18 others. As of September 27, 2003, CVS operated 4,137 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
 
In a separate release today, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to common stockholders. The quarterly dividend was raised to $0.06625 per share, payable February 3, 2004 to holders of record on January 22, 2004. This increase translates into an annual rate of $0.265 per share, up $0.035 from the previous rate of $0.230.
