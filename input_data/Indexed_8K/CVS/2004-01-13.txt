Pharmacy same store sales increased 11.2%, while front-end same store sales increased 6.1%. Total pharmacy sales represented 65.2% of total company sales in December.

Pharmacy same store sales increased 8.1%, while front-end same store sales increased 1.2%.
 
"I am extremely pleased with our sales growth in December, especially in the last two weeks of the month," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Corporation. "We achieved strong sales results in both the pharmacy and front-end businesses. The flu season was earlier than last year and stronger than it has been for several years. This drove both incremental pharmacy sales and the front-end cough and cold category. We also achieved record holiday sales, which continued to be unexpectedly strong after Christmas," continued Ryan.
 
"While our books are not yet closed for the year, a strong flu season and healthy sales mix enhanced our margin performance. Given the strong trends in our business, we now expect to exceed our previous diluted earnings per share guidance for 2003, which was a range of $1.95-$2.00 per share."
