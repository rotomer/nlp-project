The Rhode Island State Police are currently investigating this matter as well as business relationships between Rhode Island elected officials and other Rhode Island companies. Other recent press reports indicate that the United States Attorney's Office may also be considering whether to conduct an investigation of these matters. CVS is cooperating fully in the investigation of this matter and has retained former Rhode Island Attorney General Jeffrey B. Pine to conduct a complete review of its conduct and related policies.
