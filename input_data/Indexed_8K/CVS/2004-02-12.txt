EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, February 12, 2004 - CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and the year ended January 3, 2004.
 
Net sales for the fourteen-week period ended January 3, 2004 increased 17.5% to a record $7.45 billion, up from $6.34 billion during the thirteen-week period ended December 28, 2002. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the fourteen-week period increased 7.4% over the comparable prior year fourteen-week period, while pharmacy same store sales rose 9.1% and front-end same store sales increased 3.9%. For the fifty-three week period ended January 3, 2004 net sales increased 10.0% to a record $ 26.59 billion, compared to $24.18 billion during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2002. Same store sales for the fifty-three week period increased 5.8% over the comparable prior year fifty-three week period, while pharmacy same store sales increased 8.1% and front-end same store sales increased 1.2%. Total pharmacy sales represented 67.8% of total company sales for the quarter and 68.8% for the year, while third party prescription sales were 93.3% of pharmacy sales for the quarter and 93.2% for the year.
 
Net earnings for the fourteen-week fourth quarter increased 31.6% to $263.4 million or $0.64 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $200.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the thirteen-week fourth quarter of 2002. The Company's fourth quarter results were driven by strong sales growth and a significant improvement in gross margin, which resulted from a reduction in inventory losses, a strong flu season and an improved sales mix.
 
Net earnings for the year increased to $847.3 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, up 17.7% from the $1.75 per diluted share reported in 2002. The Company's results for the year were better than anticipated primarily due to the unusual severity of the flu season and the results of the 53
rd
week, which surpassed original expectations. The Company estimates that the 53
rd
week added approximately $0.05 per diluted share, or $0.02 per diluted share more than original expectations.
 
"2003 was the best year in our 40-year history, with sales hitting an all-time high of $26.6 billion. Our new store expansion program is having an increasingly positive impact on our total revenues as we continue to add more net new stores," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and CEO of CVS Corporation. "Across the Company, we have established tremendous momentum as we work to make CVS the easiest pharmacy for customers to use."
 
"I am very pleased with our financial performance, which was characterized by significant gross margin improvement and solid cost containment, despite planned investments to drive future growth," continued Mr. Ryan. "Our balance sheet remains among the best in our industry, with low leverage and excellent working capital ratios. In fact, we exceeded our annual inventory turnover goal, placing us in an industry-leading position among national retailers on that important productivity measure."
For the year, CVS opened 150 new stores, closed 58 and relocated 125 others. As of January 3, 2004, CVS operated 4,179 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
 
As reported in a separate press release today, January sales increased 6.9% to $2.04 billion, compared to $1.91 billion in the prior year period. January same store sales rose 5.6% while pharmacy same store sales increased 8.2% and front-end same store sales were nearly flat to last year.
