Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure.
CVS Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, CVS Pharmacy, Inc., have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of April 4, 2004 with J.C. Penney, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including Eckerd Corporation, to acquire from Eckerd and other sellers listed in the Asset Purchase Agreement, approximately 1,260 Eckerd drugstores (located mainly in the southern United States, including Texas and Florida) as well as Eckerd's mail order, specialty pharmacy and pharmacy benefits management businesses.
CVS' acquisition of the drugstores is structured as an asset purchase, while the acquisition of the pharmacy benefit management business is structured as a stock purchase under the Asset Purchase Agreement. The purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement is $2.15 billion, subject to adjustment post-closing based on the change in working capital of the acquired business as of closing.
J.C. Penney simultaneously entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with The Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. to sell, immediately after the closing of the CVS acquisition, the remaining business of Eckerd (principally drugstores in certain Northern and mid-Atlantic states) to Coutu in a stock transaction. In connection with these transactions, CVS and Coutu entered into a framework agreement relating to the separation of the businesses respectively being acquired from J.C. Penney (and certain assets and liabilities) between CVS and Coutu upon the closing of the transactions. CVS' acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Furthermore, closing of the CVS acquisition is cross-conditioned on closing of the Coutu acquisition. However, this cross-condition will be deemed satisfied in the event the Coutu acquisition from J.C. Penney does not close as a result of an inability to obtain sufficient financing. We are advised by Coutu that they have a full financing commitment from their lenders.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Asset Purchase Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The press release announcing the entering into of the Asset Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

For the avoidance of doubt, the occurrence of an Excluded Liability item (for example taxes) on the Balance Sheet, the Related Financials, the Audited Financial Statements or the Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements does not mean that such item is not an Excluded Liability. Section 1.05. Purchase of Southern Entity Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Stock Sellers shall sell and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from the Stock Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Southern Entity (collectively, "Southern Entity Shares") free and clear of all Liens or Encumbrances, other than any Liens or Encumbrances created by the Purchaser and any restrictions on transferability under applicable securities Laws. Section 1.06. Financial Statements. (a) Prior to the Closing Parent will deliver to the Purchaser true and complete copies of the financial statements of the Southern Business as of and for the fiscal year ended on the Balance Sheet Date, together with the notes relating thereto prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X (the "Audited Financial Statements"). The Audited Financial Statements will be prepared on a basis consistent with the Balance Sheet and Related Financials and in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and adhering to the Balance Sheet Principles. (b) Promptly after the applicable Quarter Date (but in no event later than 45 calendar days after the Closing Date), Parent will deliver to the Purchaser true and complete copies of the financial statements of the Southern Business as of and for the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Southern Business ended after the Balance Sheet Date but prior to the Closing Date ("Quarter Date"), together with the notes relating thereto, which may be condensed in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements") prepared on a basis consistent with the Balance Sheet and Related Financials and in accordance with GAAP and adhering to the Balance Sheet Principles. The Parent will require its independent auditors to review the Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements in accordance with guidance provided in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100. (c) The Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited Quarterly Financial Statements shall comply with all of the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act") and as applicable to the Purchaser. Section 1.07. Unadjusted Purchase Price. The unadjusted purchase price for the Purchased Assets and the Southern Entity Shares shall be $2,150,000,000 8
(Two Billion One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars) in cash (the "Unadjusted Purchase Price"). Section 1.08. Conditional Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Stock Purchase Agreement contains, or is amended after the date of this Agreement to contain, a provision adjusting the payment of the "purchase price" set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement as of the date hereof based upon a multiple of EBITDA or similar earnings or other financial measure, or if there is any similar agreement or arrangement between the Parent or its affiliates or agents on the one hand or the Stock Purchaser or its affiliates or agents on the other, then a substantially similar provision shall be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and the Estimated Purchase Price and Purchase Price hereunder shall be adjusted by using a substantially similar principle modified as necessary to be applicable to the Southern Business. In the event of a dispute between the parties with respect to the adjustment, the Purchaser shall wire transfer the Estimated Purchase Price, and the amount of any adjustment shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.11(b) and Section 1.11(c), and any payments following such determination shall be in accordance with Section 1.11(e), and such provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to matters covered by this Section 1.08. Section 1.09. Estimated Purchase Price. (a) Not later than the third business day prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement") setting forth the Parent's estimate of Closing Working Capital ("Estimated Closing Working Capital") and the Parent's calculation thereof in reasonable detail. The Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting principles, methodologies, policies and practices used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet (including the Balance Sheet Principles) and shall be based upon Parent's review of the financial information then available to it. (b) "Estimated Purchase Price" shall mean a cash amount equal to the Unadjusted Purchase Price plus or minus the amount by which Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater or less, respectively, than the Baseline Number. The Baseline Number was calculated by the Parent (as described on Schedule A) and represents the Working Capital as of January 31, 2004. Section 1.10. Physical Inventory. In the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Parent will cause RGIS Inventory Specialists (the "Inventory Firm") to undertake a UPC item-level physical inventory in (i) each of the two hundred (200) Southern Stores listed on Section 1.10 of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) Southern Distribution Centers. These physical inventories will be in addition to Parent's normal recurring physical inventories taken by the Inventory Firm which will include approximately ten percent (10%) of the Southern Stores per month and in addition include normal recurring 9
physical inventories of the PBM Business, the Mail Order Business and the Specialty Pharmacy Business. Parent will provide Purchaser ten (10) calendar days prior notice of the date on which the physical inventory will be taken at the applicable Southern Site and each party will have an employee and/or agent present during each physical inventory at each Southern Site taken by the Inventory Firm. Purchaser will be entitled to receive a copy of the electronic UPC item-level physical inventory file for each inventory taken by the Inventory Firm. The results of the physical inventory will be recorded in the Closing Date Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 1.11) and the Closing Working Capital Statement (as defined in Section 1.11) on all relevant items including "Merchandise Inventory-FIFO" and "Inventory Reserves". In addition, Parent and Purchaser will use the aggregate shrink rate trend calculated from physical inventories taken in all of the two hundred (200) Southern Stores listed on Section 1.10 of the Disclosure Schedule to adjust the shrink reserves for the remaining Southern Stores and reflect the projected physical inventory number for such Southern Stores in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement on all relevant items including "Merchandise Inventory-FIFO" and "Inventory Reserves". The Purchaser and the Parent agree that, absent manifest error, the physical inventory counts of the Inventory Firm shall be final and binding on each of the parties. Section 1.11. Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) Closing Working Capital Statement. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Parent (i) a statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Southern Business as of and including the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"), prepared using the same accounting principles, methodologies, policies and practices used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet (including the Balance Sheet Principles), and (ii) a statement setting forth the Purchaser's calculation of Closing Working Capital (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). Each of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement shall include items that are updated in accordance with Section 1.10. (b) Review of Closing Working Capital Statement. Within 45 calendar days after the delivery to the Parent of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement (the "Parent Review Period"), the Parent shall notify the Purchaser of its agreement or disagreement with the Closing Working Capital Statement. If the Parent in good faith disagrees with the Purchaser's determination of Closing Working Capital, the Parent may deliver to the Purchaser, prior to the expiration of the Parent Review Period, a notice (the "Parent Objection Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the items or amounts with which the Parent disagrees and the basis for such disagreement and (ii) the Parent's proposed corrections to the Closing Working Capital Statement (collectively, the "Parent Objection"). If the Parent does not deliver a Parent Objection Notice within the Parent Review Period, the Parent shall be deemed to 10
agree in all respects with the Closing Working Capital Statement and the items and amounts reflected thereon shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Parent. (c) Review by Accountants. If a Parent Objection Notice is properly and timely delivered and the Purchaser and the Parent are unable to resolve any disagreement between them with respect to the determination of Closing Working Capital within 30 calendar days after delivery of a Parent Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the Parent shall cause PriceWaterhouseCoopers (or, if they are unable or unwilling to serve, a firm of accountants of nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Parent) (the "Accountants") to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts in the Closing Working Capital Statement for the purpose of resolving such dispute. The Accountants shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Working Capital Statement as to which the Parent has, in the Parent Objection Notice, disagreed and such other issues as may reasonably be affected by the items to which the Parent has so disagreed. The Accountants shall be required to deliver to the Purchaser and the Parent, as promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 calendar days after the Accountants are engaged, a written report setting forth their resolution and, if applicable, their calculation of the disputed items or amounts. In no event shall the Accountants' determination result in Closing Working Capital that is greater than that set forth in the Parent Objection Notice or less than that set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement. The parties shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Accountants for information, books, records and similar items. Upon delivery of the Accountants' report, such report and the calculations set forth therein shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser and the Parent absent manifest error. The cost of such review and report shall be split equally by the Purchaser and the Parent. (d) Cooperation. Each of the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Parent shall cooperate and assist each other in the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 1.11, and the Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate and assist the Parent and the Stock Purchaser in the review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing Working Capital Statement described in the Stock Purchase Agreement, including without limitation (i) the Purchaser making available to the extent necessary or helpful books, records, workpapers and personnel of the Southern Business, (ii) the Parent making available to the extent necessary or helpful books and records of the Parent (as they relate to the Business), and (iii) the Sellers making available to the extent necessary or helpful books, records, workpapers and personnel of the Northern Business (and any books, records and workpapers relating to the Southern Business in their possession). (e) Final Payment. Within three business days after the calculation of Closing Working Capital becoming final pursuant to Section 1.11(b) or Section 1.11(c), as applicable, (i) the Purchaser shall pay to the Parent, by wire transfer of 11
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Parent, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which Closing Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.11(b) or Section 1.11(c), as applicable) minus $44,000,000 exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital, together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment, or (ii) the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing Working Capital plus $44,000,000 exceeds Closing Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.11(b) or Section 1.11(c), as applicable), together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment. Section 1.12. Intercompany Obligations. Prior to the Closing, the Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, eliminate all intercompany obligations of the Southern Entities other than trade payables and trade receivables. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and regardless of their being reflected on the Balance Sheet, intercompany obligations attributable to the Southern Business (if any) other than trade receivables and payables shall not be included in any of the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Working Capital, Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement or Closing Working Capital Statement. Section 1.13. Failed Landlord Consents. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Sellers will seek to obtain the consents of all landlords whose consent is required to assign an applicable Southern Site Lease to Purchaser and will provide notices to all landlords whose Southern Site Leases require notice in connection with an assignment. As part of such effort, Parent and Sellers shall make its lease files available to Purchaser at Sellers' offices or at such other location as the parties may agree for such purpose. Purchaser shall cooperate in such efforts and shall provide Parent and Sellers with any required documents or deliveries required under the applicable Southern Site Leases to effect such lease assignments. If within a nine month period following the Closing Date (the "Landlord Consent Period"), a Landlord Objection is received with respect to any Southern Site Lease (any such Southern Site, a "Problem Site"), and such Landlord Objection is not withdrawn despite the Purchaser or its affiliates making all good faith efforts, other than agreeing to pay increased rent or agreeing to vacate the Problem Site or agreeing to any other restriction on use of such Problem Site, then the Purchaser may at its reasonable option: (i) vacate such Problem Site and close the business and operations at such Problem Site (the aggregate costs associated with all such vacations and closures of all such Problem Sites, the "Closure Costs"); 12
(ii) vacate such Problem Site and lease an alternative site on at-market terms ("New Site") (the aggregate amount by which the rent for all New Sites (for the same term as the remainder of the term for the applicable Problem Site) and vacation and relocation costs exceed the aggregate rent for the remaining term of all applicable Problem Sites, the "Replacement Site Costs"); or (iii) negotiate with the applicable landlord and agree to modified lease terms for the applicable Problem Site, which reflect fair market terms and conditions, subject to providing notice to Parent and Sellers of such modified terms (the aggregate amounts by which the new rent/occupancy costs for all Problem Sites (for the same term as the remainder of the term for the applicable Problem Site) exceed the aggregate rent for the remaining term of all applicable Problem Sites, the "Increased Occupancy Costs", and together with the Replacement Site Costs and Closure Costs, on a pre-tax basis, the "Increased Costs"). provided that in the first instance, Purchaser shall make commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate with the applicable landlord and agree to modified lease terms for the applicable Problem Site pursuant to clause (iii) above and only upon failing to reach agreement with the applicable landlord on commercially reasonable terms, the Purchaser will use its rights under clauses (i) or (ii) at its sole option; and provided further that "commercially reasonable efforts" and "commercially reasonable terms" shall not require the Purchaser, in its reasonable judgment, to accept other than a "de minimis" restriction on the use, access, signage, visibility or parking associated with the applicable Problem Site. For the avoidance of doubt, references to "de minimis" under this Section 1.13 shall not be construed by reference to the definition of a "De Minimis Matter" in Section 7.04(a). (b) If the net present value (using the Applicable Rate as of the Closing Date as the discount rate) of the Increased Costs exceeds $1,000,000 (such amount, the "Excess Amount"), the Purchaser shall, within 60 calendar days of the end of the Landlord Consent Period, deliver to the Parent a statement of the Purchaser's calculation of the Excess Amount. The Parent shall have 45 calendar days to dispute such Excess Amount ("Dispute"), and in the event of a Dispute, the provisions of Section 1.11(b) and Section 1.11(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis. (c) Within three business days after the calculation of Excess Amount becoming final after resolution of the dispute in accordance with Section 1.13(b), the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser, an amount equal to one-half of the Excess Amount (if any, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.13(b)) together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the date of delivery of the statement of Excess Amount by the Purchaser to, but excluding, the date of such payment. 13
(d) Any party receiving a Landlord Objection shall notify all other parties in accordance with Section 8.04. (e) Purchaser will keep Parent reasonably informed of developments and circumstances regarding the foregoing matters in Section 1.13 and will act in good faith with respect to such matters. (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.13, if the Parent or the Sellers and the Purchaser are able to mutually agree upon any reasonable and lawful arrangement pursuant to Section 1.16 which would provide Purchaser with the benefits under any applicable Southern Site Lease, without any increased rent or material inconvenience or other than a "de minimis" restriction referred to in Section 1.13(a), and which does not cause the affected Southern Site Lease to be terminated or to be declared in default by the applicable landlord, Purchaser shall not have the right to exercise any of the remedies set forth in Section 1.13 and such Southern Site will not be considered a Problem Site. Section 1.14. Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article 6, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 5, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and the Southern Entity Shares and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder (the "Closing") will take place as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 10:00 a.m., Dallas time, on the fifth business day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 5, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (which includes the condition set forth in Section 5.01(c)), but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions, at the offices of Jones Day, Dallas, Texas, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers: (i) the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by the Sellers provided that the wiring of funds to two or more separate accounts will not be for the purpose of, and shall not have the effect of, allocating the Purchase Price amongst the Purchased Assets and the Southern Entity Shares, which allocation shall be in accordance with Section 4.11(e), or otherwise have an adverse economic effect on the Purchaser; (ii) a certificate of the Purchaser, dated the Closing Date and signed by an authorized officer of the Purchaser, certifying that the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(a) have been satisfied; 14

Section 4.03. Acquisition Proposals; Inconsistent Activities. (a) Acquisition Proposals. Following the execution of this Agreement, the Sellers and the Parent shall, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by any of the foregoing Persons (collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 4.03(b)) with respect to the Southern Business, and shall not, and shall cause their Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, facilitate, encourage or solicit, directly or indirectly, the making of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Southern Business, (ii) provide any non-public information regarding the Sellers or any of the Southern Entities to, or enter into or maintain or continue any discussions or negotiations 42

Section 4.04. Access To Information; Confidentiality; Data Bridge Development. (a) The Parent and the Sellers shall afford to CVS, the Purchaser and their Representatives reasonable access (with an opportunity to make copies) (subject, however, to existing confidentiality and similar non-disclosure obligations) during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice during the period prior to the Closing to all of the Parent's, the Sellers' and the Southern Entities' properties, books, records (whether in hard copy or computer format), workpapers, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, personnel and records relating to the Southern Business or the Purchased Assets and, during such period, the Parent and the Sellers shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, as promptly as practicable to the Purchaser such information (subject, however, to existing confidentiality and similar non-disclosure obligations) concerning the Southern Entities, the Southern Business and the Purchased Assets as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request. To the extent that the Parent or any Seller 43
incurs any incremental out-of-pocket costs in processing, retrieving or transmitting any such information pursuant to this Section 4.04(a), the Purchaser shall reimburse the Parent or the appropriate Seller for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs thereof promptly upon the submission to the Purchaser of an invoice therefor accompanied by supporting documentation in reasonable detail provided however that de minimis expenses in the individual amount of $1,000 or less shall be excluded from the reimbursement obligation under this Section 4.04(a).

(c) After the date hereof and until the Closing, as reasonably necessary and available, taking into account the reasonable needs of the Stock Purchaser, the Sellers and their affiliates shall provide the Purchaser and its affiliates with the use of office space as the Purchaser reasonably requests at such locations as reasonably necessary and available, taking into account the reasonable needs of the Stock Purchaser, for the Purchaser and its affiliates to prepare for transition of the Southern Business into its own business.

manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 5. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings (which in any event shall be made by no later than the 14th day following the date hereof, the timing of which shall be coordinated with one another's filings and with the filing of the Stock Purchaser to the extent practicable) and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other appropriate actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Pharmacy Approvals and all other Approvals of Governmental Entities as are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill the conditions thereto.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition. (c) In performing the parties' obligations under Section 4.05, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. In connection with the foregoing, if any Action, including any Action by any Person, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the parties shall cooperate in all respects 45
with each other and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such suit, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment or order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law (an "Antitrust Objection") or if any suit, action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental Entity or other Person challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law (an "Antitrust Challenge"), each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 4.05(d), "reasonable best efforts" by CVS shall include without limitation, CVS and/or the Purchaser (and, to the extent required by any Governmental Entity, their Subsidiaries and affiliates) entering into a settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or other agreement (a "Settlement") with a Governmental Entity regarding antitrust matters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, entering into a Settlement that requires CVS or the Purchaser to hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise) or to sell or otherwise dispose of particular assets and/or withdraw from doing business in particular geographic areas, to satisfy any Antitrust Objections or to settle any Antitrust Challenges, but, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, CVS or the Purchaser shall not be required to enter into any Settlement (i) that requires CVS or the Purchaser to hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise) or to sell or otherwise dispose of or withdraw from stores of CVS or the Purchaser (and their Subsidiaries) or Southern Stores the aggregate revenues of which (for the most recent fiscal year) exceeded $500 million ("Antitrust Store Limit") or (ii) as a result of which the aggregate gross margin attributable to business of Pharmacare or PBM Business to be terminated or otherwise lost pursuant to such Settlement would be greater than 35% of the total gross margin attributable to such business for the most recently ended fiscal year ("Antitrust PBM Limit"). (e) In the event that the Settlement pursuant to this Section 4.05 requires CVS or the Purchaser to hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise) or to sell or otherwise dispose of or withdraw from stores of CVS or the Purchaser (and their Subsidiaries) or Southern Stores the aggregate revenues of which (for the most recent fiscal year) exceeded $200 million but were below $500 million (the applicable excess of such aggregate revenues above $200 million, the "Band Number"), (i) the Estimated Purchase Price and the Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be reduced by an amount that is 0.25 times the Band Number and (ii) upon the sale or other disposition of any stores that CVS or the Purchaser is required to hold separate, sell or otherwise dispose of pursuant to such settlement, the Parent shall be entitled to receive a portion of such proceeds equal to fifty percent of: (x) the amount of all proceeds (less the reasonable costs 46
incurred in connection with the sale or disposition) multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Band Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate revenues (for the most recent fiscal year) of such stores divested. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a Settlement proposed by a Governmental Entity pursuant to this Section 4.05 would have required CVS or the Purchaser to hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise) or to sell or otherwise dispose of or withdraw from assets or business of the Pharmacare or PBM Business in excess of the Antitrust PBM Limit, and if CVS refuses to enter into such Settlement, then the sale and purchase of the PBM Business (through the sale and purchase of the shares of the PBM Entity, Genplus Managed Care, Inc., and Eckerd Corporation Of Florida, Inc. and Purchased Assets of the PBM Business and assumption of Assumed Liabilities of the PBM Business) shall be excluded from this Agreement, the Baseline Number shall be recalculated to exclude the assets and liabilities of the PBM Business, and the assets and liabilities of the PBM Business shall be excluded from the calculation of Working Capital, Estimated Closing Working Capital and Closing Working Capital Statement. On the Closing Date, notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Purchaser will wire transfer to the Sellers, the Estimated Purchase Price reduced by an amount equal to $750,000,000 (such reduced portion of the Estimated Purchase Price, the "Estimated PBM Price"). The amount of Purchase Price actually allocable to the PBM Business shall be determined pursuant to Section 4.11(e) (such price, the "Final PBM Price"). Within three business days of the Final PBM Price becoming final pursuant to Section 4.11(e), (i) the Purchaser shall pay to the Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Parent, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Final PBM Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 4.11(e)) exceeds the Estimated PBM Price, together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment, or (ii) the Parent shall pay to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser, an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Estimated PBM Price exceeds the Final PBM Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 4.11(e)), together with interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything else contained herein, in the circumstances contemplated in this Section 4.05(f), the Purchase Price hereunder will be reduced by the Final PBM Price. Section 4.06. Public Announcements. Purchaser and CVS, on the one hand, and the Parent and Sellers on the other hand will use their best efforts to coordinate and simultaneously release their first public announcement or press release relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser and CVS, on the one hand, and the Parent and Sellers on the other hand shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, SEC filing or other written public statements with respect to the 47
transactions contemplated hereby (including the first public announcement or press release) and shall not issue any such press release or written public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, by court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Section 4.07. Further Assurances; No Hindrances. From time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration, each of the Parent, the Sellers, CVS and the Purchaser will execute and deliver such further instruments and take such other action as may be necessary, or as may be reasonably requested by the other party, to make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including to give the Purchaser the title or benefit of the Purchased Assets or assets of the Southern Entities as contemplated hereunder. Section 4.08. Notices of Certain Events. After the execution of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Parent shall, and shall cause their Representatives to promptly notify the Purchaser in writing in reasonable detail of: (a) any written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that the Approval of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (b) the damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of any material asset of the Southern Business or any material part thereof or in the event that any material asset of the Southern Business or material part thereof becomes the subject of any proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened proceeding for the taking thereof or any part thereof or of any right relating thereto by condemnation, eminent domain or other similar governmental action. Section 4.09. Notice of Possible Breach. Prior to the Closing, if any party to this Agreement shall become aware of any fact, event or circumstance that would constitute a breach of this Agreement by the other party or that would result in the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Article 5, such party shall promptly notify the other party thereof in writing. The parties shall thereupon provide reasonable cooperation to cure or remedy such breaches or satisfy such closing conditions. Section 4.10. Prescription Files.

Each of (A) the Purchaser, (B) the Southern Entities, (C) the Parent, and (D) the Sellers shall give the other parties reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books or records and, if another party so requests, the other party shall take possession of such books and records. Any information obtained under this Section 4.11(c) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. (d) Allocation of Certain Taxes. (i) All real property taxes (other than real estate Taxes referred to in Section 4.20), personal property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a Straddle Tax Period (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between the Parent and the Purchaser based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. The Parent shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and the Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. (ii) All excise, sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Parent and the Purchaser. The Purchaser, the Parent and the Sellers shall cooperate in providing each other with any appropriate resale exemption certifications and other similar documentation. 50
(iii) Apportioned Obligations and Transfer Taxes described in this Section 4.11(d) shall be timely paid, and all applicable Tax Returns shall be filed, as provided by applicable Law. The paying party shall provide to the non-paying party drafts of all Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence and a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled under Section 4.11(d)(i) and Section 4.11(d)(ii), as the case may be, together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including extensions), or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely filing of any such Tax Return. Any such Transfer Tax Returns shall reflect any valuations available from the Independent Valuation Expert or, if a valuation is not available, the practices and methodologies expected to be employed by the Independent Valuation Expert. If no such information is available from the Independent Valuation Expert, the parties will agree upon a reasonable methodology for determining the valuations necessary for preparing such Tax Returns. At least 15 calendar days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including extensions), or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely filing of such Tax Return, the non-paying party shall notify the paying party of the existence of any objection (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection) the non-paying party may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return. The paying party and the non-paying party agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. Upon earlier of the resolution of such objection, if any, or the expiration of the fifteen days without objection from the non-paying party, the paying party may file the Tax Return. The paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party in accordance with Section 4.11(d)(i) and Section 4.11(d)(ii), as the case may be. The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 30 calendar days after the filing of such Tax Return. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate for each day after the expiration of the 30 calendar days described in the preceding sentence until paid. (e) Allocation of Purchase Price. (i) Within 6 months of the finalization of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Parent a GAAP-based valuation performed by a nationally recognized independent valuation firm mutually agreed by the Parent and the Purchaser (the "Independent Valuation Expert") ascribing values, as of the Closing Date, on a location-by-location basis, to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the assets and liabilities of the Southern Entities. Within 30 calendar days after the Purchaser delivers the valuation, the Parent shall notify the Purchaser of any objection to the valuation (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection), provided that no such objection shall be made unless it is based on a manifest error in the valuation. If the Independent Valuation Expert concurs that a manifest error has been made, 51
the Independent Valuation Expert shall cause the valuation to be corrected. If the Independent Valuation Expert does not so concur, or the Seller does not make any objection within such 30 calendar day period, the original valuation shall be the final valuation. The Purchaser, the Southern Entities, the Parent, the Sellers and their affiliates agree to act in accordance with the final valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert in the preparation and filing of any Income Tax Return and in the making of any Section 338(h)(10) Election. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Valuation Expert shall be borne by the Purchaser. (ii) No later than 60 calendar days after the finalization of the valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Parent pro forma Forms 8594 and the supporting documentation. The pro forma Forms 8594 shall set forth an allocation of the Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code, but without regard to either party's transaction costs) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The Parent shall have the right to review such forms solely for the purpose of determining whether the allocation has been made in accordance with the final valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert delivered pursuant to Section 4.11(e). If, within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the pro forma forms, the Parent notifies the Purchaser that the Parent objects to the pro forma forms on the basis that they do not reflect the valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert, then the Parent and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement within the 15 calendar days following the Parent's notification of Purchaser of such disagreement and the pro forma forms shall be amended before filing to reflect any such resolution. Within 15 calendar days after the later of (A) the date on which the Purchaser and the Parent shall have resolved any objections or (B) the failure of the Parent to notify the Purchaser of an objection within 15 calendar days, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its final Forms 8594. (f) Information. Within 60 days after the finalization of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Purchaser shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered to the Parent (at no cost to the Parent) copies of books, records, workpapers, and any other supporting documents used to prepare such final Closing Date Balance Sheet to the extent such documentation is in the possession of the Purchaser or its affiliates and is reasonably required by the Parent to properly report the operations of the Purchased Assets and the Southern Entities in its Tax Returns. To the extent such documentation is not in the possession of the Purchaser or its affiliates, the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to assist the Parent in obtaining any further information that may be required for the Parent to properly report the operations of the Purchased Assets and the Southern Entities in its Tax Returns. (g) Tax Matters Relating to the Oklahoma Sites. With respect to each Southern Site in Oklahoma, the Parent will use its reasonable efforts to pay or 52
cause to be paid, prior to the Closing Date, all Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period required to be paid by the Parent, the Sellers or any of their affiliates to the Oklahoma Tax Commission, the nonpayment of which could result in any Governmental Entity denying Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's affiliates any license or permit relating to any Southern Site in Oklahoma. The Parent, each of the Sellers and each other affiliate of the Parent further agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser, upon Purchaser's reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, proof of payment of any Tax that the Parent, the Sellers or any of their affiliates has paid to the Oklahoma Tax Commission for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event any provision of this Section 4.11(g) is inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this 4.11(g) shall control. Section 4.12.

(b) Tax Sharing Agreements. Effective as of the Closing, any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement or arrangement between the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Southern Entities) and any of the Southern Entities shall be terminated and shall have no further effect thereafter. All rights and obligations of the Parent and the Stock Sellers, on the one hand, and the Southern Entities, on the other hand, with respect to Taxes shall be provided in this Section 4.12. (c) The Parent's Tax Returns for Periods Through the Closing Date.

(ii) The Parent or its designee shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and, if required to be signed by Purchaser, any of its affiliates or any of the Southern Entities, shall deliver, within 15 calendar days prior to the deadline for the filing of such Tax Returns, to the Purchaser for signing and filing (A) all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns for Taxes any component of which may be based in whole, or in part, on net income or a taxable base in the nature of net income of the Parent or any of its affiliates which include any of the Southern Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (B) all other Tax Returns for Taxes any component of which may be based in whole, or in part, on net income or a taxable base in the nature of net income of the Southern Entities with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date, provided that the Purchaser shall have the right to review in accordance with the principles of Sections 4.11(e) and 54
4.12(d) any such Tax Returns which it or the Southern Entities are required to sign. The Parent shall pay or shall cause to be paid any and all Taxes shown as due with respect to Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence. (iii) The Parent shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Southern Entities subject to Section 4.12(c)(i) and Section 4.12(c)(ii) that are due with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such authority shall include, but not be limited to, the determination of the manner in which any items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit arising out of the income, properties and operations of the Southern Entities shall be reported or disclosed in such Tax Returns; provided, however, that such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Law. (iv) With respect to any taxable period of the Southern Entities that would otherwise include but not end on the Closing Date, to the extent permissible, but not required, pursuant to applicable Tax Law, the Parent and the Purchaser or its affiliates shall cause the Southern Entities to (A) take all steps as are or may be reasonably necessary, including without limitation the filing of elections or returns with applicable Taxing Authorities, to cause such period to end on the Closing Date or (B) if clause (A) is inapplicable, report the operations of the Southern Entities only for that portion of such period ending on the Closing Date in a combined, consolidated, or unitary Tax Return filed by the Parent, the Stock Sellers or an affiliate, notwithstanding that such taxable period does not end on the Closing Date. (d) The Purchaser's Tax Returns for Periods After the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall prepare and file or cause the Southern Entities to prepare and file all Tax Returns with respect to the Southern Entities for which the Parent is not responsible pursuant to Section 4.12(c). Subject to Section 4.12(g)(i), the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid any and all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns that are attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall provide to the Parent drafts of all Tax Returns described in the second preceding sentence required to be prepared and filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Parent pursuant to Section 4.12(e) or Section 4.12(g)(i), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules, at least 30 calendar days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including extensions) or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely filing of any such Tax Return. At least 15 calendar days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including extensions), or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely filing of such Tax Return, the Parent shall notify the Purchaser of the existence of any objection (specifying in 55
reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection) the Parent may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Returns (a "Dispute Notice"). The Purchaser and the Parent agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. If Tax Returns are not prepared and provided in accordance with this Section 4.12(d), the Parent shall not be liable for the subject Taxes to the extent that the Parent has been materially prejudiced by the Purchaser's breach. The Purchaser shall not file any Tax Return subject to this Section 4.12(d) without the prior written consent of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no such consent shall be required if the Parent shall not have timely delivered a Dispute Notice or the objections contained in such Dispute Notice shall have been finally resolved. (e) Apportionment of Taxes. All Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the income, property or operations of the Southern Entities that relate to a Straddle Tax Period shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income, receipts, capital or net worth, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, which shall be governed by Section 4.11(d)(ii) and Section 4.12(h)), such Taxes apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Tax year ended with the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis other than those described in clause (i), including but not limited to property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations, such Taxes shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Tax Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. Any deferred items taken into income by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19 as a result of this transaction shall for these purposes be apportioned to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Section 4.12(h) shall control the allocation of the Taxes thereunder. The Parent and its affiliates shall be liable for the payment of all Taxes of the Southern Entities which are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, whether shown on any original Tax Return or amended Tax Return for the period referred to therein. The Purchaser shall be liable for the payment of all Taxes which are attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period. All transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Purchaser's purchase of the Southern Entity Shares (other than the Section 338(h)(10) Elections) shall be reported on the Purchaser's federal Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-1(d). (f) Controversies. The Purchaser shall notify the Parent in writing within 30 calendar days of the receipt by the Purchaser or any affiliate of the 56
Purchaser (including the Southern Entities after the Closing Date) of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes for which the Parent may be liable under Section 4.12(g)(i) (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax Matter"). The Parent, at its own expense, shall have the exclusive authority to represent the interests of the Southern Entities with respect to any Tax Matter before the Internal Revenue Service, any other Taxing Authority, any other governmental agency or authority or any court and shall have the sole right to extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect to a Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and settling audits or lawsuits; provided, however, that the Parent shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter that affects or may affect the Tax liability of the Purchaser or the Southern Entities for any Post-Closing Tax Period, including any Straddle Tax Period, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parent shall keep the Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter. The Parent shall, in good faith, allow the Purchaser or the Purchaser's counsel to consult with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding. If the proceeding affects or may affect the Tax liability of the Purchaser or the Southern Entities for any Post-Closing Tax Period including any Straddle Tax Period, the Parent shall further allow the Purchaser and the Purchaser's counsel to participate in the proceeding. Unless otherwise provided by the Parent in writing to the Purchaser, all notices required by this Section 4.12(f) shall be sent to: J. C. Penney Company, Inc., 6501 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024, Attention: Vice President and Director of Taxes. (g) Tax Indemnification. (i) The Parent shall indemnify the Purchaser, CVS and their affiliates and, after the Closing, each of the Southern Entities from and against (A) any Taxes and Damages resulting from, arising out of, relating to or caused by any liability or obligation of the Purchaser or any Southern Entity for Taxes of any person other than the Purchaser or the Southern Entities (w) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (x) as a transferee or successor, (y) by contract, or (z) otherwise, (B) any increase in foreign, federal, state or local Taxes attributable to the deemed sale of assets resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections or as a consequence of Section 338 of the Code as applied by any state, local or foreign jurisdiction, (C) any breach of any covenant in this Section 4.12, (D) any Taxes imposed on any Southern Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (E) any breach of representation contained in Section 2.02(q)(xii). The Parent's obligation to indemnify the Purchaser with respect to any Taxes resulting from a Tax Matter shall be discharged to the extent that the Parent's defense of such Tax Matter has been materially prejudiced by the Purchaser's failure to comply with Section 4.12(f) of this Agreement. The Parent shall discharge its obligation to indemnify the Purchaser against such Pre- 57
Closing Tax Period Taxes by paying to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount of such Taxes; provided, however, that if the Purchaser provides the Parent with written notice of Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes at least 30 calendar days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid by the Purchaser or the applicable Southern Entities, the Parent shall, if and to the extent that it is liable for such Taxes hereunder, discharge its obligation to indemnify the Purchaser against such Taxes by paying an amount equal to the amount of such Taxes to the relevant Taxing Authority. The Parent shall provide the Purchaser evidence of such payment to the relevant Taxing Authority. Any payment required to be made under this paragraph shall be made not later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of written notice that any such Tax has been incurred. (ii) The Purchaser shall indemnify the Parent from and against (A) any Taxes and Damages imposed on the Purchaser, the Southern Entities or any affiliate of the Purchaser for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (B) any Taxes and Damages for any Post-Closing Tax Period imposed on (x) the Parent attributable to the Southern Entities or (y) the Southern Entities, (C) Taxes and Damages arising from a transaction not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Purchaser's purchase of the Shares other than the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and (D) any breach of any covenant in this Section 4.12. The Purchaser shall discharge its obligation to indemnify the Parent against such Tax under this Section 4.12(g)(ii) by paying to the Parent an amount equal to the amount of such Tax; provided, however, that if the Parent provides the Purchaser with written notice of a Tax under this Section 4.12(g)(ii) at least 30 calendar days prior to the date on which the relevant Tax is required to be paid by the Parent, the Purchaser shall, if and to the extent that it is liable for such Taxes hereunder, discharge its obligation to indemnify the Parent against such Tax by paying an amount equal to the amount of such Tax to the relevant Taxing Authority. The Purchaser shall provide the Parent evidence of such payment to the relevant Taxing Authority. Any payment required to be made under this paragraph shall be made not later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of written notice that any such Tax has been incurred. (h) Transfer Taxes. The Parent and the Purchaser shall equally share liability for all Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the purchase of the Southern Entity Shares as set forth in Section 4.11(d). (i) Refunds; Carrybacks. The Purchaser may, at its option, cause the Southern Entities to elect, where permitted by applicable law, to carry forward any Tax attribute carryover that would, absent such election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Parent any Tax refunds or credits, including those received as a result of the carry back of a net operating or capital loss arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period, attributable 58
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received or credited to the Purchaser or the Southern Entities, net of any direct costs attributable to receipt of such refund or credit, including Taxes payable with respect to such refund, within 30 calendar days after the receipt of such refund or credit. At the Parent's request, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Parent in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims as prepared by the Parent, at the Parent's expense, provided that there is no adverse impact on the Purchaser or the Southern Entities in any Post-Closing Tax Period. All refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period received by the Purchaser or the Southern Entities shall be for the benefit of the Purchaser. (j) Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Purchaser and the Parent shall join with each other in making a timely, irrevocable and effective election provided by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(c) (the "Federal Section 338(h)(10) Election"), and, if permissible, similar elections under applicable state and local Tax Laws with respect to the Purchaser's purchase of the Southern Entity Shares (collectively with the Federal Section 338(h)(10) Election, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). (k) Allocation of Aggregate Deemed Sales Price. No later than 60 calendar days after the finalization of the valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Parent pro forma Forms 8883 and the supporting documentation. The pro forma Forms 8883 shall set forth an allocation of the aggregate deemed sales price, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4 (but without regard to either party's transaction costs). The Parent shall have the right to review such forms solely for the purpose of determining whether the allocation has been made in accordance with the final valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert delivered pursuant to Section 4.11(e). If, within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the pro forma forms, the Parent notifies the Purchaser that the Parent objects to the pro forma forms on the basis that they do not reflect the valuation of the Independent Valuation Expert, then the Parent and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement within the 15 calendar days following the Parent's notification of Purchaser of such disagreement and the pro forma forms shall be amended before filing to reflect any such resolution. Within 15 calendar days after the later of (i) the date on which the Purchaser and the Parent shall have resolved any objections or (ii) the failure of the Parent to notify the Purchaser of an objection within 15 calendar days each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its final Forms 8883. Section 4.13. Employee Matters. (a) Employees and Offers of Employment. (i) Prior to the date hereof, the Parent has caused the Sellers and the Southern Entities to have provided to the Purchaser a schedule that 59
sets forth the names, as of March 5, 2004, of all Southern Business Employees, organized by Southern Site. Such schedule shall be updated as necessary to reflect new hires or other personnel changes occurring between the date hereof and the Closing Date. In addition, prior to the date hereof, the Parent has caused the Sellers and the Southern Entities to have provided to the Purchaser a schedule of all Southern Business Employees, organized by Southern Site, including the following information for each Southern Business Employee (to the extent such information is contained in the HR Data Records maintained by Hewitt Associates for the Sellers): home address, home telephone number, birth date, social security number, job title or position pay rate and full-time/part-time status. The foregoing information will be updated as necessary to reflect new hires or other personnel changes occurring between the date hereof and the Closing Date. In addition, Parent will cause the Sellers to provide to the Purchaser, on or before the Closing Date, the following additional information with respect to each Southern Business Employee to the extent such information is contained in the HR Data Records maintained by Hewitt Associates for the Sellers: birth date, job title or position effective date, race, gender, last pay increase date, continuous service date, all paid time off eligibility and balances, status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, benefit eligibility and enrollment status (including defined contribution plan information), federal and state tax information, credit union information, and all miscellaneous deduction information. (ii) On the Closing Date, Purchaser or one of its affiliates shall offer employment to all Southern Business Employees (set forth on the schedule described in the first sentence of Section 4.13(a)(i) as the same has been updated from time to time prior to the Closing Date); provided, that the Purchaser or its affiliates may terminate at any time after the Closing Date the employment of any employee who accepts such offer. For purposes of this Section 4.13(a), the term "Southern Business Employee" shall include any Person who, on the Closing Date, is on short-term disability leave, authorized leave of absence, military service or lay-off with recall rights as of the Closing Date; provided, that such inactive employees shall be offered employment by the Purchaser or its affiliates as of the date they return to active employment but only if such employee returns to active service within 26 weeks after the Closing Date or such later time as their reemployment rights are protected by applicable Laws. Any such offers of employment shall be at such salary or wage and benefit levels that are comparable to the salary or wage and benefit levels offered to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser and its affiliates; provided, however, that during any post-Closing transition services period during which Transferred Employees (as defined below) continue to participate in any Benefit Plans, the Purchaser or its affiliates may provide that Transferred Employees (as defined below) shall continue to be covered at the benefit levels provided to such employees under such 60
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. The employees who accept and commence employment with the Purchaser or its affiliates are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Transferred Employees". The Parent will not take any action which would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with the Purchaser's or its affiliates' effort to hire any Southern Business Employees. Neither the Purchaser nor its affiliates shall assume responsibility for any Transferred Employee until such employee commences employment with the Purchaser or its affiliates. In addition, if any Southern Business Employee suffers a termination of employment without cause during the 12 month period beginning on the Closing Date, the Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, provide such employee with severance benefits, in an amount at least equal to the benefits provided under any severance or separation pay plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy maintained by the Sellers or any TDI Company or TDI Subsidiary and disclosed on Section 2.02(q) of the Disclosure Schedule (calculated based on such Southern Business Employee's salary or wage and benefit level immediately preceding his or her termination of employment). (iii) With respect to whole and partial vacation days that have been earned but unused by Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date (the "Unused Vacation"), to the extent not paid at Closing, the Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, either (A) permit each Transferred Employee to use the Unused Vacation after the Closing Date over the same period that the Transferred Employee could have used the Unused Vacation under the vacation policy of the TDI Companies or the TDI Subsidiaries, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) pay the Unused Vacation to the Transferred Employee. In addition, in the event any Transferred Employee terminates employment with the Purchaser and its affiliates prior to either using the Unused Vacation or receiving pay in lieu of the Unused Vacation, the Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, pay any remaining Unused Vacation to the Transferred Employee upon termination of employment. (b) Employee and Benefit Liabilities. (i) Except for benefits accrued under funded or fully insured Company Plans, and except as provided in Section 4.13(b)(ii), Section 4.13(b)(iii) and Section 4.13(b)(iv), the Purchaser or its affiliates shall assume and be solely responsible for all obligations and liabilities of each Seller and each Seller's Subsidiary in respect of any current Southern Business Employee (and their beneficiaries), including, without limitation incentives, retention and vacation benefit liabilities, that arise or are incurred before (to the extent set forth on the Balance Sheet), on or after the Closing Date, other than any obligations, liabilities or responsibilities under any employment agreement with any such Southern Business Employee. It is not intended that a Southern Business Employee who 61
rejects an offer of employment from Purchaser or one of its affiliates made in accordance with Section 4.13(a)(ii) shall be entitled to any severance benefits. However, if any such Southern Business Employee is entitled to any severance benefits, the Parent shall be solely responsible for such benefits. The Parent will retain and be solely responsible for all obligations and liabilities with respect to any former Southern Business Employee and any Southern Business Employee who rejects an offer of employment from Purchaser.

Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, cover as of the Closing each Transferred Employee, enrolled in a Seller group health plan or a Southern Entities group health plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, under a group health plan and waive any preexisting condition limitations applicable to such Transferred Employees under any group health plan made available to them, and Purchaser will, or will cause one of its affiliates to, take all action necessary to ensure that such Transferred Employees are given full credit for all co-payments and deductibles incurred under any group health plan of a Seller or a Seller's Subsidiary for the plan year that includes the Closing Date. (ii) With respect to each Transferred Employee who participates in the Eckerd 401(k) Savings Plan and who, pursuant to an 62
elective transfer within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A 3(b), elects to transfer his or her vested account balance in such Plan to a defined contribution plan of Purchaser or one of its affiliates, Eckerd will cause the trustee of the Eckerd 401(k) Savings Plan to transfer to the trustee of the defined contribution plan of Purchaser or its affiliate the account balance of such Transferred Employee, and Purchaser will cause the trustee of such defined contribution plan to accept such transfer; provided that this sub-paragraph (ii) shall not apply to (A) any account balance to which Code Sections 401(a)(11) or 417 apply or (B) any account balance that, at the time of transfer, is invested in Parent's company stock fund. (d) No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Section 4.13 shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Sellers or of any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with either the Purchaser or any of its affiliates and no provision of this Section 4.13 shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or any plan or arrangement which may be established by the Purchaser or any of its affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate after the Closing Date any such plans or arrangements of CVS or any of its affiliates. Section 4.14. Guarantee Releases under Certain Contracts. The Purchaser will make good faith efforts to procure the release by the applicable counterparty of any guarantee of the Parent or its affiliates in place with respect to any third party vendor or supplier contract by offering a replacement guarantee of CVS or its affiliates, but Purchaser will have no further obligation to procure such release. Section 4.15. Contractual Overpayments. If at any time in the eighteen (18) month period following the Closing Date, the Purchaser or any of its affiliates receives a refund amount or a reduction in an amount payable from a vendor that relates to a contractual overpayment under any of the Assigned Contracts, the Split Contracts or the Southern Site Leases by the Sellers in the period prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall turn over such refunded amount or an amount equal to the reduction, as the case may be, to the Parent. Section 4.16. Framework Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and the Stock Purchaser shall enter into the Framework Agreement pursuant to which the Purchaser and the Stock Purchaser shall determine which assets and liabilities of the Sellers and the Business that relate to both the Northern Business and the Southern Business will be transferred to or assumed by the Purchaser and the Stock Purchaser, and the Parent shall not have any liability for the Stock Purchaser's or the Purchaser's failure to comply with the provisions of the Framework Agreement. 63

Sponsor Agreement dated January 31, 1997 between TDI Managed Care Services, Inc. and Parent Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (the "VEBA Agreement") as amended by Addendum No. 1 effective as of January 1, 2002. In addition, after the Closing Date, the Parent shall not, and shall cause its affiliates (at the time of such change of control) not to, exercise any right to terminate the VEBA Agreement by virtue of a change of control of the PBM Entity unless a third party or group (other than Purchaser, its affiliates or investors in a public offering or public distribution) acquire control of the PBM Entity. Section 4.18. Title and Survey. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Parent shall (a) provide or make available to the Purchaser copies of the existing as-built surveys (the "Existing Surveys") of the Owned Real Property and of such of the Leased Real Property as are used for distribution centers in any Southern State (the "Designated Leased Property"), and which are, in any such instance, in Parent's or Sellers' possession, (b) request an update or recertification of the Existing Surveys in favor of Purchaser and in accordance with Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys, as adopted by the American Land Title Association and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping or the local equivalent (the "New Surveys"), and (c) cause Parent's or Sellers' title insurance company to provide to the Purchaser a commitment for Owner's Title Policies or Leasehold Title Policies, as applicable (collectively, the "Title Policies"), covering each parcel of Owned Real Property or Designated Leased Property (collectively, the "Commitments"), together with the documents evidencing all exceptions and restrictions shown on the Commitments (the "Title Documents"). The updates or recertifications of the Existing Surveys and the cost of the base premiums for the Title Policies shall be at the Parent's or Sellers' sole cost and expense. The cost of any modifications and endorsements to the Title Policies and/or the cost of any mortgagee policies of title insurance that may be required by any lender of the Purchaser, including any modifications and endorsements to such mortgagee policies of title insurance, shall be at the Purchaser's sole cost and expense. Within twenty (20) calendar days after the date Purchaser receives the last of the Title Documents and New Survey for each parcel of Owned Real Property and Designated Leased Property, Purchaser may deliver to Seller a statement in writing of any objections Purchaser may have to Sellers' fee title to a parcel of Owned Real Property or leasehold title to Designated Leased Property, as the case may be, other than Permitted Liens and the standard printed exclusions from coverage contained in the Title Policies (collectively, "Title Objections"). Any Title Objections shall be deemed waived if Parent or the Sellers are not notified of such Title Objections within twenty (20) calendar days after Purchaser receives the last of the Title Documents and New Survey for the applicable parcel of Owned Real Property or Designated Leased Property or within ten (10) calendar days after Seller receives any subsequent amendment or endorsement to the Title Documents or New Survey for the applicable parcel of Owned Real Property or 64
Designated Leased Property. Sellers shall not be required to bring any action or proceeding or otherwise incur any cost or expense to cure any Title Objections raised by Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, except that Sellers shall be required to (i) satisfy any mortgages placed upon any parcel of Owned Real Property as a lien to secure indebtedness incurred by Parent or Sellers, (ii) satisfy any mortgages placed upon any parcel of Designated Leased Property as a lien to secure indebtedness incurred by Parent or Sellers, (iii) cause the release of or bond over any mechanic's liens placed upon any parcel of Owned Real Property or Designated Leased Property by a third party in connection with work performed or alleged to have been performed on such parcel of Owned Real Property or Designated Leased Property on behalf of Parent or Sellers (unless placed upon the Owned Real Property or Designated Leased Property on behalf of Purchaser), and (iv) cause the release of any judgment or tax lien. Section 4.19. Environmental Inspections. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not conduct any environmental inspections, investigations or testing on the Real Property without the Sellers' prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld but which shall be subject to the receipt by the Sellers of any required landlord consents, if required pursuant to the applicable Southern Site Leases). Any inspections, investigations or testing shall be conducted at the sole expense of the Purchaser and in accordance with all applicable laws. The Sellers shall have the right to have a representative present during any inspections of the Real Property. The Purchaser may request any and all publicly available information about the Real Property from Governmental Entities but will not disclose prior to the Closing Date to any Governmental Entity the results of any pre-Closing inspection, sampling or testing conducted at any of the Real Property, whether performed by a Seller, the Purchaser, a consultant or agent thereof or otherwise, without the Sellers' prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), except to the extent required by Law. (b) Purchaser will, or will cause its consultants or agents to, promptly pay when due the costs of all inspections and examinations done with regard to the Real Property and promptly restore the Real Property to the condition in which such Real Property existed prior to any inspection or examination. (c) Purchaser shall keep all of the Real Property free and clear of all Liens or Encumbrances caused by Purchaser or any of its consultants or any agents prior to the Closing Date in connection with such environmental inspection or examination and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers and/or the Parent Indemnitees (as defined in Section 7.02) from and against any Damages suffered by Sellers and/or the Parent Indemnitees arising out of any entry upon the Real Property and any inspections or examinations conducted by Purchaser, its consultants or agents, on the Real Property prior to Closing. The indemnity provisions of this Section 4.19(c) shall survive Closing and any termination of this Agreement and shall not be subject to any limitation of liability set forth in this Agreement. 65
Section 4.20. Prorations. At the Closing, with respect to the Southern Site Leases (and, as applicable, with respect to the Owned Real Property), all rent (including without limitation percentage rent), common area charges, utility charges, real estate taxes, and other obligations shall be prorated as of the Closing Date (collectively the "Prorated Charges"). Whenever possible, such prorations shall be based on actual, current payments by the Sellers and to the extent such actual amounts are not available, such prorations shall be estimated as of the Closing Date based on actual amounts for the most recent comparable billing period. When the actual amounts become known, such prorations shall be recalculated by the Purchaser and the Parent and the Purchaser or the Parent shall make any additional payment or refund, as the case may be, so that the correct prorated amount is paid by each of the Purchaser and the Parent. The foregoing shall include an estimate of a pro rata amount of percentage rent payable under a Southern Site Lease based upon the prior year's sales with an appropriate adjustment to be made not later than the date that the Purchaser is obligated to pay such percentage rent, based on actual sales. The Seller's actual prorated share of rent based on actual sales shall be determined by multiplying (a) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the applicable Seller's gross annual sales at such Southern Site from the first day of such lease year to (but not including) the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the sum of the Purchaser's and the applicable Seller's gross annual sales at such Southern Site for the entire lease year, times (b) the amount of percentage rent actually due under the Southern Site Lease for such lease year. The applicable Seller, upon the request of the Purchaser, shall promptly provide the Purchaser such information as the Purchaser shall be required to submit to landlords under the Southern Site Lease in connection with the payment of percentage rent with respect to the Southern Site. Section 4.21. Medicare And Medicaid Provider Numbers. The Purchaser shall promptly make (and thereafter diligently pursue) all filings, notifications and applications required for participating as a provider in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement programs with respect to the Southern Business. If the Purchaser has not obtained the required Medicaid and/or Medicare provider numbers ("Provider Numbers") by Closing, then the use of such numbers by the Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall be as provided in the Management Agreement. Section 4.22. Non-solicitation. The Parent agrees that, until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly through another Person, (a) solicit to hire or hire, or (b) encourage, entice or induce to terminate an employment relationship of or with (i) any employee of the Southern Business at the district manager level or above or (ii) any person who was at the district manager level or above in the Southern Business within the six months preceding such solicitation or hiring. The foregoing restrictions are not intended to preclude general solicitations in newspapers or similar mass media not targeted toward employees of the Southern Business. 66

As promptly as practicable and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each fiscal month ending after the date hereof and before the Closing Date, the Parent and the Sellers will deliver to the Purchaser copies of monthly profit and loss statements with respect to each individual Southern Store, the PBM Business, the Mail Order Business and the Specialty Pharmacy Business and a consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows for the Business that are prepared by the Sellers and delivered to its executive officers in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.01, any Real Property that is owned or leased by any of the Southern Entities and that primarily relates to the Northern Business shall be transferred prior to Closing to one of the entities that the Stock Purchaser is acquiring pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Section 4.26. Insurance Claims Administration. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be responsible for claims administration under general liability policies for occurrences arising in or from the Southern Business prior to Closing, to the extent such policies continue after Closing to provide coverage for such pre-Closing occurrences. The Parent and the Purchaser shall negotiate the Insurance Assignment Agreement in good faith and shall use their reasonable efforts to agree on the form, substance and obligation amount thereof prior to the Closing. If the Sellers receive any insurance proceeds with respect to an Assumed Liability, the Sellers shall turn over such proceeds (or the allocable portion of such proceeds) to the Purchaser. Section 4.27. Controlled Substances Inventory. To the extent required by applicable Law or DEA regulations in context of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers will undertake and deliver to the Purchaser at each Southern Site, an inventory of "controlled substances" located at such Southern Site, as close as practicable prior to the Closing. Section 4.28. JCP Telemarketing Agreement. On or prior to the Closing Date, Thrift Drug, Inc. will assign its rights, and delegate its obligations under, the Inbound/Outbound Services Agreement dated effective January 1, 1992 between J.C. Penney Telemarketing, Inc. and Thrift Drug, Inc. to the PBM Entity, and the termination notice period therein shall be amended to be 90 days. All other terms of that agreement shall remain the same as in the copy of the contract provided to the Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement. 67
Section 4.29. Sharing of Net Real Estate Costs in CN States.

Purchaser will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of such terminations and dispositions. Each party will seek in good faith to mitigate the Aggregate CN Net Real Estate Liability. Section 1.13 shall not apply to CN Real Estate Interests. Section 4.30. EDC Licensing, Inc. Except as otherwise provided in the Framework Agreement or the Eckerd Transition Services Agreement, the Parent shall cause EDC Licensing, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to transfer the Intellectual Property Rights it holds that are associated solely with the Southern Business to a Southern Entity.

Investor Contact: Nancy Christal Media Contact: Todd Andrews Vice President Director Investor Relations Corporate Communications (914) 722-4704 (401) 770-5717 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- CVS CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE 1,260 ECKERD STORES AND PBM/MAIL ORDER PHARMACY BUSINESS IN $2.15 BILLION TRANSACTION WILL CREATE AMERICA'S LEADING PHARMACY RETAILER WITH MORE THAN 5,000 STORES IN 36 STATES, AND A $2 BILLION PBM/MAIL ORDER PHARMACY BUSINESS SERVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MILLION LIVES, WITH COMBINED 2003 REVENUES OF $33 BILLION TRANSACTION EXPECTED TO BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN 2005 AND BEYOND WOONSOCKET, RI, April 5, 2004 - CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire from J.C. Penney Company, Inc., approximately 1,260 Eckerd drug stores, located mainly in the southern United States; Eckerd Health Services, which includes Eckerd's $1 billion mail order and pharmacy benefits management businesses; and three Eckerd distribution centers. The cash transaction is valued at $2.15 billion. Following completion of the transaction, CVS will be America's leading pharmacy retailer with more than 5,000 locations in 36 states and the District of Columbia. CVS' PharmaCare subsidiary will nearly double in size to more than $2 billion in annual revenues and will serve approximately 30 million lives. In total, CVS will fill approximately 13% of the nation's retail prescriptions. The combined 2003 revenues of CVS Corporation and the operations it has agreed to acquire were approximately $33 billion. The majority of the stores CVS will acquire are located in Florida and Texas, while others are located in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arizona, Missouri, Kansas and Alabama. The distribution centers being acquired are located near Dallas and Houston, Texas and Orlando, Florida. Tom Ryan, Chairman, President and CEO of CVS Corporation, said: "This acquisition is a unique opportunity and is consistent with our long-term strategy of expanding our store base in the high-growth sun-belt markets. The demographics in these states are very favorable, as they are experiencing rapid population growth, particularly among seniors, resulting in pharmaceutical utilization rates among the highest in the nation.
2 "The addition of Eckerd Health Services to our PharmaCare subsidiary creates a national mail order, pharmacy benefits management and specialty pharmacy company with annual revenues in excess of $2 billion and approximately 30 million lives served. We believe we can drive further growth through the combination of its outstanding operations with those of PharmaCare. Moreover, with increased scale, PharmaCare will be in a better position to serve large corporate customers. "CVS' track record of significantly improving the performance of acquired operations will serve us well as we seek to improve the Eckerd stores we are acquiring. The portfolio is fundamentally sound, with valuable real estate and associates. We believe that the stores will benefit considerably from our leading-edge technology and expertise in important areas such as merchandising, logistics, customer service and marketing. We will pursue a wide range of initiatives designed to improve the stores' focus on inventory management, market-oriented pricing and building customer loyalty through our ExtraCare program. We are confident that our success in these areas will lead to enhanced sales growth, margin expansion and increased profitability at the acquired operations," Mr. Ryan concluded. CVS expects that its enhanced market position in the South will enable it to achieve annual cost synergies through economies of scale in advertising, distribution and purchasing, as well as other SG&A efficiencies. The Company's enhanced presence in the South will also strengthen service to current customers who travel south from other markets by enabling them to utilize CVS for their pharmacy needs throughout the year. Dave Rickard, Chief Financial Officer, said: "The purchase price is very attractive on a purely cash economics basis and the transaction will provide significant long-term strategic benefits. The purchase price represents a multiple of 0.30x net sales acquired. In addition, we expect the transaction to add approximately $150 million to our cash flow in 2005, even after a significant infusion of capital for stores and systems." Mr. Rickard continued: "We expect this acquisition to be 12 to 15 cents dilutive to 2004 earnings per share, after integration and non-recurring expenses associated with the transaction. We expect the transaction to be 15 to 20 cents accretive to 2005 earnings per share and to be 25 to 30 cents accretive to 2006 earnings per share." CVS expects to finance the transaction with a combination of short- and long-term debt. Closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in June of 2004, is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as well as customary closing conditions. CVS will be holding a conference call today for the investment community at 9:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss this transaction. The call will be simulcast on the Company's Web site for all interested parties. To access the webcast, visit the Company's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.CVS.com to hear the call live, or to listen to an archive of the call which will be available for a one-week period following the call.
