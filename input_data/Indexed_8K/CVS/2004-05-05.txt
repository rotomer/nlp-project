WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, May 5, 2004 - CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced sales and earnings for the first quarter ended April 3, 2004.
 
Net sales for the first quarter ended April 3, 2004 increased 8.0% to $6.82 billion, up from $6.31 billion during the first quarter of 2003. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 6.4%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 8.3% and front-end same store sales increased 2.0%. Total pharmacy sales represented 70.3% of total company sales for the quarter. Third party prescription sales were 93.6% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter increased 24.6% to $244.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $196.3 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003.
 
"I am very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect healthy sales growth in both our pharmacy and front-end businesses, and significant gross margin improvement," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Corporation. "The improvement in our gross margin was driven by an increase in generic drug sales, a continued decrease in inventory losses, and a more profitable promotional product mix. By any financial measure, this was a terrific quarter," concluded Mr. Ryan.
 
For the first quarter, CVS opened 29 new stores, closed 21 and relocated 17 others. As of April 3, 2004, CVS operated 4,187 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia.

The transaction is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as well as other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in June of 2004.
