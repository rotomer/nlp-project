Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
        On July 31, 2004, CVS Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. completed the acquisition of approximately 1,260 Eckerd drugstores (located mainly in the southern United States, including Texas and Florida), three distribution centers, as well as Eckerd's pharmacy benefits management and mail order businesses (collectively, the "Southern Business") from J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including Eckerd Corporation. CVS intends to continue the Southern Business.
        The acquisition of the drugstores and distribution centers is structured as an asset purchase, while the acquisition of the pharmacy benefit management and mail order businesses is structured as a stock purchase under the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of April 4, 2004. The purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement is $2.15 billion which is subject to adjustment based on the working capital of the Southern Business as of closing. CVS obtained funding for the acquisition through a combination of cash and commercial paper and it expects to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowing with longer term financing during the third quarter of 2004.

Immediately after making each Revolving Credit Loan and after giving effect to all Competitive Bid Loans repaid on the same date, the Aggregate Credit Exposure will not exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount. With respect to each Lender, at the time of the making of any Revolving Credit Loan, the sum of (I) the principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loan constituting a part of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made and (II) the aggregate principal balance of all other Revolving Credit Loans (exclusive of Revolving Credit Loans which are repaid with the proceeds of, and simultaneously with the incidence of, the Revolving Credit Loans to be made) then outstanding from such Lender will not exceed the Commitment of such Lender at such time. At the option of the Borrower, indicated in a Borrowing Request, Revolving Credit Loans may be made as ABR Advances or Eurodollar Advances. (b) The aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Credit Loans shall be due and payable on the Commitment Termination Date or on such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6. 2.2 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 2.3 NOTICE OF BORROWING REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS The Borrower agrees to notify the Administrative Agent, which notification shall be irrevocable, no later than (a) 10:00 A.M. on the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of Revolving Credit Loans to consist of ABR Advances and (b) 10:00 A.M. at least two Eurodollar Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of Revolving Credit Loans to consist of Eurodollar Advances. Each such notice shall specify (i) the aggregate amount requested to be borrowed under the Commitments, (ii) the proposed Borrowing Date, (iii) whether a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans is to be of ABR Advances or Eurodollar Advances, and the amount of each thereof and (iv) the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Advances. Each such notice shall be promptly confirmed by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Request.

Each ABR Advance made on each Borrowing Date shall equal no less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notification to be confirmed by fax or other writing) of each such Borrowing 16

In order to request Competitive Bids, the Borrower shall deliver by hand or fax to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid Request not later than 11:00 A.M., one Domestic Business Day before the proposed Borrowing Date therefor. A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit F may be rejected by the Administrative Agent in the Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of such rejection by fax and telephone. Each Competitive Bid Request shall specify (x) the proposed Borrowing Date for the Competitive Bid Loans then being requested (which shall be a Domestic Business Day) and the aggregate principal amount thereof and (y) the Competitive Interest Period or Interest Periods (which shall not exceed ten different Interest Periods in a single Competitive Bid Request), with respect thereto (which may not end after the Domestic Business Day immediately preceding the Commitment Termination Date). Promptly after its receipt of each Competitive Bid Request that is not rejected as aforesaid, the Administrative Agent shall invite by fax (in the form of Exhibit G) the Lenders to bid, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to such Competitive Bid Request. (b) Each Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, may make one or more Competitive Bids to the Borrower responsive to a Competitive Bid Request.

If any Lender shall elect not to make a Competitive Bid, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent by fax not later than 10:00 A.M. on the proposed Borrowing Date therefor, PROVIDED that the failure by any Lender to give any such notice shall not obligate such Lender to make any Competitive Bid Loan in connection with the relevant Competitive Bid Request. 17
(c) With respect to each Competitive Bid Request, the Administrative Agent shall (i) notify the Borrower by fax by 11:00 A.M. on the proposed Borrowing Date with respect thereto of each Competitive Bid made, the Competitive Bid Rate applicable thereto and the identity of the Lender that made such Competitive Bid, and (ii) send a list of all Competitive Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as practicable after completion of the bidding process.

In connection with each acceptance of one or more Competitive Bids by the Borrower: (1) the Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the Borrower has decided to reject a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate unless the acceptance of such lower Competitive Bid would subject the Borrower to any requirement to withhold any taxes or deduct any amount from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents, in which case the Borrower may reject such lower Competitive Bid, (2) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request therefor, (3) if the Borrower shall desire to accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate, it must accept all other Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, except for any such Competitive Bid the acceptance of which would subject the Borrower to any requirement to withhold any taxes or deduct any amount from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents, PROVIDED that if the acceptance of all such other Competitive Bids would cause the aggregate amount of all such accepted Competitive Bids to exceed the amount requested, then such acceptance shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid at such Competitive Bid Rate, (4) except pursuant to clause (3) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted unless the Competitive Bid Loan with respect thereto shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (5) no Competitive Bid shall be accepted and no Competitive Bid Loan shall be made, if immediately after giving effect thereto, the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount. 18

Any such payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to its rights against such Lender. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Loans for purposes of this Agreement, which Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender on the Borrowing Date applicable to such Loans. 3.2 PAYMENTS (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans by the Borrower from the Lenders, any Conversion of Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to another, and any reduction in the Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the Commitment Percentage of each Lender. Each payment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on the Loans and of the Facility Fee and the Utilization Fee (collectively, together with all of the other fees to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents, the "FEES"), and of all of the other amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 11.2 without setoff, deduction or counterclaim in funds immediately available in New York by 3:00 P.M. on the due date for such payment. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, PROVIDED that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on 21
amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the: (i) Revolving Credit Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders and (ii) Competitive Bid Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each applicable Lender. Each payment of the Fees payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Commitment Amount or, if the Commitments shall have terminated or been terminated, according to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans. (b) If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period or Competitive Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Facility Fee and the Utilization Fee) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension. 3.3 CONVERSIONS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to an ABR Advance by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Domestic Business Day's prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted. In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Interest Period relating thereto, PROVIDED that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, PROVIDED that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 22
(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance. The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6). (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document: (i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.3 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Revolving Credit Loans or expiration of an Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Revolving Credit Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3, (ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6, and (iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances and Competitive Bid Loans, in the aggregate, outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances or Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to a single Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request, as the case may be, shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan for the purpose of calculating such limitation. 3.4 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES (a) PRIOR TO MATURITY. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), the Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates per annum set forth below: 23
Revolving Credit Loans Eurodollar Rate applicable thereto PLUS the constituting Eurodollar Applicable Margin. Advances Competitive Bid Loans Fixed rate of interest applicable thereto
(b) AFTER MATURITY, LATE PAYMENT RATE. After maturity, whether by acceleration, notice of intention to prepay or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum until paid (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). Any payment of principal, interest or any Fees not paid on the date when due and payable shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum from the due date thereof until the date such payment is made (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). (c) HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with the Fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an "UNQUALIFIED AMOUNT"), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a "COMPENSATORY INTEREST PAYMENT") equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts LESS all other Compensatory Interest Payments. (d) GENERAL. Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Commitment Termination Date and, to the extent provided in Section 2.7(b), upon each prepayment of the Loans. Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the BNY Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate, the Eurodollar Rate and the Competitive Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the 24
Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the BNY Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the BNY Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 3.5 INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSS Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.3 or 3.3, as the case may be, (ii) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Competitive Bid Loan after it shall have accepted any offer with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.4, (iii) a Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iv) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (v) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.7, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith. 3.6 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS, ETC. If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on such Lender's capital or the capital of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling such Lender (each a "CONTROL PERSON"), or (B) the asset value (for capital purposes) to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account such Lender's or such Control Person's policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), (iii) will subject such Lender 25
or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement or any Note, or (iv) will change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of principal, interest or fees payable under the Loan Documents (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, for any tax or changes in the rate of tax on such Lender's or such Control Person's net income) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively, "COSTS") attributable to such Lender's or such Control Person's compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change. Each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice). 3.7 ILLEGALITY OF FUNDING Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment. 26
3.8 OPTION TO FUND; SUBSTITUTED INTEREST RATE (a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Eurodollar Advance or a Competitive Bid Loan, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or its Competitive Bid Loan during the Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Eurodollar Advance and Competitive Bid Loan in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its Commitment Percentage of each Eurodollar Advance or its Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, during the applicable Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or the amount of such Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, and having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10. (b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an "AFFECTED ADVANCE"), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans). Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof) 27
Affected Advances, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances. 3.9 CERTIFICATES OF PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT Each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 3.10 TAXES; NET PAYMENTS (a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, PROVIDED that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to each Lender. If any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, such Lender shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to such Lender) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender in any respect. In the event that any Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit applicable to the payments made by the Borrower in respect of such Lender under this Section. 28
(b) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrower is liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required by the Internal Revenue Code. 3.11 FEES (a) FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the "FACILITY FEE") during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date shall have occurred, and on the Expiration Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of (a) prior to the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6, the Commitment Amount of such Lender (whether used or unused), and (b) thereafter, the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Facility Fee shall be payable upon demand. In addition, upon each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount of such reduction through the date of such reduction. The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. (b) UTILIZATION FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the "UTILIZATION FEE") for each day during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date (or, if later, the date when the Committed Credit Exposure of such Lender is $0) that the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure plus the Aggregate Credit Exposure (as defined in the Other Credit Agreement) on such date exceeds 50% of the sum of the Aggregate Commitment Amount plus the Aggregate Commitment Amount (as defined in the Other Credit Agreement) on such date, payable on each Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest Payment Date applicable solely to Competitive Bid Loans), at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of the Committed Credit Exposure of such Lender on such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Utilization Fee shall be payable upon demand. The Utilization Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 29
3.12 REPLACEMENT OF LENDER If the Borrower is obligated to pay to any Lender any amount under Section 3.6 or 3.10, the Borrower shall have the right within 90 days thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.7(b), if no Default or Event of Default shall exist, to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED LENDER") with one or more other assignees (each a "REPLACEMENT LENDER"), PROVIDED that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Acceptance Agreements pursuant to Section 11.7(b) (with the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b) payable pursuant to said Section 11.7(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment and the outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay the following: (a) to the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and (B) an amount equal to all accrued, but unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender and (b) to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to all amounts owed by such Replaced Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, a corresponding amount of which was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1 and which has not been repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Replaced Lender or the Borrower, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 3.12, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement that are intended to survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of the Loans. 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders: 4.1 EXISTENCE AND POWER Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in such good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect), has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 30
4.2 AUTHORITY The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower. 4.3 BINDING AGREEMENT The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy. 4.4 LITIGATION There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 4.5 NO CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS (a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents. (b) No provision of any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement or of any existing statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the 31
Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement. 4.6 TAXES The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with respect to all federal, state, local and other taxes are considered by the management of the Borrower to be adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (b) is or might be due and payable against it or any Subsidiary or any Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP or which have been assessed but are not yet due and payable. 4.7 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS; FILINGS Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all Governmental Authorities, a violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed with all Governmental Authorities all reports, applications, documents, instruments and information required to be filed pursuant to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requests which, if not so filed, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 4.8 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary nor any corporation controlling the Borrower or any Subsidiary or under common control with the Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to any statute or regulation which regulates the incurrence of Indebtedness. 4.9 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS; USE OF PROCEEDS The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the 32

In the event that the Administrative Agent shall fail or refuse so to proceed, each Lender shall be entitled to take such action as the Required Lenders shall deem appropriate to enforce its rights under the Loan Documents. 10. AGENT 10.1 APPOINTMENT Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints BNY as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under the Loan Documents and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 10.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith upon the advice of such counsel. 45
10.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS None of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or such Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents (except the Administrative Agent for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any party contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, the Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Loan Documents or for any failure of the Borrower or any other Person to perform its obligations thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire into the observance or performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan Documents, or to inspect the Property, books or records of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility to the Borrower or any other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance, or any breach, by any Lender of any of its obligations under any of the Loan Documents. The Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted under the Loan Documents unless the Administrative Agent shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. 10.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, request, consent, certificate, affidavit, opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of the Loan Documents or any instrument, document or communication furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action not expressly required under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or, if required by Section 11.1, all Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Borrower, all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes. 46
10.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice thereof from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, PROVIDED that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action or give such directions, or refrain from taking such action or giving such directions, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Lenders. 10.6 NON-RELIANCE Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that such Lender has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, evaluations and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that a copy of this Agreement and all exhibits and schedules hereto have been made available to it and its individual counsel for review, and each Lender acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance thereof. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 47
10.7 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 10.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BNY and each Affiliate thereof, may make loans to, accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as though it were not the Administrative Agent. With respect to the Commitment made or renewed by BNY and each Note issued to BNY (if any), BNY shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" shall include BNY. 10.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT If at any time the Administrative Agent deems it advisable, in its sole discretion, it may submit to each Lender a written notification of its resignation as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, such resignation to be effective on the earlier to occur of (a) the thirtieth day after the date of such notice, and (b) the date upon which any successor to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, shall have accepted in writing its appointment as successor Administrative Agent. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall automatically become a party to this Agreement and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent's rights, powers, privileges and duties as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Borrower and the Lenders shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting Administrative Agent, upon notice duly given, the Borrower agrees to make each payment when due under the Loan Documents directly to the Lenders entitled thereto during such time. 10.10 CO-SYNDICATION AGENTS AND DOCUMENTATION AGENT The Co-Syndication Agents and the Documentation Agent shall have no duties or obligations under the Loan Documents in their capacities as Co-Syndication Agents or Documentation Agent, respectively. 48
11. OTHER PROVISIONS 11.1 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may, from time to time, enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications of the Loan Documents and, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may execute and deliver to any such parties a written instrument waiving or consenting to the departure from, on such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of the Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences, PROVIDED that no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall (i) increase the Commitment Amount of any Lender without the consent of such Lender (PROVIDED that no waiver of a Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to constitute such an increase), (ii) extend the Commitment Period without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment, of the Fees without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) reduce the rate, or extend the time of payment of, interest on any Revolving Credit Loan or any Note (other than the applicability of any post-default increase in such rate of interest) without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (v) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment of any payment of principal on any Revolving Credit Loan or any Note without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vi) decrease or forgive the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan or any Note without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vii) consent to any assignment or delegation by the Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the consent of each Lender, (viii) change the provisions of this Section 11.1 without the consent of each Lender, (ix) change the definition of Required Lenders without the consent of each Lender, (x) change the several nature of the obligations of the Lenders without the consent of each Lender, or (xi) change the sharing provisions among Lenders without the consent of each Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall (A) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 or otherwise change any of the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document without the written consent of the Administrative Agent or (B) change the amount or the time of payment of any Competitive Bid Loan or interest thereon without the written consent of the Lender holding such Competitive Bid Loan. Any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the parties to the applicable Loan Document, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans and the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights under the Loan Documents, but any Default or Event of Default waived shall not extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 11.2 NOTICES Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile, as follows: 49

The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. 11.6 LENDING OFFICES Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to time to transfer any Loan to a different office of such Lender, subject to Section 3.10. 11.7 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (a) The provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each Credit Party) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of any Loan Document. (b) Any Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the applicable Loans at the time owing to it), to an Eligible Assignee, PROVIDED that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall be for a pro rata portion of such Lender's Commitment and such Lender's then outstanding Revolving Loans, (iii) no assignments to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted (and any attempted assignment or transfer to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be null and void), (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement together with, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall 52
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire, and PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this subsection shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10 and 11.10). Except as otherwise provided under clause (iii) of this subsection, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under the Loan Documents that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of the Loan Documents as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (e) of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error, and the Borrower and each Credit Party may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Credit Party, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by subsection (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this subsection. (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or any Credit Party, sell participations to Eligible Assignees (each a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and outstanding Loans owing to it), PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Loan Parties and the Credit Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents and (iv) no participations to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted (and any attempted 53
participation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be null and void). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Documents, PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 11.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.8 as though it were a Lender, PROVIDED that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.10(c) as though it were a Lender. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.7 or 3.10 than the Lender that sold the participation to such Participant would have been entitled to receive with respect to the interest in the Loan Documents subject to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.10 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.10(b) as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to an Eligible SPC the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement, PROVIDED that (i) such designation shall not be effective unless the Borrower consents thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any Eligible SPC to fund any Loan, and (iii) if an Eligible SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The funding of a Loan by an Eligible SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender. As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each Eligible SPC shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement and otherwise, PROVIDED that (x) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Granting Lender and (y) its Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such Granting Lender's obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Loans or portion thereof made by it. Each Granting Lender shall act as administrative agent for 54
its Eligible SPC and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any Eligible SPC shall be paid to its Granting Lender as administrative agent for such Eligible SPC and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Granting Lender's application of such payments. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no Eligible SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Eligible SPC may (i) at any time, subject to payment of the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b), assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Lender (but nothing contained herein shall be construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder) or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such Eligible SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such Eligible SPC. This Section may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loans is being funded by an Eligible SPC at the time of such amendment. 11.8 COUNTERPARTS Each of the Loan Documents (other than the Notes) may be executed on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be charged. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all of the parties hereto shall be lodged with each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Any party to a Loan Document may rely upon the signatures of any other party thereto which are transmitted by fax or other electronic means to the same extent as if originally signed. 11.9 SET-OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS (a) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) or (b) or upon the acceleration of the Loans, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness or other liability, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to such Lender arising under the Loan Documents, any amount owing from such Lender to the Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance of, service upon such Lender of, or notice to such Lender of, any petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, 55
appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after each such set-off and application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. (b) If any Lender (each a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of its Loans or its Notes in excess of its pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans) of payments then due and payable on account of the Loans and Notes received by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase, without recourse, for cash, from the other Lenders such participations in their Loans and Notes as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment with each of them according to their pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans), PROVIDED that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's pro rata share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may exercise such rights to payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 11.10 INDEMNITY (a) The Borrower shall indemnify each Credit Party and each Related Party thereof (each such Person being called an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against, and hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnified Person, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Person arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any other transactions contemplated thereby (including the Eckerd Acquisition), (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto, PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower shall have no 56
liability under clause (i) of this Section to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses relating to income or withholding taxes or any tax in lieu of such taxes. (b) To the extent that the Borrower fails to promptly pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under subsection (a) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the product of such unpaid amount MULTIPLIED BY (i) at any time when no Loans are outstanding, its Commitment Percentage, or if no Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage on the last day on which Commitments did exist, and (ii) at any time when Loans are outstanding (x) if the Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage or (y) if the Commitments have been terminated or otherwise no longer exist, the percentage equal to the fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of such Lender's Credit Exposure and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure (in each case determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. (c) The obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders under this Section 11.10 shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct and actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Loan Document or any agreement, instrument or other document contemplated thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. 11.11 GOVERNING LAW The Loan Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 11.12 SEVERABILITY Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. 11.13 INTEGRATION All exhibits to the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a part thereof. Each Loan Document embodies the entire agreement and understanding between or among the parties thereto 57
with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. 11.14 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees to maintain as confidential and not to disclose, publish or disseminate to any third parties any financial or other information relating to the business, operations and condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower provided to it, except if and to the extent that: (a) such information is in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (b) such information is required to be disclosed by subpoena or similar process or applicable law or regulations; (c) such information is required or requested to be disclosed to any regulatory or administrative body or commission to whose jurisdiction it may be subject; (d) such information is disclosed to its counsel, auditors or other professional advisors; (e) such information is disclosed to (and, unless and until it receives written objection from the Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to disclosure of such information to) its affiliates (and its affiliates' officers, directors and employees), PROVIDED that such information shall be used in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (f) such information is disclosed to its officers, directors and employees; (g) such information is disclosed with the prior written consent of the party furnishing the information; (h) such information is disclosed in connection with any litigation or dispute involving the Borrower and/or it; (i) such information is disclosed in connection with the sale of a participation or other disposition by it of any of its interest in this Agreement, PROVIDED that such information shall not be disclosed unless and until the party to whom it shall be disclosed shall have agreed to keep such information confidential as set forth herein; (j) such information was in its possession or in its affiliate's possession as shown by clear and convincing evidence prior to any of the Borrower and/or any or the Borrower's representatives or agents furnishing such information to it; or (k) such information is received by it, without restriction as to its disclosure or use, from a Person who, to its knowledge or reasonable belief, was not prohibited from disclosing such information by any duty of confidentiality. 58
Except to the extent prohibited or restricted by law or Governmental Authority, each Lender shall notify the Borrower promptly of any disclosures of information made by it as permitted pursuant to (h) above. 11.15 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Borrower acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, (b) by virtue of the Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship to the Borrower, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and (c) by virtue of the Loan Documents, no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders. 11.16 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION The Borrower irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal Court sitting in the City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court, after all appropriate appeals, shall be conclusive and binding upon it. 11.17 SERVICE OF PROCESS The Borrower agrees that process may be served against it in any suit, action or proceeding referred to in Section 11.16 by sending the same by first class mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier service, with receipt acknowledged, to the address of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.2. The Borrower agrees that any such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the fullest extent enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. 11.18 NO LIMITATION ON SERVICE OR SUIT Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification, waiver, or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions. 11.19 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS 59
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

CVS CORPORATION By: ----------------------------- Name: --------------------------- Title: --------------------------
364 DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT EXHIBIT D-1 FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE BORROWER June 11, 2004 The Lenders, the Co-Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent Referred to Below c/o The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent One Wall Street New York, New York 10286 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am general counsel of CVS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER"), and have acted as such in connection with the 364 Day Credit Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004, by and among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse First Boston and Wachovia Securities, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Documentation Agent, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering my opinions set forth below, I have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto (other than the Borrower) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted.
2. The Borrower is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower. 4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and Notes do not require any action or approval on the part of the shareholders of the Borrower or any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (i) United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or (iii) any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 5. The Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity. 6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" (as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended). 7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. To the best of my knowledge, there are no proceedings pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document or (b) which could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 8. To the best of my knowledge, the Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 2
9. To the best of my knowledge, no provision of any judgment, decree or order, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications: (a) I express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) in which any Lender is located which may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect. (b) I express no opinion as to provisions in the Credit Agreement which purport to create rights of set-off in favor of participants or which provide for set-off to be made otherwise than in accordance with applicable laws. (c) I note that public policy considerations or court decisions may limit the rights of any party to obtain indemnification under the Credit Agreement. I am a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal law of the United States of America and the Delaware General Corporation Law. For purposes of paragraph 5 of this opinion, I have assumed that, with your permission and without any research or investigation, the laws of the State of New York are identical to the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without my prior written consent, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion as if it were specifically addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof. Very truly yours, 3

In addition, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments, and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law, as we have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
-2- June 11, 2004 Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that (i) the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement (x) require no consent or other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under New York State law, and (y) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of New York State law or regulation that in our experience is normally applicable to general business corporations in relation to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement. The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications and assumptions: (a) Our opinions are subject to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability, and the enforceability of indemnification provisions may be limited by Federal or State laws or policies underlying such laws. (b) As to various provisions in the Credit Agreement that grant the Administrative Agent or the Lenders certain rights to make determinations or take actions in their discretion, we assume that such discretion will be exercised in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. (c) We express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Lender is located that may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect. (d) We express no opinion as to the effect of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar provisions of State law. (e) We have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation, that (i) the Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action, and (iii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement (x) require no consent or other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law and (y) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (a) United States federal law or regulation or the Delaware
-3- June 11, 2004 General Corporation Law, or (b) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company. We are members of the bar of the State of New York and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (other than an assignee permitted under Section 11.7 of the Credit Agreement) without our prior written consent. Very truly yours,

Swing Line Loans (i) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (ii) shall not, immediately after giving effect thereto, result in the Aggregate Credit Exposure exceeding the Aggregate Commitment Amount, and (iii) shall not, immediately after giving effect thereto, result in the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Swing Line Loans exceeding the Swing Line Commitment. The Swing Line Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan at a time when any Lender shall be in default of its obligations under this Agreement unless the Swing Line Lender has entered into arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lender's risk with respect to such defaulting Lender's participation in such Swing Line Loan. The Swing Line Lender will not make a Swing Line Loan if the Administrative Agent, or any Lender by notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Borrower no later than one Domestic Business Day prior to the Borrowing Date with respect to such Swing Line Loan, shall have determined that the conditions set forth in Sections 5 and/or 6, as applicable, have not been satisfied and such conditions remain unsatisfied as of the requested time of the making of such Loan.

The proceeds of each Mandatory Borrowing shall be remitted directly to the Swing Line Lender to repay such outstanding Swing Line Loan. Each Lender irrevocably agrees to make a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing by the Swing Line Lender notwithstanding: (i) whether the amount of such Mandatory Borrowing complies with the minimum amount for Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any condition specified in Section 6 is then unsatisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) the Borrowing Date of such Mandatory Borrowing, (v) the aggregate principal amount of all Loans then outstanding, (vi) the Aggregate Credit Exposure at such time and (vii) the amount of the Commitments at such time.

Each Lender shall also be liable for an amount equal to the product of its Commitment Percentage and any amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section that are subsequently rescinded or avoided, or must otherwise be restored or returned. Such liabilities shall be unconditional and without regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or the compliance by the Borrower with any of its obligations under the Loan Documents.

The Administrative Agent shall deliver the payments made by each Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the Swing Line Lender promptly upon receipt thereof in like funds as received. Each Lender hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs and expenses resulting from any failure on the part of such Lender to pay, or from any delay in paying, the Administrative Agent any amount such Lender is required by notice from the Administrative Agent to pay in accordance with this Section (except in respect of 19
losses, liabilities or other obligations suffered by the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be), and such Lender shall pay interest to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender from the date such amount was due until paid in full, on the unpaid portion thereof, at a rate of interest per annum, whether before or after judgment, equal to (i) from the date such amount was due until the third day therefrom, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and (ii) thereafter, the Federal Funds Effective Rate PLUS 2%, payable upon demand by the Swing Line Lender.

If any Lender shall elect not to make a Competitive Bid, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent by fax not later than 10:00 A.M. on the proposed Borrowing Date therefor, PROVIDED that the failure by any Lender to give any such notice shall not obligate such Lender to make any Competitive Bid Loan in connection with the relevant Competitive Bid Request.

In connection with each acceptance of one or more Competitive Bids by the Borrower: (1) the Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the Borrower has decided to reject a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate unless the acceptance of such lower Competitive Bid would subject the Borrower to any requirement to withhold any taxes or deduct any amount from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents, in which case the Borrower may reject such lower Competitive Bid, (2) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request therefor, (3) if the Borrower shall desire to accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate, it must accept all other Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, except for any such Competitive Bid the acceptance of which would subject the Borrower to any requirement to withhold any taxes or deduct any amount from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents, PROVIDED that if the acceptance of all such other Competitive Bids would cause the aggregate amount of all such accepted Competitive Bids to exceed the amount requested, then such acceptance shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid at such Competitive Bid Rate, (4) except pursuant to clause (3) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted unless the Competitive Bid Loan with respect thereto shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (5) no Competitive Bid shall be accepted and no Competitive Bid Loan shall be made, if immediately after giving effect thereto, the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount.

(g) All notices required by this Section shall be given in accordance with Section 11.2. 2.5 USE OF PROCEEDS The Borrower agrees that the proceeds of the Loans and Letters of Credit shall be used solely for its general corporate purposes not inconsistent with the provisions hereof, including as a backup for commercial paper issued by the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the Borrower further agrees that no part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used, directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately (i) for a purpose which violates any law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority, including the provisions of Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended or any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 4.9 and (ii) to make a loan to any director or executive officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 2.6 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS (a) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTIONS. At the Borrower's option and upon at least three Domestic Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may (i) terminate the Commitments, the Swing Line Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment, at any time, or (ii) permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Swing Line Commitment or the Letter of Credit Commitment, in part at any time and from time to time, PROVIDED that (1) each such partial reduction shall be in an amount equal to at least (A) in the case of the Aggregate Commitment Amount $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (B) in the case of the Swing Line Commitment, $1,000,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (C) in the case of the Letter of Credit Commitment, $1,000,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (2) immediately after giving effect to each such reduction, (A) the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall equal or exceed the Aggregate Credit Exposure, (B) the Swing Line Commitment shall equal or exceed the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Swing Line Loans and (C) the Letter of Credit Commitment shall equal or exceed the Letter of Credit Exposure of all Lenders, and PROVIDED FURTHER that a notice of termination of the Commitments, the Swing Line Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities (such notice to specify the proposed effective date), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied and the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. 23
(b) IN GENERAL. Each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be made by reducing each Lender's Commitment Amount by a sum equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such reduction. 2.7 PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS (a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may prepay Revolving Credit Loans, Competitive Bid Loans and Swing Line Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, but subject to Section 3.5 at any time and from time to time, by notifying the Administrative Agent, which notification shall be irrevocable, at least two Eurodollar Business Days, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Advances, two Domestic Business Days, in the case of Competitive Bid Loans, or one Domestic Business Day, in the case of a prepayment of Swing Line Loans and ABR Advances, prior to the proposed prepayment date specifying (i) the Loans to be prepaid, (ii) the amount to be prepaid, and (iii) the date of prepayment. Upon receipt of each such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each such notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, PROVIDED that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments, the Swing Line Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment as contemplated by Section 2.6, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.6, and the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. Each partial prepayment under this Section shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of ABR Advances and Swing Line Loans) or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 ($100,000 in the case of ABR Advances and Swing Line Loans) in excess thereof. (b) IN GENERAL. Simultaneously with each prepayment hereunder, the Borrower shall prepay all accrued interest on the amount prepaid through the date of prepayment and indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. 2.8 LETTER OF CREDIT SUB-FACILITY (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and the payment by the Borrower to the Issuer of such fees as the Borrower and the Issuer shall have agreed in writing, the Issuer agrees, in reliance on the agreement of the other Lenders set forth in Section 2.9, to issue standby letters of credit (each a "LETTER OF CREDIT" and, collectively, the "LETTERS OF CREDIT") during the Commitment Period for the account of the Borrower, PROVIDED that immediately after the issuance of each Letter of Credit (i) the Letter of Credit Exposure of all Lenders shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment, and (ii) the Aggregate Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount. Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date which shall be not later than the earlier to occur of one year from the date of issuance thereof or 5 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date. No Letter of Credit shall be issued if the Administrative Agent, or any Lender by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Issuer no later than 3:00 P.M. one Domestic Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter of Credit, shall have determined that the conditions set forth in Sections 5 and/or 6, as applicable have not been satisfied. 24
(b) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued for the account of the Borrower in support of an obligation of the Borrower in favor of a beneficiary who has requested the Issuance of such Letter of Credit as a condition to a transaction entered into in connection with the Borrower's ordinary course of business. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a Letter of Credit Request for the issuance of each Letter of Credit by 12:00 Noon at least two Domestic Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance. Such Letter of Credit Request shall be accompanied by the Issuer's standard Application and Agreement for Standby Letter of Credit (each a "REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT") executed by the Borrower, and shall specify (i) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and the obligations of the Borrower in respect of which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, (ii) the Borrower's proposal as to the conditions under which a drawing may be made under such Letter of Credit and the documentation to be required in respect thereof, (iii) the maximum amount to be available under such Letter of Credit, and (iv) the requested date of issuance. Upon receipt of such Letter of Credit Request from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer and each other Lender thereof. The Issuer shall, on the proposed date of issuance and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer, with such provisions with respect to the conditions under which a drawing may be made thereunder and the documentation required in respect of such drawing as the Issuer shall reasonably require. Each Letter of Credit shall be used solely for the purposes described therein. (c) Each payment by the Issuer of a draft drawn under a Letter of Credit shall give rise to the obligation of the Borrower to immediately reimburse the Issuer for the amount thereof. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower of such payment by the Issuer of a draft drawn under a Letter of Credit, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to make reimbursement when due. In lieu of such notice, if the Borrower has not made reimbursement prior to the end of the Domestic Business Day when due, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Issuer to deduct the amount of any such reimbursement from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Issuer, upon which the Issuer shall apply the amount of such deduction to such reimbursement. If all or any portion of any reimbursement obligation in respect of a Letter of Credit shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity thereof, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable upon demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Margin applicable to ABR Advances PLUS 2%, from the date of such nonpayment until paid in full (whether before or after the entry of a judgment thereon). 2.9 LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATION (a) Each Lender hereby unconditionally and irrevocably, severally (and not jointly) takes an undivided participating interest in the obligations of the Issuer under and in connection with each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such Letter of Credit. Each Lender shall be liable to the Issuer for its Commitment Percentage of the unreimbursed amount of any draft drawn and honored under each Letter of Credit. Each Lender shall also be liable for an amount equal to the product of its Commitment Percentage and any amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.8 and 2.10 that are subsequently rescinded or avoided, or must otherwise be restored or returned. Such 25
liabilities shall be unconditional and without regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or the compliance by the Borrower with any of its obligations under the Loan Documents. (b) The Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender (which notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing), of the date and the amount of each draft paid under each Letter of Credit with respect to which full reimbursement payment shall not have been made by the Borrower as provided in Section 2.8(c), and forthwith upon receipt of such notice, such Lender shall promptly make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuer its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such unreimbursed draft at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in Section 11.2 in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the payments made by each Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the Issuer promptly upon receipt thereof in like funds as received. Each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Issuer from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) resulting from any failure on the part of such Lender to provide, or from any delay in providing, the Administrative Agent with such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of any payment made by the Issuer under a Letter of Credit in accordance with this clause (b) above (except in respect of losses, liabilities or other obligations suffered by the Administrative Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be, resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be). If a Lender does not make available to the Administrative Agent when due such Lender's Commitment Percentage of any unreimbursed payment made by the Issuer under a Letter of Credit, such Lender shall be required to pay interest to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuer on such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such payment at a rate of interest per annum equal to (i) from the date such Lender should have made such amount available until the third day therefrom, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and (ii) thereafter, the Federal Funds Effective Rate PLUS 2%, in each case payable upon demand by the Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such interest payments to the Issuer upon receipt thereof in like funds as received. (c) Whenever the Administrative Agent is reimbursed by the Borrower, for the account of the Issuer, for any payment under a Letter of Credit and such payment relates to an amount previously paid by a Lender in respect of its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment under such Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent (or the Issuer, if such payment by a Lender was paid by the Administrative Agent to the Issuer) will promptly pay over such payment to such Lender. 2.10 ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS The Borrower's obligation to reimburse the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuer for each payment under or in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the beneficiary of such Letter 26
of Credit, the Administrative Agent, the Issuer, the Swing Line Lender, any Lender or any other Person, including, without limitation, any defense based on the failure of any drawing to conform to the terms of such Letter of Credit, any drawing document proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid, or the legality, validity, regularity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, PROVIDED that, with respect to any Letter of Credit, the foregoing shall not relieve the Issuer of any liability it may have to the Borrower for any actual damages sustained by the Borrower arising from a wrongful payment (or failure to pay) under such Letter of Credit made as a result of the Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct. 2.11 NOTES Any Lender may request that the Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Person or, if requested by such Person, such Person and its registered assigns. Thereafter, all Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.7) be represented by a Note in like form payable to the order of the payee named therein and its registered assigns. 3. PROCEEDS, PAYMENTS, CONVERSIONS, INTEREST, YIELD PROTECTION AND FEES 3.1 DISBURSEMENT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOANS The Administrative Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Loans (other than the Swing Line Loans) at its office specified in Section 11.2 by crediting to the Borrower's general deposit account with the Administrative Agent the funds received from each Lender. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received prior notice from a Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notice to be confirmed by fax or other writing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans, or the amount of any Competitive Bid Loan, to be made by it on a Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in accordance with this Section, PROVIDED that, in the case of a Revolving Credit Loan, such Lender received notice thereof from the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand, such corresponding amount (to the extent not previously paid by the other), together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of the Borrower, the applicable interest rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) and, in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date such payment is due until the third day after such date and, thereafter, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate PLUS 2%. Any such payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to its rights against such Lender. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such 27
Lender's Loan as part of such Loans for purposes of this Agreement, which Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender on the Borrowing Date applicable to such Loans. 3.2 PAYMENTS (a) Each payment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on the Loans and of the Facility Fee, the Utilization Fee and the Letter of Credit Participation Fee (collectively, together with all of the other fees to be paid to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuer and the Swing Line Lender in connection with the Loan Documents, the "FEES"), and of all of the other amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 11.2 without setoff, deduction or counterclaim in funds immediately available in New York by 3:00 P.M. on the due date for such payment. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, PROVIDED that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the: (i) Revolving Credit Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders, (ii) Competitive Bid Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each applicable Lender and (iii) Swing Line Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to the Swing Line Lender. Each payment of the Fees payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Commitment Amount or, if the Commitments shall have terminated or been terminated, according to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans. (b) If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period or Competitive Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Facility Fee, the Utilization Fee and the Letter of Credit Participation Fee) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension. 3.3 CONVERSIONS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to an ABR Advance by giving the Administrative Agent at least 28
one Domestic Business Day's prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted. In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Interest Period relating thereto, PROVIDED that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, PROVIDED that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance. The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6). (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document: (i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.3 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Revolving Credit Loans or expiration of an Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Revolving Credit Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3, (ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6, and 29
(iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances and Competitive Bid Loans, in the aggregate, outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances or Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to a single Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request, as the case may be, shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan for the purpose of calculating such limitation. 3.4 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES (a) PRIOR TO MATURITY. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), the Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates per annum set forth below: (b) AFTER MATURITY, LATE PAYMENT RATE. After maturity, whether by acceleration, notice of intention to prepay or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum until paid (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). Any payment of principal, interest or any Fees not paid on the date when due and payable shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum from the due date thereof until the date such payment is made (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). (c) HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with the Fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an "UNQUALIFIED AMOUNT"), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent 30
period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a "COMPENSATORY INTEREST PAYMENT") equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts LESS all other Compensatory Interest Payments. (d) GENERAL. Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Commitment Termination Date and, to the extent provided in Section 2.7(b), upon each prepayment of the Loans. Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the BNY Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate, the Eurodollar Rate and the Competitive Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the BNY Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the BNY Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 3.5 INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSS Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.3 or 3.3, as the case may be, (ii) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Competitive Bid Loan after it shall have accepted any offer with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.4 or a Swing Line Loan after it shall have agreed to a Negotiated Rate with respect thereto in accordance with Section 2.2(a), (iii) a Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (other than the termination of a Swing Line Loan resulting from a Mandatory Borrowing at a time when no Default or Event of Default shall exist), (iv) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (other than the repayment or prepayment of a Swing Line Loan resulting from a Mandatory Borrowing at a time when no Default or Event of Default shall exist), or (v) the Borrower shall have revoked a 31
notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments, the Swing Line Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.7, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be, or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be, and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith. 3.6 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS, ETC. If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and the Issuer or any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on the Issuer's or such Lender's capital or the capital of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling the Issuer or such Lender (each a "CONTROL PERSON"), or (B) the asset value (for capital purposes) to the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of the Reimbursement Obligations, or any participation therein, or the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account the Issuer's, such Lender's or such Control Person's policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), (iii) will subject the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement, any Note, or any Reimbursement Agreement, or (iv) will change the basis of taxation of payments to the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of principal, interest or fees payable under the Loan Documents (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, for any tax or changes in the rate of tax on the Issuer's, such Lender's or such Control Person's net income) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by the Issuer or such Lender, as applicable, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuer, such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively, "COSTS") attributable to the Issuer's, such Lender's or such Control Person's compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change. The Issuer and each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the 32
case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice). 3.7 ILLEGALITY OF FUNDING Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment. 3.8 OPTION TO FUND; SUBSTITUTED INTEREST RATE (a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Swing Line Loan, a Eurodollar Advance or a Competitive Bid Loan, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or its Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan during the Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Swing Line Loan, Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. The Swing Line Lender and each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Swing Line Loan, Eurodollar Advance and Competitive Bid Loan in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its Commitment Percentage of each Eurodollar Advance or its Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, during the applicable Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or the amount of such Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, and having a maturity corresponding to such 33
Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10. (b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an "AFFECTED ADVANCE"), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans). Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof) Affected Advances, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances. 3.9 CERTIFICATES OF PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT Each Issuer and each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by the Issuer and each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 34
3.10 TAXES; NET PAYMENTS (a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuer and the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Issuer and the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, PROVIDED that the Lenders, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to the Issuer and each Lender. If any payment to the Issuer or any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, in any respect. In the event that the Issuer or any Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section, the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit applicable to the payments made by the Borrower in respect of the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, under this Section. (b) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrower is liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required by the Internal Revenue Code. 35
3.11 FEES (a) FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the "FACILITY FEE") during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date shall have occurred, and on the Expiration Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of (a) prior to the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6, the Commitment Amount of such Lender (whether used or unused), and (b) thereafter, the sum of (i) the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender, (ii) such Lender's Swing Line Exposure and (iii) such Lender's Letter of Credit Exposure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Facility Fee shall be payable upon demand. In addition, upon each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount of such reduction through the date of such reduction. The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. (b) UTILIZATION FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the "UTILIZATION FEE") for each day during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date (or, if later, the date when the Committed Credit Exposure of such Lender is $0) that the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure plus the Aggregate Credit Exposure (as defined in the Other Credit Agreement) on such date exceeds 50% of the sum of the Aggregate Commitment Amount plus the Aggregate Commitment Amount (as defined in the Other Credit Agreement) on such date, payable on each Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest Payment Date applicable solely to Competitive Bid Loans) or if Letters of Credit are outstanding, but no Revolving Credit Loans or Swing Line Loans are outstanding, payable on each date that the Letter of Credit Participation Fee is payable, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of the Committed Credit Exposure of such Lender on such date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Utilization Fee shall be payable upon demand. The Utilization Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 3.12 LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATION FEE The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the "LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATION FEE") with respect to the Letters of Credit during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Commitment Termination Date or, if later, the date when the Letter of Credit Exposure of all Lenders is $0, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date shall have occurred, and on the last date of such period, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of the average daily aggregate amount which may be drawn under the Letters of Credit during such period (whether or not the conditions for drawing thereunder have or may be satisfied) multiplied by such Lender's 36
Commitment Percentage. The Letter of Credit Participation Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 3.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDER If the Borrower is obligated to pay to any Lender any amount under Section 3.6 or 3.10, the Borrower shall have the right within 90 days thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.7(b), if no Default or Event of Default shall exist, to replace such Lender (the "REPLACED LENDER") with one or more other assignees (each a "REPLACEMENT LENDER"), reasonably acceptable to the Swing Line Lender and the Issuer, PROVIDED that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Acceptance Agreements pursuant to Section 11.7(b) (with the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b) payable pursuant to said Section 11.7(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment, the outstanding Loans, the Swing Line Exposure and the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay the following: (a) to the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans and Swing Line Participation Amounts of the Replaced Lender, (B) an amount equal to all drawings on all Letters of Credit that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time, and (C) an amount equal to all accrued, but unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender, (b) to the Issuer, an amount equal to such Replaced Lender's Commitment Percentage of all drawings (which at such time remain unpaid drawings) to the extent such amount was not funded by such Replaced Lender, (c) to the Swing Line Lender, an amount equal to such Replaced Lender's Commitment Percentage of any Mandatory Borrowing to the extent such amount was not funded by such Replaced Lender, and (d) to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to all amounts owed by such Replaced Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, a corresponding amount of which was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1 and which has not been repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Replaced Lender or the Borrower, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 3.13, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement that are intended to survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of the Loans. 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES In order to induce the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuer to enter into this Agreement, the Lenders to make the Loans and the Issuer to issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuer: 37
4.1 EXISTENCE AND POWER Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in such good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect), has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 4.2 AUTHORITY The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower. 4.3 BINDING AGREEMENT The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy. 4.4 LITIGATION There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 38
4.5 NO CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS (a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents. (b) No provision of any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement or of any existing statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement. 4.6 TAXES The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with respect to all federal, state, local and other taxes are considered by the management of the Borrower to be adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (b) is or might be due and payable against it or any Subsidiary or any Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP or which have been assessed but are not yet due and payable. 4.7 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS; FILINGS Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all Governmental Authorities, a violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed with all Governmental Authorities all reports, applications, documents, instruments and information required to be filed pursuant to all applicable 39
laws, rules, regulations and requests which, if not so filed, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 4.8 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary nor any corporation controlling the Borrower or any Subsidiary or under common control with the Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to any statute or regulation which regulates the incurrence of Indebtedness. 4.9 FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS; USE OF PROCEEDS The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit has been or will be used, directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for a purpose which violates any law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the Issuer nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to or on behalf of the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable law, regulation or statute, including said Regulation U. Following application of the proceeds of each Loan and the issuance of each Letter of Credit, not more than 25% (or such greater or lesser percentage as is provided in the exclusions from the definition of "Indirectly Secured" contained in said Regulation U as in effect at the time of the making of such Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit) of the value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis that are subject to Section 8.2 will be Margin Stock. In addition, no part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to make a loan to any director or executive officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 4.10 NO MISREPRESENTATION No representation or warranty contained in any Loan Document and no certificate or written report furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to any Loan Document contains or will contain, as of its date, a misstatement of material fact, or omits or will omit to state, as of its date, a material fact required to be stated in order to make the statements therein contained not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which made (it being understood that the Borrower makes no representation or warranty hereunder with respect to any projections or other forward looking information). 4.11 PLANS Each Employee Benefit Plan of the Borrower, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate is in compliance with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, where applicable, except where the failure to so comply would not be material. The Borrower, each Subsidiary and each 40
ERISA Affiliate have complied with the material requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Pension Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, except where the failure to so comply would not be material. The Borrower, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has, as of the date hereof, made all contributions or payments to or under each Pension Plan required by law or the terms of such Pension Plan or any contract or agreement. No liability to the PBGC has been, or is reasonably expected by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to be, incurred by the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate. Liability, as referred to in this Section 4.11, includes any joint and several liability, but excludes any current or, to the extent it represents future liability in the ordinary course, any future liability for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is a group health plan within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is in material compliance with the continuation of health care coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code and with the portability, nondiscrimination and other requirements of Sections 9801, 9802, 9803, 9811 and 9812 of the Internal Revenue Code. 4.12 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary (a) has received written notice or otherwise learned of any claim, demand, action, event, condition, report or investigation indicating or concerning any potential or actual liability which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, arising in connection with (i) any non-compliance with or violation of the requirements of any applicable federal, state or local environmental health or safety statute or regulation, or (ii) the release or threatened release of any toxic or hazardous waste, substance or constituent, or other substance into the environment, (b) to the best knowledge of the Borrower, has any threatened or actual liability in connection with the release or threatened release of any toxic or hazardous waste, substance or constituent, or other substance into the environment which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, (c) has received notice of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a release or threatened release of any toxic or hazardous waste, substance or constituent or other substance into the environment for which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is or would be liable, which liability would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (d) has received notice that the Borrower or any Subsidiary is or may be liable to any Person under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 ET SEQ., or any analogous state law, which liability would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of federal and state environmental laws to the extent applicable, including those contained in 40 C.F.R., parts 264 and 265, subpart H, and any analogous state law, except in those cases in which the failure so to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 4.13 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Lenders through the Administrative Agent copies of (i) the audited Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of January 3, 2004, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for the fiscal year then ended, and (ii) the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet of 41
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of April 3, 2004, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for the fiscal quarter then ended.

The Financial Statements fairly present the Consolidated financial condition and results of the operations of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods indicated therein and, except as noted therein, have been prepared in conformity with GAAP as then in effect. Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability of any kind (whether fixed, accrued, contingent, unmatured or otherwise) which, in accordance with GAAP as then in effect, should have been disclosed in the Financial Statements and was not. During the period from January 3, 2004 to and including the Effective Date there has been no Material Adverse change, including as a result of any change in law, in the consolidated financial condition, operations, business or Property of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 5.

The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire into the observance or performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan 53
Documents, or to inspect the Property, books or records of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility to the Borrower or any other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance, or any breach, by any Lender of any of its obligations under any of the Loan Documents. The Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted under the Loan Documents unless the Administrative Agent shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. 10.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, request, consent, certificate, affidavit, opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of the Loan Documents or any instrument, document or communication furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action not expressly required under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or, if required by Section 11.1, all Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Borrower, all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes. 10.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice thereof from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, PROVIDED that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action or give such directions, or refrain from taking such action or giving such directions, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Lenders. 54

Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that such Lender has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, evaluations and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that a copy of this Agreement and all exhibits and schedules hereto have been made available to it and its individual counsel for review, and each Lender acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance thereof. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 10.7 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 10.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BNY and each Affiliate thereof, may make loans to, accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as though it were not the Administrative Agent. With respect to the Commitment made or renewed by BNY and each Note issued to BNY (if any), BNY shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, and the term "Lender" shall include BNY. 10.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT If at any time the Administrative Agent deems it advisable, in its sole discretion, it may submit to each Lender a written notification of its resignation as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, such resignation to be effective on the earlier to occur of (a) the thirtieth day after the date of such notice, and (b) the date upon which any successor to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, shall have accepted in writing its 55
appointment as successor Administrative Agent. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall automatically become a party to this Agreement and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent's rights, powers, privileges and duties as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Borrower and the Lenders shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting Administrative Agent, upon notice duly given, the Borrower agrees to make each payment when due under the Loan Documents directly to the Lenders entitled thereto during such time. 10.10 CO-SYNDICATION AGENTS AND DOCUMENTATION AGENT The Co-Syndication Agents and the Documentation Agent shall have no duties or obligations under the Loan Documents in their capacities as Co-Syndication Agents or Documentation Agent, respectively. 11. OTHER PROVISIONS 11.1 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may, from time to time, enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications of the Loan Documents and, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may execute and deliver to any such parties a written instrument waiving or consenting to the departure from, on such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of the Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences, PROVIDED that no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall (i) increase the Commitment Amount of any Lender without the consent of such Lender (PROVIDED that no waiver of a Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to constitute such an increase), (ii) extend the Commitment Period without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment, of the Fees without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) reduce the rate, or extend the time of payment of, interest on any Revolving Credit Loan, any Note or any Reimbursement Obligation (other than the applicability of any post-default increase in such rate of interest) without 56
the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (v) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation or principal on any Revolving Credit Loan or any Note without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vi) decrease or forgive the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Loan, any Note or any Reimbursement Obligation without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vii) consent to any assignment or delegation by the Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the consent of each Lender, (viii) change the provisions of this Section 11.1 without the consent of each Lender, (ix) change the definition of Required Lenders without the consent of each Lender, (x) change the several nature of the obligations of the Lenders without the consent of each Lender, (xi) change the sharing provisions among Lenders without the consent of each Lender, or (xii) extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit beyond the Commitment Termination Date without the consent of each Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall (A) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 or otherwise change any of the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent, the Issuer or the Swing Line Lender under any Loan Document without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, (B) change the Letter of Credit Commitment, change the amount or the time of payment of the Letter of Credit Commissions, or change any other term or provision which relates to the Letter of Credit Commitment or the Letters of Credit without the written consent of the Issuer, (C) change the Swing Line Commitment, change the amount or the time of payment of the Swing Line Loans or interest thereon or change any other term or provision which relates to the Swing Line Commitment or the Swing Line Loans without the written consent of the Swing Line Lender or (D) change the amount or the time of payment of any Competitive Bid Loan or interest thereon without the written consent of the Lender holding such Competitive Bid Loan. Any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the parties to the applicable Loan Document, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans and the Notes and the Reimbursement Obligations. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights under the Loan Documents, but any Default or Event of Default waived shall not extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 11.2 NOTICES Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile, as follows: 57

The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. 11.6 LENDING OFFICES Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to time to transfer any Loan to a different office of such Lender, subject to Section 3.10. 11.7 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (a) The provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each Credit Party) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of any Loan Document. (b) Any Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment or obligations in respect of its Letter of Credit Exposure or Swing Line Exposure and the applicable Loans at the time owing to it), to an Eligible Assignee, PROVIDED that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of all or any portion of its Commitment or obligations in respect of its Letter of Credit Exposure or Swing Line Exposure, the Issuing Bank and/or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall be for a pro rata portion of such Lender's Commitment and such Lender's then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, (iii) no assignments to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted (and any attempted assignment or transfer to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be null and void), (iv) the 60
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement together with, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire, and PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this subsection shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10 and 11.10). Except as otherwise provided under clause (iii) of this subsection, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under the Loan Documents that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of the Loan Documents as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (e) of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error, and the Borrower and each Credit Party may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Credit Party, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by subsection (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this subsection. (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or any Credit Party, sell participations to Eligible Assignees (each a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments, Letter of Credit Exposure, Swing Line Exposure and outstanding Loans owing to it), PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 61
performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower and the Credit Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents and (iv) no participations to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted (and any attempted participation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be null and void). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Documents, PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 11.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.8 as though it were a Lender, PROVIDED that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.10(c) as though it were a Lender. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.7 or 3.10 than the Lender that sold the participation to such Participant would have been entitled to receive with respect to the interest in the Loan Documents subject to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.10 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.10(b) as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to an Eligible SPC the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement, PROVIDED that (i) such designation shall not be effective unless the Borrower consents thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any Eligible SPC to fund any Loan, and (iii) if an Eligible SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The funding of a Loan by an Eligible SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender. As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each Eligible SPC shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement and otherwise, PROVIDED that (x) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Granting Lender and (y) its Granting 62
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such Granting Lender's obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Loans or portion thereof made by it. Each Granting Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Eligible SPC and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any Eligible SPC shall be paid to its Granting Lender as administrative agent for such Eligible SPC and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Granting Lender's application of such payments. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no Eligible SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Eligible SPC may (i) at any time, subject to payment of the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b), assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Lender (but nothing contained herein shall be construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder) or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such Eligible SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such Eligible SPC. This Section may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loans is being funded by an Eligible SPC at the time of such amendment. 11.8 COUNTERPARTS Each of the Loan Documents (other than the Notes) may be executed on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be charged. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all of the parties hereto shall be lodged with each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Any party to a Loan Document may rely upon the signatures of any other party thereto which are transmitted by fax or other electronic means to the same extent as if originally signed. 11.9 SET-OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS (a) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Issuer provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) or (b) or upon the acceleration of the Loans, each Lender and the Issuer shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness or other liability, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to such Lender or the Issuer arising under the Loan Documents, any amount owing from such Lender or the Issuer to the Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender or the Issuer against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in 63
possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender or the Issuer prior to the making, filing or issuance of, service upon such Lender or the Issuer of, or notice to such Lender or the Issuer of, any petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Lender and the Issuer agree promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after each such set-off and application made by such Lender or the Issuer, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. (b) If any Lender or the Issuer (each a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of its Loans or its Notes or the Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations) of payments then due and payable on account of the Loans and Notes received by all the Lenders or the Reimbursement Obligations, such Lender or the Issuer, as the case may be, shall forthwith purchase, without recourse, for cash, from the other Lenders such participations in their Loans and Notes or the Reimbursement Obligations as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender or the Issuer to share the excess payment with each of them according to their pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations), PROVIDED that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender or the Issuer, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender or the Issuer the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's pro rata share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender or the Issuer) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender or the Issuer so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may exercise such rights to payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender or the Issuer were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 11.10 INDEMNITY (a) The Borrower shall indemnify each Credit Party and each Related Party thereof (each such Person being called an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against, and hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnified Person, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Person arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any other transactions contemplated thereby (including the Eckerd Acquisition), (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated 64
by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto, PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower shall have no liability under clause (i) of this Section to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses relating to income or withholding taxes or any tax in lieu of such taxes. (b) To the extent that the Borrower fails to promptly pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under subsection (a) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the product of such unpaid amount MULTIPLIED BY (i) at any time when no Loans are outstanding, its Commitment Percentage, or if no Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage on the last day on which Commitments did exist, and (ii) at any time when Loans are outstanding (x) if the Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage or (y) if the Commitments have been terminated or otherwise no longer exist, the percentage equal to the fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of such Lender's Credit Exposure and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure (in each case determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. (c) The obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders under this Section 11.10 shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct and actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Loan Document or any agreement, instrument or other document contemplated thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or any Loan or any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 11.11 GOVERNING LAW The Loan Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 11.12 SEVERABILITY Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality 65
and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. 11.13 INTEGRATION All exhibits to the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a part thereof. Each Loan Document embodies the entire agreement and understanding between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. 11.14 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION Each Lender, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent agrees to maintain as confidential and not to disclose, publish or disseminate to any third parties any financial or other information relating to the business, operations and condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower provided to it, except if and to the extent that: (a) such information is in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (b) such information is required to be disclosed by subpoena or similar process or applicable law or regulations; (c) such information is required or requested to be disclosed to any regulatory or administrative body or commission to whose jurisdiction it may be subject; (d) such information is disclosed to its counsel, auditors or other professional advisors; (e) such information is disclosed to (and, unless and until it receives written objection from the Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to disclosure of such information to) its affiliates (and its affiliates' officers, directors and employees), PROVIDED that such information shall be used in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (f) such information is disclosed to its officers, directors and employees; (g) such information is disclosed with the prior written consent of the party furnishing the information; (h) such information is disclosed in connection with any litigation or dispute involving the Borrower and/or it; (i) such information is disclosed in connection with the sale of a participation or other disposition by it of any of its interest in this Agreement, PROVIDED that such information shall not be disclosed unless and until the party to whom it shall be disclosed shall have agreed to keep such information confidential as set forth herein; 66
(j) such information was in its possession or in its affiliate's possession as shown by clear and convincing evidence prior to any of the Borrower and/or any or the Borrower's representatives or agents furnishing such information to it; or (k) such information is received by it, without restriction as to its disclosure or use, from a Person who, to its knowledge or reasonable belief, was not prohibited from disclosing such information by any duty of confidentiality. Except to the extent prohibited or restricted by law or Governmental Authority, each Lender shall notify the Borrower promptly of any disclosures of information made by it as permitted pursuant to (h) above. 11.15 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Borrower acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, (b) by virtue of the Loan Documents, none of the Administrative Agent, the Issuer, or any Lender has any fiduciary relationship to the Borrower, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent, the Issuer, and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and (c) by virtue of the Loan Documents, no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders. 11.16 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION The Borrower irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal Court sitting in the City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court, after all appropriate appeals, shall be conclusive and binding upon it. 11.17 SERVICE OF PROCESS The Borrower agrees that process may be served against it in any suit, action or proceeding referred to in Section 11.16 by sending the same by first class mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier service, with receipt acknowledged, to the address of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.2. The Borrower agrees that any such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the fullest extent enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. 11.18 NO LIMITATION ON SERVICE OR SUIT Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification, waiver, or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent, the Issuer or any Lender to serve process in any 67

FIVE YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT EXHIBIT D-1 FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE BORROWER June 11, 2004 The Lenders, the Co-Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agent and the Administrative Agent Referred to Below c/o The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent One Wall Street New York, New York 10286 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am general counsel of CVS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER"), and have acted as such in connection with the Five Year Credit Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004, by and among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse First Boston and Wachovia Securities, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Documentation Agent, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering my opinions set forth below, I have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto (other than the Borrower) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted.
2. The Borrower is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower. 4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and Notes do not require any action or approval on the part of the shareholders of the Borrower or any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (i) United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or (iii) any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 5. The Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity. 6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" (as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended). 7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. To the best of my knowledge, there are no proceedings pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document or (b) which could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 8. To the best of my knowledge, the Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 2
9. To the best of my knowledge, no provision of any judgment, decree or order, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications: (a) I express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) in which any Lender is located which may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect. (b) I express no opinion as to provisions in the Credit Agreement which purport to create rights of set-off in favor of participants or which provide for set-off to be made otherwise than in accordance with applicable laws. (c) I note that public policy considerations or court decisions may limit the rights of any party to obtain indemnification under the Credit Agreement. I am a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal law of the United States of America and the Delaware General Corporation Law. For purposes of paragraph 5 of this opinion, I have assumed that, with your permission and without any research or investigation, the laws of the State of New York are identical to the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without my prior written consent, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion as if it were specifically addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof. Very truly yours, 3

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications and assumptions: (a) Our opinions are subject to the effects of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability, and the enforceability of indemnification provisions may be limited by Federal or State laws or policies underlying such laws. (b) As to various provisions in the Credit Agreement that grant the Administrative Agent or the Lenders certain rights to make determinations or take actions in their discretion, we assume that such discretion will be exercised in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. (c) We express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Lender is located that may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect. (d) We express no opinion as to the effect of Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar provisions of State law. (e) We have assumed, with your permission and without independent investigation, that (i) the Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action, and (iii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement (x) require no consent or other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law and (y) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (a) United States federal law or regulation or the Delaware
-3- June 11, 2004 General Corporation Law, or (b) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company. We are members of the bar of the State of New York and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (other than an assignee permitted under Section 11.7 of the Credit Agreement) without our prior written consent. Very truly yours,

AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LOANS 2.1 Loans Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender severally (and not jointly) agrees to make loans under this Agreement (each a "LOAN" and, collectively with each other Loan of such Lender and/or with each Loan of each other Lender, the "LOANS") to the Borrower 14
from time to time during the Commitment Period, during which period the Borrower may borrow and prepay in accordance with the provisions hereof. At the time of the making of any Loans, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans of all Lenders to be made will not exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount at such time. With respect to each Lender, at the time of the making of any Loan, the principal amount of such Lender's Loan constituting a part of the Loans to be made will not exceed the Commitment of such Lender at such time. Loans which are prepaid or repaid, in whole or in part, may not be reborrowed. At the option of the Borrower, indicated in a Borrowing Request, Loans may be made as ABR Advances or Eurodollar Advances. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Loans shall be due and payable on the Expiration Date. 2.2 NOTICE OF BORROWING LOANS The Borrower agrees to notify the Administrative Agent, which notification shall be irrevocable, no later than (a) Noon on the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of Loans to consist of ABR Advances and (b) 10:00 A.M. at least two Eurodollar Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of Loans to consist of Eurodollar Advances. Each such notice shall specify (i) the aggregate amount requested to be borrowed under the Commitments, (ii) the proposed Borrowing Date, (iii) whether a borrowing of Loans is to be of ABR Advances or Eurodollar Advances, and the amount of each thereof and (iv) the Eurodollar Interest Period for such Eurodollar Advances. Each such notice shall be promptly confirmed by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Request. Each Loan shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time. Each Eurodollar Advance to be made on a Borrowing Date, when aggregated with all amounts to be Converted to Eurodollar Advances on such date and having the same Eurodollar Interest Period as such Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each ABR Advance made on each Borrowing Date shall equal no less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notification to be confirmed by fax or other writing) of each such Borrowing Request. Subject to its receipt of each such notice from the Administrative Agent and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender shall make immediately available funds available to the Administrative Agent at the address therefor set forth in Section 11.2 not later than 1:00 P.M. (3:00 P.M. in the event that such Loans constitute ABR Advances requested on the proposed Borrowing Date) on each Borrowing Date in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Loans requested by the Borrower on such Borrowing Date. 2.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 2.4 USE OF PROCEEDS The Borrower agrees that the proceeds of the Loans shall be used solely to finance in part the purchase price of the Eckerd Acquisition or as a backup for commercial paper issued by the Borrower to finance in part the purchase price of the Eckerd Acquisition, in either case as a short term bridge to the expected completion by the Borrower of the issuance of long term 15
Indebtedness and/or equity securities in the aggregate amount of not less than $1 billion to refinance in full the Loans (it being understood that the Borrower makes no representations or warranties as to whether any such issuance will be consummated). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the Borrower further agrees that no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately (i) for a purpose which violates any law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority, including the provisions of Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended or any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 4.9 and (ii) to make a loan to any director or executive officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 2.5 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS (a) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTIONS. At the Borrower's option and upon at least three Domestic Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, or (ii) permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment Amount in part at any time and from time to time, PROVIDED that each such partial reduction shall be in an amount equal to at least $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and PROVIDED FURTHER that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the consummation of the issuance of long term Indebtedness or equity securities (such notice to specify the proposed effective date), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied and the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. (b) MANDATORY REDUCTIONS. The Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be automatically and permanently reduced by an amount equal to (i) the aggregate amount of Loans made on each Borrowing Date and (ii) the Net Proceeds (if any) remaining after each mandatory prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.6(b). Each reduction described in clause (i) shall be effective on the applicable Borrowing Date immediately after giving effect to the applicable borrowing and each reduction described in clause (ii) shall be effective concurrently with the earlier of any prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and the date such prepayment is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(b). (c) IN GENERAL. Each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be made by reducing each Lender's Commitment Amount by a sum equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such reduction. (d) TERMINATION. In addition to any termination or reduction of the Commitments as otherwise provided herein, the Commitments shall be automatically terminated and the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date. 16
2.6 PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS (a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may prepay Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, but subject to Section 3.5 at any time and from time to time, by notifying the Administrative Agent, which notification shall be irrevocable, at least two Eurodollar Business Days, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Advances or one Domestic Business Day, in the case of a prepayment of ABR Advances, prior to the proposed prepayment date specifying (i) the Loans to be prepaid, (ii) the amount to be prepaid, and (iii) the date of prepayment. Upon receipt of each such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each such notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable, PROVIDED that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.5(a), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.5(a), and the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. Each partial prepayment under this Section shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of ABR Advances) or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 ($100,000 in the case of ABR Advances) in excess thereof. (b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, then, after such Net Proceeds are received (but no later than one Business Day thereafter), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds. (c) IN GENERAL. Simultaneously with each prepayment hereunder, the Borrower shall prepay all accrued interest on the amount prepaid through the date of prepayment and indemnify the Lenders in accordance with Section 3.5. 2.7 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 2.8 NOTES Any Lender may request that the Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Person or, if requested by such Person, such Person and its registered assigns. Thereafter, all Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.7) be represented by a Note in like form payable to the order of the payee named therein and its registered assigns. 3. PROCEEDS, PAYMENTS, CONVERSIONS, INTEREST, YIELD PROTECTION AND FEES 3.1 DISBURSEMENT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOANS The Administrative Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Loans at its office specified in Section 11.2 by crediting to the Borrower's general deposit account with the Administrative Agent the funds received from each Lender. Unless the Administrative Agent shall 17
have received prior notice from a Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notice to be confirmed by fax or other writing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made by it on a Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in accordance with this Section, PROVIDED that such Lender received notice thereof from the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand, such corresponding amount (to the extent not previously paid by the other), together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of the Borrower, the applicable interest rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) and, in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date such payment is due until the third day after such date and, thereafter, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate PLUS 2%. Any such payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to its rights against such Lender. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Loans for purposes of this Agreement, which Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender on the Borrowing Date applicable to such Loans. 3.2 PAYMENTS (a) Each payment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on the Loans and of the Facility Fee (together with all of the other fees to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents, the "FEES"), and of all of the other amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 11.2 without setoff, deduction or counterclaim in funds immediately available in New York by 3:00 P.M. on the due date for such payment. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, PROVIDED that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders. Each payment of the Fees payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Commitment Amount and Credit Exposure. 18
(b) If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Facility Fee) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension. 3.3 CONVERSIONS; OTHER MATTERS (a) The Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to an ABR Advance by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Domestic Business Day's prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted. In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Eurodollar Interest Period relating thereto, PROVIDED that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, PROVIDED that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Eurodollar Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance. The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. (c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6). (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document: 19
(i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.2 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Loans or expiration of an Eurodollar Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3, (ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Eurodollar Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Expiration Date, and (iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances pursuant to a single Borrowing Request shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance for the purpose of calculating such limitation. 3.4 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES (a) PRIOR TO MATURITY. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), the Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates per annum set forth below: (b) AFTER MATURITY, LATE PAYMENT RATE. After maturity, whether by acceleration, notice of intention to prepay or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum until paid (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). Any payment of principal, interest or any Fees not paid on the date when due and payable shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate PLUS 2% per annum from the due date thereof until the date such payment is made (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). (c) HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with the Fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an 20
"UNQUALIFIED AMOUNT"), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a "COMPENSATORY INTEREST PAYMENT") equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts LESS all other Compensatory Interest Payments. (d) GENERAL. Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Expiration Date and, to the extent provided in Section 2.6(c), upon each prepayment of the Loans. Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the BNY Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate and the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the BNY Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the BNY Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 3.5 INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSS Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.2 or 3.3, as the case may be, (ii) a Eurodollar Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, or (iv) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the consummation of the issuance of long term Indebtedness or equity securities pursuant to Section 2.5 or 2.6, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender 21
which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith. 3.6 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS, ETC. If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on such Lender's capital or the capital of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling such Lender (each a "CONTROL PERSON"), or (B) the asset value (for capital purposes) to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account such Lender's or such Control Person's policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), (iii) will subject such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement or any Note, or (iv) will change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of principal, interest or fees payable under the Loan Documents (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, for any tax or changes in the rate of tax on such Lender's or such Control Person's net income) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively, "COSTS") attributable to such Lender's or such Control Person's compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change. Each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice). 22
3.7 ILLEGALITY OF FUNDING Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment. 3.8 OPTION TO FUND; SUBSTITUTED INTEREST RATE (a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Eurodollar Advance, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its portion of such Eurodollar Advance during the Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Eurodollar Advance and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Eurodollar Advance in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its portion of each Eurodollar Advance during the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its portion of such Eurodollar Advance and having a maturity corresponding to such Eurodollar Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10. (b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any 23
portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an "AFFECTED ADVANCE"), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances, (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances, and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances. Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof) Affected Advances, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances. 3.9 CERTIFICATES OF PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT Each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 3.10 TAXES; NET PAYMENTS (a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, PROVIDED that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or 24
withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to each Lender. If any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, such Lender shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to such Lender) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender in any respect.

jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 4.2 AUTHORITY The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower. 4.3 BINDING AGREEMENT The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy. 4.4 LITIGATION There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 4.5 NO CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS (a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.

Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement. 4.6 TAXES The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable.

To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, except for the notice provided for in the preceding sentence, the Borrower expressly waives any presentment, demand, protest, notice of protest or other notice of any kind in connection with the Loan Documents and its obligations thereunder. To the fullest extent not prohibited by law, the Borrower further expressly waives and covenants not to assert any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, redemption or similar law, now or at any time hereafter in force which might delay, prevent or otherwise impede the performance or enforcement of the Loan Documents. (b) In the event that the Commitments shall have been terminated or all of the Loans and the Notes shall have been declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree, among themselves, that any funds received from or on behalf of the Borrower under any Loan Document by any Lender (except funds received by any Lender as a result of a purchase from such Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.9(b)) shall be remitted to the Administrative Agent, and shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in payment of the Loans and the other obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents in the following manner and order: (1) first, to reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, in that order, for any expenses due from the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.5, (2) second, to the payment of the Fees, (3) third, to the payment of any expenses or amounts (other than the principal of and interest on the Loans and the Notes) payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders under the Loan Documents, (4) fourth, to the payment, pro rata according to the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of each Lender, of interest due on the Loans, (5) fifth, to the payment, pro rata according to the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of each Lender, of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans, and (6) sixth, any remaining funds shall be paid to whosoever shall be entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.

payment or the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Loan Documents. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall fail or refuse so to proceed, each Lender shall be entitled to take such action as the Required Lenders shall deem appropriate to enforce its rights under the Loan Documents. 10. AGENT 10.1 APPOINTMENT Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints BNY as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under the Loan Documents and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 10.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith upon the advice of such counsel. 10.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS None of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or such Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents (except the Administrative Agent for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any party contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, the Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Loan Documents or for any failure of the Borrower or any other Person to perform its obligations thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire into the observance or performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in, or conditions of, the Loan Documents, or to inspect the Property, books or records of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility to the Borrower or any other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance, or any breach, by any Lender of any of its obligations under any of the Loan Documents. The Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted under 42
the Loan Documents unless the Administrative Agent shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. 10.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, request, consent, certificate, affidavit, opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of the Loan Documents or any instrument, document or communication furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action not expressly required under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or, if required by Section 11.1, all Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Borrower, all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes. 10.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice thereof from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, PROVIDED that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action or give such directions, or refrain from taking such action or giving such directions, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Lenders. 10.6 NON-RELIANCE Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that such Lender has, independently and without reliance 43
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, evaluations and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that a copy of this Agreement and all exhibits and schedules hereto have been made available to it and its individual counsel for review, and each Lender acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance thereof. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 10.7 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 10.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BNY and each Affiliate thereof, may make loans to, accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as though it were not the Administrative Agent. With respect to the Commitment made or renewed by BNY and each Note issued to BNY (if any), BNY shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" shall include BNY. 10.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT If at any time the Administrative Agent deems it advisable, in its sole discretion, it may submit to each Lender a written notification of its resignation as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, such resignation to be effective on the earlier to occur of (a) the thirtieth day after the date of such notice, and (b) the date upon which any successor to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, shall have accepted in writing its appointment as successor Administrative Agent. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at 44
least $500,000,000. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall automatically become a party to this Agreement and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent's rights, powers, privileges and duties as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Borrower and the Lenders shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting Administrative Agent, upon notice duly given, the Borrower agrees to make each payment when due under the Loan Documents directly to the Lenders entitled thereto during such time. 10.10 CO-SYNDICATION AGENTS The Co-Syndication Agents shall have no duties or obligations under the Loan Documents in their capacities as Co-Syndication Agents. 11. OTHER PROVISIONS 11.1 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may, from time to time, enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications of the Loan Documents and, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may execute and deliver to any such parties a written instrument waiving or consenting to the departure from, on such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of the Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences, PROVIDED that no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall (i) increase the Commitment Amount of any Lender without the consent of such Lender (PROVIDED that no waiver of a Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to constitute such an increase), (ii) extend the Commitment Period without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment, of the Fees without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) reduce the rate, or extend the time of payment of, interest on any Loan or any Note (other than the applicability of any post-default increase in such rate of interest) without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (v) reduce the amount, or extend the time of payment of any payment of principal on any Loan or any Note without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vi) decrease or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or any Note without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (vii) consent to any assignment or delegation by the Borrower of any of its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the consent of each Lender, (viii) change the provisions of this Section 11.1 without the consent of each Lender, (ix) change the definition of Required Lenders without the consent of each Lender, (x) change the several nature of the obligations of the Lenders without the consent of each Lender, or (xi) change the sharing provisions among Lenders without the consent of each Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall amend, modify or waive any 45
provision of Section 10 or otherwise change any of the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document without the written consent of the Administrative Agent. Any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or consent shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the parties to the applicable Loan Document, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans and the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights under the Loan Documents, but any Default or Event of Default waived shall not extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 11.2 NOTICES Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile, as follows: IF TO THE BORROWER: CVS Corporation 1 CVS Drive Woonsocket, Rhode Island 02895 Attention: Philip C.

The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. 11.6 LENDING OFFICES Each Lender shall have the right at any time and from time to time to transfer any Loan to a different office of such Lender, subject to Section 3.10. 11.7 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (a) The provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.10 and 11.10). Except as otherwise provided under clause (iii) of this subsection, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under the Loan Documents that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of the Loan Documents as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (e) of this Section. (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error, and the Borrower and each Credit Party may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Credit Party, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the 49
processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by subsection (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this subsection. (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or any Credit Party, sell participations to Eligible Assignees (each a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and outstanding Loans owing to it), PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower and the Credit Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents and (iv) no participations to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted (and any attempted participation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates shall be null and void). Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Documents, PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 11.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.9 as though it were a Lender. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.7 or 3.10 than the Lender that sold the participation to such Participant would have been entitled to receive with respect to the interest in the Loan Documents subject to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.10 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.10 as though it were a Lender. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest, PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to an Eligible SPC the option to fund all or any part of any Loan 50
that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement, PROVIDED that (i) such designation shall not be effective unless the Borrower consents thereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any Eligible SPC to fund any Loan, and (iii) if an Eligible SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The funding of a Loan by an Eligible SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender. As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each Eligible SPC shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Agreement and otherwise, PROVIDED that (x) its voting rights under this Agreement shall be exercised solely by its Granting Lender and (y) its Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such Granting Lender's obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations in respect of the Loans or portion thereof made by it. Each Granting Lender shall act as administrative agent for its Eligible SPC and give and receive notices and other communications on its behalf. Any payments for the account of any Eligible SPC shall be paid to its Granting Lender as administrative agent for such Eligible SPC and neither the Borrower nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for any Granting Lender's application of such payments. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no Eligible SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Eligible SPC may (i) at any time, subject to payment of the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b), assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Lender (but nothing contained herein shall be construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder) or to any financial institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such Eligible SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such Eligible SPC. This Section may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loans is being funded by an Eligible SPC at the time of such amendment. 11.8 COUNTERPARTS Each of the Loan Documents (other than the Notes) may be executed on any number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of any Loan Document to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by the party to be charged. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all of the parties hereto shall be lodged with each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Any party to a Loan Document may rely upon the signatures of any other party thereto which are transmitted by fax or other electronic means to the same extent as if originally signed. 51
11.9 SET-OFF AND SHARING OF PAYMENTS (a) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) or (b) or upon the acceleration of the Loans, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower, to set-off and apply against any indebtedness or other liability, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower to such Lender arising under the Loan Documents, any amount owing from such Lender to the Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance of, service upon such Lender of, or notice to such Lender of, any petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after each such set-off and application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. (b) If any Lender (each a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of its Loans or its Notes in excess of its pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans) of payments then due and payable on account of the Loans and Notes received by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase, without recourse, for cash, from the other Lenders such participations in their Loans and Notes as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment with each of them according to their pro rata share (in accordance with the outstanding principal balance of all Loans), PROVIDED that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's pro rata share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section may exercise such rights to payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 11.10 INDEMNITY (a) The Borrower shall indemnify each Credit Party and each Related Party thereof (each such Person being called an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") against, and hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related 52
expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnified Person, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Person arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or any other transactions contemplated thereby (including the Eckerd Acquisition), (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto, PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Person, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower shall have no liability under clause (i) of this Section to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Person for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses relating to income or withholding taxes or any tax in lieu of such taxes. (b) To the extent that the Borrower fails to promptly pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under subsection (a) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the product of such unpaid amount MULTIPLIED BY (i) at any time when no Loans are outstanding, its Commitment Percentage, or if no Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage on the last day on which Commitments did exist, and (ii) at any time when Loans are outstanding (x) if the Commitments then exist, its Commitment Percentage or (y) if the Commitments have been terminated or otherwise no longer exist, the percentage equal to the fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the sum of such Lender's Credit Exposure and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the Aggregate Credit Exposure (in each case determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. (c) The obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders under this Section 11.10 shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the payment of the Loans and the Notes and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents. (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnified Person, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct and actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Loan Document or any agreement, instrument or other document contemplated thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. 53
11.11 GOVERNING LAW The Loan Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties thereto shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 11.12 SEVERABILITY Every provision of the Loan Documents is intended to be severable, and if any term or provision thereof shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof shall not be affected or impaired thereby, and any invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. 11.13 INTEGRATION All exhibits to the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a part thereof. Each Loan Document embodies the entire agreement and understanding between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between or among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof. 11.14 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees to maintain as confidential and not to disclose, publish or disseminate to any third parties any financial or other information relating to the business, operations and condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower provided to it, except if and to the extent that: (a) such information is in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (b) such information is required to be disclosed by subpoena or similar process or applicable law or regulations; (c) such information is required or requested to be disclosed to any regulatory or administrative body or commission to whose jurisdiction it may be subject; (d) such information is disclosed to its counsel, auditors or other professional advisors; (e) such information is disclosed to (and, unless and until it receives written objection from the Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to disclosure of such information to) its affiliates (and its affiliates' officers, directors and employees), provided that such information shall be used in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (f) such information is disclosed to its officers, directors and employees; 54
(g) such information is disclosed with the prior written consent of the party furnishing the information; (h) such information is disclosed in connection with any litigation or dispute involving the Borrower and/or it; (i) such information is disclosed in connection with the sale of a participation or other disposition by it of any of its interest in this Agreement, provided that such information shall not be disclosed unless and until the party to whom it shall be disclosed shall have agreed to keep such information confidential as set forth herein; (j) such information was in its possession or in its affiliate's possession as shown by clear and convincing evidence prior to any of the Borrower and/or any or the Borrower's representatives or agents furnishing such information to it; or (k) such information is received by it, without restriction as to its disclosure or use, from a Person who, to its knowledge or reasonable belief, was not prohibited from disclosing such information by any duty of confidentiality. Except to the extent prohibited or restricted by law or Governmental Authority, each Lender shall notify the Borrower promptly of any disclosures of information made by it as permitted pursuant to (h) above. 11.15 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Borrower acknowledges that (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, (b) by virtue of the Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship to the Borrower, and the relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and (c) by virtue of the Loan Documents, no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders. 11.16 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION The Borrower irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal Court sitting in the City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court, after all appropriate appeals, shall be conclusive and binding upon it. 11.17 SERVICE OF PROCESS The Borrower agrees that process may be served against it in any suit, action or proceeding referred to in Section 11.16 by sending the same by first class mail, return receipt 55
requested or by overnight courier service, with receipt acknowledged, to the address of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.2. The Borrower agrees that any such service (i) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action, or proceeding, and (ii) shall to the fullest extent enforceable by law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. 11.18 NO LIMITATION ON SERVICE OR SUIT Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification, waiver, or amendment thereto shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to serve process in any manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against the Borrower in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions. 11.19 WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE LENDERS AND THE BORROWER KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. FURTHER, THE BORROWER HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS, OR COUNSEL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS, HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR THE LENDERS WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, INTER ALIA, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. 11.20 EFFECTIVE DATE This Agreement shall be effective at such time (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") as the Administrative Agent shall have received executed counterparts hereof by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 through 5.4 have been or simultaneously will be satisfied, PROVIDED that this Agreement shall not become effective or be binding on any party hereto unless all of such conditions are satisfied not later than June 25, 2004. 56

BRIDGE FACILITY CREDIT AGREEMENT EXHIBIT D-1 FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE BORROWER June 11, 2004 The Lenders, the Co-Syndication Agents and the Administrative Agent Referred to Below c/o The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent One Wall Street New York, New York 10286 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am general counsel of CVS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER"), and have acted as such in connection with the Bridge Credit Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004, by and among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., Credit Suisse First Boston and Wachovia Securities, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents, and The Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement. I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering my opinions set forth below, I have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto (other than the Borrower) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies. Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted. 2. The Borrower is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect). 3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower. 4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and Notes do not require any action or approval on the part of the shareholders of the Borrower or any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (i) United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or (iii) any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 5. The Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity. 6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" (as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended). 7. To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. To the best of my knowledge, there are no proceedings pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document or (b) which could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Eckerd Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)). 8. To the best of my knowledge, the Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. 9. To the best of my knowledge, no provision of any judgment, decree or order, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, 2
or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications: (a) I express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) in which any Lender is located which may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect. (b) I express no opinion as to provisions in the Credit Agreement which purport to create rights of set-off in favor of participants or which provide for set-off to be made otherwise than in accordance with applicable laws. (c) I note that public policy considerations or court decisions may limit the rights of any party to obtain indemnification under the Credit Agreement. I am a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal law of the United States of America and the Delaware General Corporation Law. For purposes of paragraph 5 of this opinion, I have assumed that, with your permission and without any research or investigation, the laws of the State of New York are identical to the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without my prior written consent, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion as if it were specifically addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
