Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On September 14, 2004, CVS closed on the sale of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Notes and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 2014 Notes in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were used to repay commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of approximately 1,260 Eckerd drugstores (located mainly in the southern United States, including Texas and Florida), as well as Eckerd Health Services, which includes Eckerd's pharmacy benefits management and mail order businesses.
 
Under the Indenture, the 2009 Notes bear interest at the rate of 4% per annum and the 2014 Notes bear interest at the rate of 4

% per annum, in each case payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2005. The 2009 Notes will mature on September 15, 2009 and the 2014 Notes will mature on September 15, 2014. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company, which rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt from time to time. The Company may redeem any or all of the Notes of either series at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 10 basis points for the 2009 Notes or the applicable Treasury Yield plus 12.5 basis points for the 2014 Notes.
 
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state securities laws. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes.
 
The description of the provisions of the Indenture set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete terms contained in the Indenture, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4.1 to the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-4 dated September 15, 2004.
