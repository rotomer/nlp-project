Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, November 4, 2004 - CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced third quarter sales and earnings for the quarter ended October 2, 2004.
 
Net sales for the third quarter ended October 2, 2004 increased 24.0% to $7.91 billion, up from $6.38 billion during the third quarter of 2003, reflecting the impact of the acquisition on July 31, 2004, of 1,268 Eckerd drugstores, as well as Eckerd's pharmacy benefit management and mail order pharmacy business. Same store sales (i.e., sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 5.2%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 6.8% and front-end same store sales increased 1.8%. Same store sales do not include the sales results of the acquired drugstores mentioned above. The acquired stores will be included in same store sales following the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, beginning in fiscal August 2005. Total pharmacy sales represented 71.0% of total company sales for the quarter. Third party prescription sales were 93.8% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter decreased 1.7% to $184.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $187.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. The Company estimates that the Eckerd acquisition had a negative impact of approximately $0.07 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004. The Company's third quarter results compared to last year were driven by increased selling, general and administrative costs attributable to the integration of the acquired businesses, offset in part by continued strong margin performance.
 
"The third quarter was another strong quarter for CVS. The core business is thriving, and the integration of Eckerd's store and PBM businesses is ahead of schedule," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and CEO of CVS Corporation. "We delivered healthy sales growth and better-than-expected gross margin improvement, resulting in solid earnings performance," concluded Mr. Ryan.
 
For the third quarter, CVS acquired 1,268 drugstores, opened 49 new stores, closed 140 stores and relocated 37 others. As of October 2, 2004, CVS operated 5,383 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 36 states and the District of Columbia.

Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing (i) net earnings, after accounting for the difference between the dividends on the ESOP preference stock and common stock and after making adjustments for the incentive compensation plans by (ii) Basic shares plus the additional shares that would be issued assuming that all dilutive stock options are exercised and the ESOP preference stock is converted into common stock. The dilutive earnings adjustment was $1.3 million and $1.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003 respectively. The dilutive earnings adjustment was $4.0 million and $4.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003 respectively.
