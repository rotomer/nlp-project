FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, May 5, 2005 - CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced record sales and earnings for the first quarter ended April 2, 2005.
 
Net sales for the first quarter ended April 2, 2005 increased 34.7% to $9.18 billion, up from $6.82 billion during the first quarter of 2004. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) for the quarter rose 8.2%, while pharmacy same store sales rose 8.8% and front-end same store sales increased 6.9%. Same store sales do not include the acquired Eckerd drugstores, which will be included in same store sales beginning in August 2005. The Company estimates the Easter shift had a positive impact of approximately 140 basis points on front-end same store sales for the thirteen-week period, and 45 basis points on total same store sales. Total pharmacy sales represented 71.1% of total company sales for the quarter.  Third party prescription sales were 93.8% of pharmacy sales for the quarter.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter increased 18.4% to $289.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $244.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004.
 
"The first quarter of 2005 was one of great accomplishment," stated Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Corporation. "Our core business is thriving, and we continue to gain share in the pharmacy and front-end businesses. We saw continued sales growth, good margin performance, and solid expense control. At the same time, we made considerable progress on the integration of the Eckerd assets.
 
"I am very pleased to report that the aggregate sales results of the 1,100 former Eckerd stores are trending positive to last year, having been in steep decline at the time we acquired them," continued Mr. Ryan. "We are at the very beginning of what we expect to be a multi-year turnaround of the acquired stores.
 
"Furthermore, Eckerd Healthcare Services is now fully integrated with PharmaCare, and they are operating as one company. We are well positioned to continue to grow and serve both our corporate and managed care clients," Mr. Ryan concluded.
 
For the first quarter, CVS opened 51 new stores, closed 17 stores and relocated 45 others.  As of April 2, 2005, CVS operated 5,409 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 36 states and the District of Columbia.

(1) Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing (i) net earnings, after accounting for the difference between the dividends on the ESOP preference stock and common stock and after making adjustments for the incentive compensation plans by (ii) Basic shares plus the additional shares that would be issued assuming that all dilutive stock options are exercised and the ESOP preference stock is converted into common stock. The dilutive earnings adjustment was $1.1 million and $1.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004, respectively.
