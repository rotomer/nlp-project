Section 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of stockholders may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer and may not be called by any other person.
 
Special meetings shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as is specified in the call thereof.
 
Section 3.  NOTICE OF MEETING; WAIVER.  Unless otherwise required by statute, the notice of every meeting of the stockholders shall be in writing and signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer (or the President or a Vice President or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, in each case acting at the direction of the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer) and shall state the time when and the place where it is to be held, and a copy thereof shall be served, either personally or by mail, upon each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the meeting.  If the meeting to be held is other than the annual meeting of stockholders, the notice shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and shall indicate that it is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the meeting.  If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if taken, entitle stockholders to receive payment for their shares pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect.  If the notice is mailed, it shall be directed to a stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the record of stockholders unless the stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the corporation a written request that notices intended for the stockholder be mailed to some other address, in which case it shall be mailed to the address designated in such request.
 
Notice of a meeting need not be given to any stockholder who submits a signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting.  The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by the stockholder.
 
Section 4.  QUORUM.  At any meeting of the stockholders the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and being present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless the representation of a different number shall be required by law or by another provision of these bylaws, and in that case the representation of the number so required shall constitute a quorum.
 
If the holders of the amount of shares necessary to constitute a quorum shall fail to attend in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting may adjourn from time to time without further notice other than by an announcement made at the meeting.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
 
Section 5.  ORGANIZATION.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in his absence, the Chief Executive Officer or, in his absence, the President, any Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President or Vice President in the order of their seniority or in such other order as may be designated by the Board of Directors, shall call meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of such meetings.  The Board of Directors or the Executive Committee may appoint any stockholder to act as chairman of any meeting in the absence of any of such officers and in the event of such absence and the failure of such board or committee to appoint a chairman, the stockholders present at such meeting may nominate and appoint any stockholder to act as chairman.
 
The Secretary of the corporation, or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, but, in the absence of said officers, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Written consent thus given by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of the stockholders.
 
Section 8.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Board of Directors, in advance of any stockholders' meeting, may appoint one or more Inspectors of Election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If Inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at a
stockholders' meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder entitled to vote thereat, shall appoint one or more inspectors.  In case any person appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat.  Inspectors shall be sworn.
