Section 1.05. .
Consents; Assignment of Contracts and Rights
 
(a) Sellers shall use: (i) commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all material consents of third parties that are identified in writing by Buyer to the transfer of the Purchased Assets; and (ii) reasonable best efforts to obtain consents from landlords under those Leases that require a landlord's consent to an assignment that are identified in writing by Buyer; , neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be required to pay any consideration or incur any additional liability in order to obtain such consents, subject to the provisions of Section 1.05(d).
provided, however
 
(b) Subject to Section 1.05(a), Sellers agree, in connection with requests for consents to landlords for assignments of Leases requiring the same, to make requests as soon as practicable after the date hereof and to pursue such requests in a good faith and diligent manner. Sellers further agree to provide Buyer with detailed progress reports on such requested consents on at least a weekly basis. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Sellers' efforts and to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents, by supplying any commercially reasonable information requested by the landlords who are considering such requests. In addition, in connection with those Leases that merely require that the tenant provide notices before or after an assignment, Sellers agree to send such notices to those landlords identified in writing by Buyer in the form prepared by Buyer and within the timeframes identified by Buyer.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assigned Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if and for so long as such assignment, without the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of such Assigned Contract or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or the Sellers thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of any Seller thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Buyer and each Seller will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and perform and discharge the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, or under which such Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer at Buyer's sole cost and expense, with Buyer being responsible for the performance and discharge of such Seller's obligations, any and all rights of the Sellers against a third party.
 
(d) If any landlord that has the right to consent to an assignment of a Lease refuses or fails to give its consent to the assignment of such Lease, or if any right of sublease, recapture or termination by any landlord would be triggered by the request for
 
consent to assignment (collectively, "") and Sellers or any of its Affiliates are permitted to sublease, license or otherwise arrange for Buyer to occupy the premises demised by the Lease for the permitted use under such Lease (an ""), then in all such cases upon the written request of Buyer, Seller shall enter into a sublease, license or Occupancy Agreement with Buyer for such Store on a fully net basis and on such terms as will generally confer and impose on Buyer all of Sellers' rights and obligations under the Lease for such Store until such landlord consents to the assignment of the Lease to Buyer and Buyer will indemnify Sellers for any and all liabilities, costs and expenses of Sellers arising out of the respective Lease and any related Occupancy Agreement, any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with any attempt to transfer or failure to transfer such Lease or any other liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or resulting from the Sellers' actions taken in accordance with any reasonable directions of Buyer in connection with such Lease. If and when any such consent shall be obtained or such Lease shall otherwise become assignable, the respective Occupancy Agreement shall be terminated with no further obligations of the Sellers, Sellers shall promptly assign all their rights and obligations under the respective Lease to the Buyer without payment of further consideration (subject to the foregoing indemnity by Buyer of Sellers) and the Buyer shall, without the payment of any further consideration therefor, assume such all rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arrangement described in the immediately preceding clauses of this Section 1.05(d) is impracticable or will cause (or is likely to cause) a default under any Lease or the triggering of any Landlord Rights (whether due to the change or intended change of the store brand under which such property will be operated or for other reasons), then the parties will work in good faith to establish a mutually satisfactory arrangement for the operation by Buyer of such leased real property during the period subsequent to the Closing and pending receipt of the required consent, including a fair and equitable arrangement (under the applicable circumstances) to ensure that Sellers are fully reimbursed for all costs and expenses with respect to such Lease during such period. Sellers shall not be obligated to take or refrain from taking any actions which could reasonably be expected to trigger or cause the exercise of any Landlord Rights, subject to the further provisions of this Section 1.05(d). In the event a landlord wrongfully refuses or fails to consent to an assignment or a request for an assignment would trigger any Landlord Rights, and a sublease, license or Occupancy Agreement is not permitted under the terms of the applicable Lease, Seller agrees, upon written request from Buyer and at Buyer's sole cost and expense, to institute litigation against such landlord with counsel selected by Buyer (and reasonably acceptable to Seller) to enforce Sellers' rights under such Lease and Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller with respect to all such litigation and all costs, expenses, losses and damages resulting therefrom under or in connection with any affected Lease. The Standalone Drug Transition Services Agreement shall provide that in the event that Sellers' rights under any Leases have been transferred to New Diamond or any Affiliate through the Merger Agreement or otherwise, that the obligations of Sellers under this paragraph shall be assumed by New Diamond or its relevant Affiliate.

Whenever possible, such prorations shall be based on actual, current payments by the Sellers or their Affiliates and to the extent such actual amounts are not available, such prorations shall be estimated as of the Effective Time based on actual amounts for the most recent comparable billing period. When the actual amounts become known, such prorations shall be recalculated by Buyer and the Sellers, and Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, promptly (but not later than 10 Business Days after notice of payment due and delivery of reasonable supporting documentation with respect to such amounts) shall make any additional payment or refund so that the correct prorated amount is paid by each of Buyer and the Sellers.

(b) Percentage rent payable under each Lease shall be prorated at the end of the current lease year for each Lease, and the percentage rent payable, if any, shall be paid by Buyer when due and the Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer a portion thereof determined by multiplying (A) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Sellers' or their Affiliates' gross annual sales at such Store from the first day of such lease year to (and excluding) the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the sum of Buyer's and its Affiliates' and the Sellers' and their Affiliates' gross annual sales at such Store for the entire lease year, times (B) the amount of percentage rent actually due under the Lease for such Store.

The Indemnitor shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof and as otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitor's request) the provision to the Indemnitor of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and the use of commercially reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided thereunder.

The Indemnitor may settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim with the written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or without such consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (A) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a statement or admission of fault or culpability on the part of any Indemnitee.
 
(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if a Third Party Claim relates to Apportioned Obligations, Buyer shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and (B) if a Third Party Claim relates to Transfer Taxes, New Diamond and SUPERVALU shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party Claim (any Third Party Claim referred to above in this clause (iv), a "").

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RI, JANUARY 23, 2006  CVS Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement under which it will acquire approximately 700 standalone Sav-on and Osco drugstores, as well as a distribution center located in La Habra, California, from Albertson's, Inc., for $2.930 billion in cash immediately preceding the planned merger of Albertson's and Supervalu, Inc. Approximately half of the drugstores are located in southern California, with others in CVS' existing markets in numerous states across the Midwest and Southwest. CVS will also acquire Albertson's owned real estate interests in the drugstores for $1.0 billion in cash, and intends to sell these interests at or soon after closing in a sale-leaseback transaction of equivalent value.
 
Following completion of the transaction, CVS/pharmacy will strengthen its position as the nation's largest retail pharmacy chain operating 6,100 stores across 42 states and the District of Columbia.
 
Tom Ryan, Chairman, President and CEO of CVS Corporation, said: "This transaction offers significant long-term strategic and financial benefits. It provides immediate market share leadership in the high-growth, L.A./Orange County and San Diego markets, which are new markets for us, and also strengthens our position in many existing markets in the Midwest and Southwest. We expect the transaction to be accretive to both earnings and cash flow in its first full year.
 
"The acquisition also provides economies of scale as well as a platform for further growth in California. The stores we have opened there to date are performing well ahead of our expectations. However, finding desirable real estate in southern California is challenging and takes longer than in most other parts of the country. This transaction offers speed-to-market in these fast-growing regions. In addition, we are picking up high-volume stores in our existing states, such as Illinois, Indiana,
Missouri, and Arizona. Most of the market positions we're gaining are #1 or #2 shares, and these are also large and growing markets. So we are acquiring high-volume stores with valuable real estate. And, importantly, we are gaining talented associates with a track record of operating successful drug stores," Mr. Ryan concluded.
 
CVS expects that the acquisition will enable it to achieve annual cost synergies through economies of scale in advertising, distribution and purchasing, as well as other SG&A efficiencies.
 
Dave Rickard, Chief Financial Officer, said: "We are purchasing very high quality assets at a multiple of about 0.5x sales. We expect this acquisition to be less than 10 cents dilutive to 2006 earnings per share, after integration and non-recurring expenses associated with the transaction. In 2007 we expect the acquisition to be approximately 2 to 4 cents accretive to diluted earnings per share, and in 2008 we expect it to be approximately 5 to 10 cents accretive to diluted earnings per share. The cash flow effects parallel the earnings effects in terms of dilution and accretion."
 
CVS expects to finance the transaction with a combination of short- and long-term debt. Closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in mid-2006, is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as well as other customary closing conditions. Further, closing is also conditioned on consummation of the merger between Albertson's and Supervalu, which is also subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions, as well as approval by the shareholders of Albertson's and Supervalu. Evercore Partners served as financial advisor and Davis Polk & Wardwell served as legal advisor to CVS in this transaction.
 
CVS will be holding a conference call today for the investment community at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss this transaction. The call will be simulcast on the Company's website for all interested parties. To access the webcast, visit the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investor.CVS.com to hear the call live, or to listen to an archive of the call which will be available for a one-week period following the call.

With more than 40 years of dynamic growth in the retail pharmacy industry, CVS is committed to being the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use.
