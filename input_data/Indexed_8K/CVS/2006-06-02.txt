Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Asset.
On June 2, 2006, CVS Corporation ("CVS") and its wholly owned subsidiary, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. ("CVS Pharmacy"), completed the acquisition of, approximately 700 standalone drugstores and a distribution center in La Habra, California (collectively the "Standalone Drug Business") from Albertson's, Inc. ("Albertson's"). The Standalone Drug Business includes retail drugstores located primarily in southern California, Illinois, Arizona, Indiana, Nevada, Missouri, Wisconsin and Kansas.
CVS' acquisition of the Standalone Drug Business is structured as an asset purchase, with a purchase price under the Asset Purchase Agreement of $3.93 billion. CVS obtained funding for the acquisition through a combination of proceeds from its Bridge Facility and the issuance of commercial paper. CVS expects to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowing with longer term financing during the third quarter of 2006. In addition, CVS expects to monetize all or a substantial portion of the owned real estate interests relating to the acquired drugstores for up to $1.0 billion in a sale lease-back transaction.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received prior notice from a Lender (by telephone or otherwise, such notice to be confirmed by fax or other writing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made by it on a Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date in accordance with this Section, that such Lender received notice thereof from the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand, such corresponding amount (to the extent not previously paid by the other), together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of the Borrower, the applicable interest rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) and, in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date such payment is due until the third day after such date and, thereafter, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate 2%.

The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders. Each payment of the Fees payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Commitment Amount or, if the Commitments shall have terminated or been terminated, according to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Loans.

provided
 
made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Eurodollar Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance.

(c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6).
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document:
(i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.2 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Loans or expiration of an Eurodollar Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3,
(ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Eurodollar Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.5, and
(iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances pursuant to a single Borrowing Request shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance for the purpose of calculating such limitation.

(c) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with the Fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an ), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a ) equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts all other Compensatory Interest Payments.

(d) . Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Commitment Termination Date and, to the extent provided in Section 2.6(d), upon each prepayment of the Loans. Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become
General
 
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the BNY Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate and the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the BNY Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the BNY Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.2 or 3.3, as the case may be, (ii) a Eurodollar Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, or (iv) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the consummation of the issuance of long term Indebtedness or equity securities pursuant to Section 2.5 or 2.6, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith.
 
If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on such Lender's capital or the capital of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling such Lender (each a ), or (B) the asset value (for capital purposes) to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of

the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account such Lender's or such Control Person's policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), (iii) will subject such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement or any Note, or (iv) will change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of principal, interest or fees payable under the Loan Documents (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, for any tax or changes in the rate of tax on such Lender's or such Control Person's net income) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively, ) attributable to such Lender's or such Control Person's compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change. Each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this Section.
"Costs"
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice).
 
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the
 
Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment.
 
(a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Eurodollar Advance, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance during the Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Eurodollar Advance and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Eurodollar Advance in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its Commitment Percentage of each Eurodollar Advance during the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance and having a maturity corresponding to such Eurodollar Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10.
(b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an ), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances, (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances, and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances. Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof)
"Affected Advance"
 
Affected Advances, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances.
 
Each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to each Lender. If any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, such Lender shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to such Lender) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender in any respect. In the event that any Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit applicable to the payments made by the Borrower in respect of such Lender under this Section.
provided
 
(b) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrower is liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required by the Internal Revenue Code.
 
The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata account of each Lender a fee (the ) during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the Expiration Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Date shall have occurred, and on the Expiration Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin of (a) prior to the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.5, the Commitment Amount of such Lender (whether used or unused), and (b) thereafter, the outstanding principal balance of all Loans of such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Facility Fee shall be payable upon demand. In addition, upon each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to Sections 2.5(a) or 2.5(b), the Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount of such reduction through the date of such reduction. The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
"Facility Fee"
 
 
If the Borrower is obligated to pay to any Lender any amount under Section 3.6 or 3.10, the Borrower shall have the right within 90 days thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of Section 11.7(b), if no Default or Event of Default shall exist, to replace such Lender (the ) with one or more other assignees (each a ), that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Acceptance Agreements pursuant to Section 11.7(b) (with the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b) payable pursuant to said Section 11.7(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment and the outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay the following: (a) to the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and (B) an amount equal to all accrued, but unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender and (b) to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to all amounts owed by such

"Replacement Lender"
provided
 
Replaced Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, a corresponding amount of which was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1 and which has not been repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Replaced Lender or the Borrower, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 3.13, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement that are intended to survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of the Loans.
 
In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, and the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders:
 
Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in such good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect), has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect).
 
The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower.
 
The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy.
 
There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Albertson's Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)).
 
(a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents.
(b) No provision of any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement or of any existing statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement.
 
The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens
 
permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with respect to all federal, state, local and other taxes are considered by the management of the Borrower to be adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (b) is or might be due and payable against it or any Subsidiary or any Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP or which have been assessed but are not yet due and payable.
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all Governmental Authorities, a violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed with all Governmental Authorities all reports, applications, documents, instruments and information required to be filed pursuant to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requests which, if not so filed, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary nor any corporation controlling the Borrower or any Subsidiary or under common control with the Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to any statute or regulation which regulates the incurrence of Indebtedness.
 
The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. No part of the proceeds of the Loans has been or will be used, directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for a purpose which violates any law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to or on behalf of the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable law, regulation or statute, including said Regulation U. Following application of the proceeds of each Loan, not more than 25% (or such greater or lesser percentage as is provided in the exclusions from the definition of Indirectly Secured contained in said Regulation U as in effect at the time of the making of such Loan) of the value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a

The Borrower, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate have complied with the material requirements of Section 515 of ERISA with respect to each Pension Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, except where the failure to so comply would not be material. The Borrower, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has, as of the date hereof, made all contributions or payments to or under each Pension Plan required by law or the terms of such Pension Plan or any contract or agreement.

Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary (a) has received written notice or otherwise learned of any claim, demand, action, event, condition, report or investigation indicating or concerning any potential or actual liability which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, arising in connection with (i) any non-compliance with or violation of the requirements of any applicable federal, state or local environmental health or safety statute or regulation, or (ii) the release or threatened release of any toxic or hazardous waste, substance or constituent, or other substance into the environment, (b) to the best knowledge of the Borrower, has any threatened or actual liability in connection with the release or threatened release of any toxic or hazardous waste, substance or constituent, or other substance into the

Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints BNY as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under the Loan Documents and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
 
Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties, and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith upon the advice of such counsel.

The Administrative Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility to the Borrower or any other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance, or any breach, by any Lender of any of its obligations under any of the Loan Documents. The Lenders acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted under the Loan Documents unless the Administrative Agent shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, request, consent, certificate, affidavit, opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of the Loan Documents or any instrument, document or
 
communication furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action not expressly required under the Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or, if required by Section 11.1, all Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Borrower, all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice thereof from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating such notice is a Notice of Default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action or give such directions, or refrain from taking such action or giving such directions, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Lenders.

Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that such Lender has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, evaluations and decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that a copy of this Agreement and all exhibits and schedules hereto have been made available to it and its individual counsel for review, and each Lender acknowledges that it is satisfied with the form and substance thereof.

BNY and each Affiliate thereof, may make loans to, accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as though it were not the Administrative Agent.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent, that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall automatically become a party to this Agreement and shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent's rights, powers, privileges and duties as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Borrower and the Lenders shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting Administrative Agent, upon notice duly given, the Borrower agrees to make each payment when due under the Loan Documents directly to the Lenders entitled thereto during such time.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy,
 
custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receivers, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing or issuance of, service upon such Lender of, or notice to such Lender of, any petition, assignment for the benefit of creditors, appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver, or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant.

The Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower of such payment by the Issuer of a draft drawn under a Letter of Credit, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to make reimbursement when due.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute the payments made by each Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to the Issuer promptly upon receipt thereof in like funds as received. Each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and the Issuer from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) resulting from any failure on the part of such Lender to provide, or from any delay in providing, the Administrative Agent with such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of any payment made by the Issuer under a Letter of Credit in accordance with this clause (b) above (except in respect of losses, liabilities or other obligations suffered by the Administrative Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be, resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or the Issuer, as the case may be).

(c) Whenever the Administrative Agent is reimbursed by the Borrower, for the account of the Issuer, for any payment under a Letter of Credit and such payment relates to an amount previously paid by a Lender in respect of its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment under such Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent (or the Issuer, if such payment by a Lender was paid by the Administrative Agent to the Issuer) will promptly pay over such payment to such Lender.
 
The Borrower's obligation to reimburse the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuer for each payment under or in respect of each Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent, the Issuer, the Swing Line Lender, any Lender or any other Person, including, without limitation, any defense based on the failure of any drawing to conform to the terms of such Letter of Credit, any drawing document proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid, or the legality, validity, regularity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, that, with respect to any Letter of Credit, the foregoing shall not relieve the Issuer of any liability it may have to the Borrower for any actual damages sustained by the Borrower arising from a wrongful payment (or failure to pay) under such Letter of Credit made as a result of the Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
provided
 
Any Lender may request that the Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Person or, if requested by such Person, such Person and its registered assigns. Thereafter, all Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.7) be represented by a Note in like form payable to the order of the payee named therein and its registered assigns.
 
 
The Administrative Agent shall disburse the proceeds of the Loans (other than the Swing Line Loans) at its office specified in Section 11.2 by crediting to the Borrower's general deposit account with the Administrative Agent the funds received from each Lender.

If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand, such corresponding amount (to the extent not previously paid by the other), together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of the
provided
 
Borrower, the applicable interest rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) and, in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate from the date such payment is due until the third day after such date and, thereafter, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate 2%. Any such payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to its rights against such Lender. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Loans for purposes of this Agreement, which Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender on the Borrowing Date applicable to such Loans.

(a) Each payment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on the Loans and of the Facility Fee, the Utilization Fee and the Letter of Credit Participation Fee (collectively, together with all of the other fees to be paid to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuer and the Swing Line Lender in connection with the Loan Documents, the ), and of all of the other amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 11.2 without setoff, deduction or counterclaim in funds immediately available in New York by 3:00 P.M. on the due date for such payment. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the: (i) Revolving Credit Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders, (ii) Competitive Bid Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each applicable Lender and (iii) Swing Line Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to the Swing Line Lender. Each payment of the Facility Fee and the Letter of Credit Participation Fee payable to the Lenders shall be promptly transmitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender pro rata according to such Lender's Commitment Amount or, if the Commitments shall have terminated or been terminated, according to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans.

(b) If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period or Competitive Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar
 
Business Day, as the case may be, and (except with respect to payments in respect of the Facility Fee, the Utilization Fee and the Letter of Credit Participation Fee) interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension.
 
(a) The Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert one or more Eurodollar Advances to an ABR Advance by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Domestic Business Day's prior irrevocable notice of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted. In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. at least two Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Interest Period relating thereto, that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance. The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6).
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document:
(i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.3 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Revolving Credit Loans or expiration of an Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Revolving Credit Loans subject to such borrowing or
 
such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3,
(ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Commitment Termination Date or such earlier date upon which all of the Commitments shall have been voluntarily terminated by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.6, and
(iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than 15 Eurodollar Advances and Competitive Bid Loans, in the aggregate, outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances or Competitive Bid Loans pursuant to a single Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request, as the case may be, shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan for the purpose of calculating such limitation.

same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an ), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a ) equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts all other Compensatory Interest Payments.

Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the BNY Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate, the Eurodollar Rate and the Competitive Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the BNY Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the BNY Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

Loan shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (other than the termination of a Swing Line Loan resulting from a Mandatory Borrowing at a time when no Default or Event of Default shall exist), (iv) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (other than the repayment or prepayment of a Swing Line Loan resulting from a Mandatory Borrowing at a time when no Default or Event of Default shall exist), or (v) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments, the Swing Line Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.7, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be, or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance, Competitive Bid Loan or Swing Line Loan, as the case may be, and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith.

"Costs"
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice).
 
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment.
 
(a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Swing Line Loan, a Eurodollar Advance or a Competitive Bid Loan, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or its Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan during the Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Swing Line Loan, Eurodollar Advance or Competitive Bid Loan and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. The Swing Line Lender and each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Swing Line Loan, Eurodollar Advance and
 
Competitive Bid Loan in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its Commitment Percentage of each Eurodollar Advance or its Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, during the applicable Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance or the amount of such Swing Line Loan or Competitive Bid Loan, as the case may be, and having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10.
(b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an ), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by telephone or otherwise, to be promptly confirmed in writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans), and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances (or, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Competitive Bid Loans). Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof) Affected Advances, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances.
"Affected Advance"
 
Each Issuer and each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by the Issuer and each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuer and the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Issuer and the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, that the Lenders, the Issuer and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to the Issuer and each Lender. If any payment to the Issuer or any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, in any respect. In the event that the Issuer or any Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section, the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit applicable to the payments made by the Borrower in respect of the Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, under this Section.

(b) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
 
Borrower shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrower is liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required by the Internal Revenue Code.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, on and after the Commitment Termination Date, the Facility Fee shall be payable upon demand. In addition, upon each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount of such reduction through the date of such reduction. The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

In order to induce the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuer to enter into this Agreement, the Lenders to make the Loans and the Issuer to issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuer:
 
Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in such good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect), has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect).
 
The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower.
 
The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy.
 
There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the
 
Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Albertson's Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)).
 
(a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents.
(b) No provision of any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement or of any existing statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement.
 
The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with respect to all federal, state, local and other taxes are considered by the management of the Borrower to be adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (b) is or might be due and payable against it or any Subsidiary or any Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP or which have been assessed but are not yet due and payable.
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all Governmental Authorities, a violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed with all Governmental Authorities all reports, applications, documents, instruments and information required to be filed pursuant to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and requests which, if not so filed, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary nor any corporation controlling the Borrower or any Subsidiary or under common control with the Borrower or any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to any statute or regulation which regulates the incurrence of Indebtedness.
 
The Borrower is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. No part of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit has been or will be used, directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for a purpose which violates any law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the Issuer nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to or on behalf of the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable law, regulation or statute, including said Regulation U. Following application of the proceeds of each Loan and the issuance of each Letter of Credit, not more than 25% (or such greater or lesser percentage as is provided in the exclusions from the definition of Indirectly Secured contained in said Regulation U as in effect at the time of the making of such Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit) of the value of the assets of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis that are subject to Section 8.2 will be Margin Stock. In addition, no part of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to make a loan to any director or executive officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.2
Payments
(a) Each payment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on the Loans and of all of the other amounts to be paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 11.2 without setoff, deduction or counterclaim in funds immediately available in New York by 3:00 P.M. on the due date for such payment. The failure of the Borrower to make any such payment by such time shall not constitute a default hereunder, that such payment is made on such due date, but any such payment made after 3:00 P.M. on such due date shall be deemed to have been made on the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, for the purpose of calculating interest on amounts outstanding on the Loans. If the Borrower has not made any such payment prior to 3:00 P.M., the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deduct the amount of any such payment from such account(s) as the Borrower may from time to time designate in writing to the Administrative Agent, upon which the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such deduction to such payment. Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, each payment of principal and interest on the Loans shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent in like funds as received to each Lender (a) first, pro rata according to the amount of interest which is then due and payable to the Lenders, and (b) second, pro rata according to the amount of principal which is then due and payable to the Lenders.
provided
(b) If any payment hereunder or under the Loans shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, the due date thereof (except as otherwise provided in the definition of Eurodollar Interest Period) shall be extended to the next Domestic Business Day or Eurodollar Business Day, as the case may be, and interest shall be payable at the applicable rate specified herein during such extension.

In addition, the Borrower may elect at any time and from time to time to Convert an ABR Advance to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances or to Convert any one or more existing Eurodollar Advances to any one or more new Eurodollar Advances by giving the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 A.M. at least two Eurodollar Business Days' prior irrevocable notice, in the case of a Conversion to Eurodollar Advances, of such election, specifying the amount to be so Converted and the initial Eurodollar Interest Period relating thereto, that any Conversion of an ABR Advance to Eurodollar Advances shall only be made on a Eurodollar Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the Lenders with notice of each such election. Each Conversion of Loans from one Type to another shall be made pro rata according to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. ABR Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be Converted pursuant to this Section in whole or in part, that the amount to be Converted to each Eurodollar Advance, when aggregated with any Eurodollar Advance to be made on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 and having the same Eurodollar Interest Period as such first Eurodollar Advance, shall equal no less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, the Borrower shall have no right to elect to Convert any existing ABR Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance or to Convert any existing Eurodollar Advance to a new Eurodollar Advance. In such event, such ABR Advance shall be automatically continued as an ABR Advance or such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically Converted to an ABR Advance on the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance. The foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(c) Each Conversion shall be effected by each Lender by applying the proceeds of each new ABR Advance or Eurodollar Advance, as the case may be, to the existing Advance (or portion thereof) being Converted (it being understood that such Conversion shall not constitute a borrowing for purposes of Sections 4, 5 or 6).
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document:
(i) if the Borrower shall have failed to elect a Eurodollar Advance under Section 2.2 or this Section 3.3, as the case may be, in connection with any borrowing of new Loans or expiration of an Eurodollar Interest Period with respect to any existing Eurodollar Advance, the amount of the Loans subject to such borrowing or such existing Eurodollar Advance shall thereafter be an ABR Advance until such time, if any, as the Borrower shall elect a new Eurodollar Advance pursuant to this Section 3.3,
(ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to select a Eurodollar Advance the Eurodollar Interest Period in respect of which ends later than the Maturity Date, and
(iii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to have more than five Eurodollar Advances outstanding at any one time, it being understood and agreed that each borrowing of Eurodollar Advances pursuant to a single Borrowing Request shall constitute the making of one Eurodollar Advance for the purpose of calculating such limitation.
SECTION 3.4
Interest Rates and Payment Dates
(a) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(b) and 3.4(c), the Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof at the applicable interest rate or rates per annum set forth below:
Prior to Maturity
 
 
(b) . After maturity, whether by acceleration, notice of intention to prepay or otherwise, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate 2% per annum until paid (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon). Any payment of principal, interest or any fees not paid on the date when due and payable shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate 2% per annum from the due date thereof until the date such payment is made (whether before or after the entry of any judgment thereon).
After Maturity, Late Payment Rate
plus
plus
(c) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at no time shall the interest rate payable to any Lender on any of its Loans, together with any fees and all other amounts payable hereunder to such Lender to the extent the same constitute or are deemed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. If in respect of any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to any Lender hereunder, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section 3.4) constitute or be deemed to constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an ""), then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of the Loans of such Lender, and (ii) if, in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts payable hereunder to such Lender in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender in respect of such period an amount (each a "") equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the aggregate sum of all Unqualified Amounts all other Compensatory Interest Payments.

(d) . Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, on the Expiration Date and, to the extent provided in Section 2.6(d), upon each prepayment of the Loans. Any change in the interest rate on the Loans resulting from an increase or a decrease in the Alternate Base Rate or any reserve requirement shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each change in the Prime Rate, but any failure to so notify shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay interest on the Loans in the amounts and on the dates set forth herein. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the Alternate Base Rate and the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent manifest error. The Borrower acknowledges that to the extent interest payable on the Loans is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such rate is only one of the bases for computing interest on loans made by the Lenders, and by basing interest payable on ABR Advances on the Alternate Base Rate, the Lenders have not committed to charge, and the Borrower has not in any way bargained for, interest based on a lower or the lowest rate at which the Lenders may now or in the future make extensions of credit to other Persons. All interest (other than interest calculated with reference to the Prime Rate) shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed, and all interest determined with reference to the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
General
 
SECTION 3.5
Indemnification for Loss
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if: (i) the Borrower shall fail to borrow a Eurodollar Advance or if the Borrower shall fail to Convert a Eurodollar Advance after it shall have given notice to do so in which it shall have requested a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.2 or 3.3, as the case may be, (ii) a Eurodollar Advance shall be terminated for any reason prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) any repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of a Eurodollar Advance is made for any reason on a date which is prior to the last day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto, or (iv) the Borrower shall have revoked a notice of prepayment or notice of termination of the Commitments that was conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the consummation of the issuance of long term Indebtedness or equity securities pursuant to Section 2.5 or 2.6, the Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against, and to pay on demand directly to such Lender the amount (calculated by such Lender using any method chosen by such Lender which is customarily used by such Lender for such purpose) equal to any loss or expense suffered by such Lender as a result of such failure to borrow or Convert, or such termination, repayment, prepayment or revocation, including any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the funding of such Eurodollar Advance or redeploying funds prepaid or repaid, in amounts which correspond to such Eurodollar Advance and any reasonable internal processing charge customarily charged by such Lender in connection therewith.
SECTION 3.6 .
Reimbursement for Costs, Etc
If at any time or from time to time there shall occur a Regulatory Change and any Lender shall have reasonably determined that such Regulatory Change (i) shall have had or will thereafter have the effect of reducing (A) the rate of return on such Lender's capital or the capital of any Person directly or indirectly owning or controlling such Lender (each a ""), or (B) the asset value (for capital purposes) to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of the Loans, or any participation therein, in any case to a level below that which such Lender or such Control Person could have achieved or would thereafter be able to achieve but for such Regulatory Change (after taking into account such Lender's or such Control Person's policies regarding capital), (ii) will impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, asset, special deposit or special assessment requirements on deposits obtained in the interbank eurodollar market in connection with the Loan Documents (excluding, with respect to any Eurodollar Advance, any such requirement which is included in the determination of the rate applicable thereto), (iii) will subject such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, to any tax (documentary, stamp or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement or any Note, or (iv) will change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or such Control Person, as applicable, of principal, interest or fees payable under the Loan Documents (except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) above, for any tax or changes in the rate of tax on such Lender's or such Control Person's net income) then, in each such case, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender or such Control Person, as the case may be, for any such reduction, reserve or other requirement, tax, loss, cost or expense (excluding general administrative and overhead costs) (collectively, "") attributable to such Lender's or such Control Person's compliance during the term hereof with such Regulatory Change. Each Lender may make multiple requests for compensation under this Section.
Control Person
Costs
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to compensate any Lender for any Costs under this Section 3.6 arising prior to 45 days preceding the date of demand, unless the applicable Regulatory Change giving rise to such Costs is imposed retroactively. In the case of retroactivity, such notice shall be provided to the Borrower not later than 45 days from the date that such Lender learned of such Regulatory Change. The Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender shall be contingent upon the provision of such timely notice (but any failure by such Lender to provide such timely notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to (i) Costs incurred from the date as of which such Regulatory Change became effective to the date that is 45 days after the date such Lender reasonably should have learned of such Regulatory Change and (ii) Costs incurred following the provision of such notice).
SECTION 3.7
Illegality of Funding
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any law, regulation, treaty or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof, and (a) the commitment of such Lender to make such Eurodollar Advances or Convert ABR Advances to such Eurodollar Advances shall forthwith be suspended, (b) such Lender shall fund its portion of each requested Eurodollar Advance as an ABR Advance and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as such Eurodollar Advances, if any, shall be Converted automatically to an ABR Advance on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto or at such earlier time as may be required. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section and such Lender shall have obtained actual knowledge that it is once again legal for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof and, upon receipt of such notice by each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, such Lender's commitment to make or maintain Eurodollar Advances shall be reinstated. If the commitment of any Lender with respect to Eurodollar Advances is suspended pursuant to this Section, such suspension shall not otherwise affect such Lender's Commitment.
SECTION 3.8
Option to Fund; Substituted Interest Rate
(a) Each Lender has indicated that, if the Borrower requests a Eurodollar Advance, such Lender may wish to purchase one or more deposits in order to fund or maintain its funding of its Pro Rata Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance during the Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto; it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to such funding are included only for the purpose of determining the rate of interest to be paid in respect of such Eurodollar Advance and any amounts owing under Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of each Eurodollar Advance in any manner it sees fit, but all such determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained its Pro Rata Percentage of each Eurodollar Advance
 
during the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period through the purchase of deposits in an amount equal to the amount of its Pro Rata Percentage of such Eurodollar Advance and having a maturity corresponding to such Eurodollar Interest Period. Each Lender may fund its Loans from or for the account of any branch or office of such Lender as such Lender may choose from time to time, subject to Section 3.10.
(b) In the event that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market either adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have notified the Administrative Agent that they have in good faith determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding loans bearing interest based on such Eurodollar Rate with respect to any portion of the Loans that the Borrower has requested be made as Eurodollar Advances or any Eurodollar Advance that will result from the requested conversion of any portion of the Loans into Eurodollar Advances (each, an ""), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders (by fax or other writing) of such determination on or, to the extent practicable, prior to the requested Borrowing Date or conversion date for such Affected Advances. If the Administrative Agent shall give such notice, (A) any Affected Advances shall be made as ABR Advances, (B) the Loans (or any portion thereof) that were to have been Converted to Affected Advances shall be Converted to or continued as ABR Advances, and (C) any outstanding Affected Advances shall be Converted, on the last day of the then current Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereto, to ABR Advances. Until any notice under clauses (i) or (ii), as the case may be, of this Section 3.8(b) has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (by notice to the Borrower) promptly upon either (x) the Administrative Agent having determined that such circumstances affecting the relevant market no longer exist and that adequate and reasonable means do exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 3.3, or (y) the Administrative Agent having been notified by such Required Lenders that circumstances no longer render the Loans (or any portion thereof) Affected Advances, no Eurodollar Advances shall be required to be made by the Lenders nor shall the Borrower have the right to Convert all or any portion of the Loans to Eurodollar Advances.
Affected Advance
SECTION 3.9
Certificates of Payment and Reimbursement
Each Lender agrees, in connection with any request by it for payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.6, to provide the Borrower with a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of any such payment or reimbursement. Each determination by each Lender of such payment or reimbursement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 3.10
Taxes; Net Payments
(a) All payments made by the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any taxes required by law to be withheld from any amounts payable under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Borrower is prohibited by law from making such payments free of deductions or withholdings, then
 
the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, as may be necessary in order that the actual amounts received by the Lenders in respect of interest and any other amounts payable under the Loan Documents after deduction or withholding (and after payment of any additional taxes or other charges due as a consequence of the payment of such additional amounts) shall equal the amount that would have been received if such deduction or withholding were not required. In the event that any such deduction or withholding can be reduced or nullified as a result of the application of any relevant double taxation convention, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will, at the expense of the Borrower, cooperate with the Borrower in making application to the relevant taxing authorities seeking to obtain such reduction or nullification, that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to (i) engage in any litigation, hearing or proceeding with respect thereto or (ii) disclose any tax return or other confidential information. If the Borrower shall make any payment under this Section or shall make any deduction or withholding from amounts paid under any Loan Document, the Borrower shall forthwith forward to the Administrative Agent original or certified copies of official receipts or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent establishing each such payment, deduction or withholding, as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent in turn shall distribute copies thereof to each Lender. If any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document is or becomes subject to any withholding, such Lender shall (unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority or as a result of any law, rule, regulation, order or similar directive applicable to such Lender) designate a different office or branch to which such payment is to be made from that initially selected thereby, if such designation would avoid such withholding and would not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender in any respect. In the event that any Lender determines that it received a refund or credit for taxes paid by the Borrower under this Section, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of such fact and shall remit to the Borrower the amount of such refund or credit applicable to the payments made by the Borrower in respect of such Lender under this Section.
provided
(b) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrower is liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required by the Internal Revenue Code.
SECTION 3.11 [Intentionally Omitted]
SECTION 3.12 [Intentionally Omitted]
SECTION 3.13
Replacement of Lender
If the Borrower is obligated to pay to any Lender any amount under Section 3.6 or 3.10, the Borrower shall have the right within 90 days thereafter, in accordance with the requirements
 
of Section 11.7(b), if no Default or Event of Default shall exist, to replace such Lender (the "") with one or more other assignees (each a ""), that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Acceptance Agreements pursuant to Section 11.7(b) (with the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 11.7(b) payable pursuant to said Section 11.7(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the Commitment (if any) and the outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay the following: (a) to the Replaced Lender, an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and (B) an amount equal to all accrued, but unpaid, fees owing to the Replaced Lender and (b) to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to all amounts owed by such Replaced Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender, a corresponding amount of which was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1 and which has not been repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Replaced Lender or the Borrower, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 3.13, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement that are intended to survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of the Loans.

provided
In order to induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, and the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders:
SECTION 4.1
Existence and Power
Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation (except, in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be in such good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect), has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect).
 
SECTION 4.2
Authority
The Borrower has full corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and perform the terms of the Loan Documents, all of which have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any applicable law or the terms of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. No consent or approval of, or other action by, shareholders of the Borrower, any Governmental Authority, or any other Person (which has not already been obtained) is required to authorize in respect of the Borrower, or is required in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or is required as a condition to the enforceability of the Loan Documents against the Borrower.
SECTION 4.3
Binding Agreement
The Loan Documents constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by equitable principles relating to the availability of specific performance as a remedy.
SECTION 4.4
Litigation
There are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document, or (b) which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document (it being understood that the Albertson's Acquisition is not a transaction contemplated by any Loan Document for purposes of this clause (b)).
SECTION 4.5
No Conflicting Agreements
(a) Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. No notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents.
(b) No provision of any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement or of any existing statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document. The execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the
 
terms of each Loan Document will not constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of, or obligation to create, any Lien upon the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or agreement.
SECTION 4.6
Taxes
The Borrower and each Subsidiary has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns, and has paid, or has made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or in any assessments made against them, the failure of which to file or pay could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and no tax Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 8.2) have been filed against the Borrower or any Subsidiary and no claims are being asserted with respect to such taxes which are required by GAAP to be reflected in the Financial Statements and are not so reflected, except for taxes which have been assessed but which are not yet due and payable. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower and each Subsidiary with respect to all federal, state, local and other taxes are considered by the management of the Borrower to be adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid assessment which (a) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or (b) is or might be due and payable against it or any Subsidiary or any Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such thereof as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, and for which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with GAAP or which have been assessed but are not yet due and payable.
SECTION 4.7
Compliance with Applicable Laws; Filings
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or decision of any Governmental Authority which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am general counsel of CVS Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), and have acted as such in connection with the Bridge Credit Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2006, by and among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent (the ""). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bridge Credit Agreement.
Borrower
Bridge Credit Agreement
I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering my opinions set forth below, I have assumed (i) the due authorization, execution and delivery by all parties thereto (other than the Borrower) of the Bridge Credit Agreement, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and (iii) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
ARTICLE 12 The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its Property and to carry on its business as now conducted.
ARTICLE 13 The Borrower is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real Property or in which the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified (except those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect).
ARTICLE 14 The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower.
ARTICLE 15 The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Bridge Credit Agreement and Notes do not require any action or approval on the part of the shareholders of the Borrower or any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official under United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of (i) United States federal law or the Delaware General Corporation Law, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or (iii) any existing material mortgage, material indenture, material contract or material agreement, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.
ARTICLE 16 The Bridge Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
ARTICLE 17 The Borrower is not an "investment company" (as such term is defined in the United States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended).
ARTICLE 18 To the best of my knowledge, there are no actions, suits, arbitration proceedings or claims (whether purportedly on behalf of the Borrower, any Subsidiary or otherwise) pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties, or maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect. To the best of my knowledge, there are no proceedings pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary (a) which call into question the validity or enforceability of, or otherwise seek to invalidate, any Loan Document or (b) which could reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect any of the transactions contemplated by any Loan Document.
ARTICLE 19 To the best of my knowledge, the Borrower is not in default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it or any of its Property is bound the effect of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect.
ARTICLE 20 To the best of my knowledge, no provision of any judgment, decree or order, in each case binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affecting the Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary conflicts with, or requires any consent which has not already been obtained under, or would in any way prevent the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of the terms of, any Loan Document.
The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications:
SECTION 20.1 I express no opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) in which any Lender is located which may limit the rate of interest that such Lender may charge or collect.
SECTION 20.2 I express no opinion as to provisions in the Bridge Credit Agreement which purport to create rights of set-off in favor of participants or which provide for set-off to be made otherwise than in accordance with applicable laws.
SECTION 20.3 I note that public policy considerations or court decisions may limit the rights of any party to obtain indemnification under the Bridge Credit Agreement.
I am a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the federal law of the United States of America and the Delaware General Corporation Law. For purposes of paragraph 5 of this opinion, I have assumed that, with your permission and without any research or investigation, the laws of the State of New York are identical to the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person without my prior written consent, except that any person that becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Bridge Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion as if it were specifically addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
