(b)

furnished to the Company by such Underwriter directly or through the Representatives, specifically for use therein (which information is specified in Section 12 hereof).
     
(c)
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     
(e)
The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 7.

record date
" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) for the Debt Securities of any series shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Registered Securities of such series established as contemplated by Section 2.03, or, if no such date is so established, the fifteenth day next preceding such interest payment date, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
     
Section 2.05
. Registrar and Paying Agent; Agents Generally.
The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Debt Securities may be presented for registration, registration of transfer or exchange (the "
Registrar
") and an office or agency where Debt Securities may be presented for payment (the "
Paying Agent
"), which shall be in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. The Company shall cause the Registrar to keep a register of the Registered Securities and of their registration, transfer and exchange (the "
Security Register
"). The Company may have one or more additional Paying Agents or transfer agents with respect to any series.
     
The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act that relate to such Agent. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address of any Agent and any change in the name or address of an Agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company may remove any Agent upon written notice to such Agent and the Trustee; provided that no such removal shall become effective until (i) the acceptance of an appointment by a successor Agent to such Agent as evidenced by an appropriate agency agreement entered into by the Company and such successor Agent and delivered to the Trustee or (ii) notification to the Trustee that the Trustee shall serve as such Agent until the appointment of a successor Agent in
accordance with clause (i) of this proviso. The Company or any affiliate of the Company may act as Paying Agent or Registrar; provided that neither the Company nor an affiliate of the Company shall act as Paying Agent in connection with the defeasance of the Debt Securities or the discharge of this Indenture under Article 8.
     
The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar, Paying Agent and Authenticating Agent. If, at any time, the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Registrar shall make available to the Trustee ten days prior to each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may reasonably request the names and addresses of the Holders as they appear in the Security Register.
     
Section 2.06
. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.
Not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of any Principal or interest on any Debt Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money in immediately available funds sufficient to pay such Principal or interest. The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such Debt Securities or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of Principal of and interest on such Debt Securities and shall promptly notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and account for any funds disbursed, and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any payment default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money so paid over to the Trustee. If the Company or any affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it will, on or before each due date of any Principal of or interest on any Debt Securities, segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders thereof a sum of money sufficient to pay such Principal or interest so becoming due until such sum of money shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as provided in this Indenture, and will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of its action or failure to act as required by this Section.
     
Section 2.07
. Transfer and Exchange.
Unregistered Securities (except for any temporary global Unregistered Securities) and coupons (except for coupons attached to any temporary global Unregistered Securities) shall be transferable by delivery.
     
At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of any series (other than a Registered Global Security, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a Registered Security or Registered Securities of such series and tenor having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Registered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Company that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 2.05 and upon payment, if the Company shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. If the Debt Securities of any series are issued in both registered and unregistered form, except as otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.03, at the option of the Holder thereof, Unregistered Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of such series and tenor having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon
surrender of such Unregistered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Company that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 4.02, with, in the case of Unregistered Securities that have coupons attached, all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining, and upon payment, if the Company shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. At the option of the Holder thereof, if Unregistered Securities of any series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date are issued in more than one authorized denomination, except as otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.03, such Unregistered Securities may be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series and tenor having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Unregistered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Company that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 4.02, with, in the case of Unregistered Securities that have coupons attached, all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining, and upon payment, if the Company shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Registered Securities of any series may not be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series. Whenever any Debt Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, the Debt Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     
All Registered Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     
The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
     
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.07, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in definitive registered form, a Registered Global Security representing all or a portion of the Debt Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     
If at any time the Depositary for any Registered Global Securities of any series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Registered Global Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Registered Global Securities shall no longer be eligible under applicable law, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law with respect to such Registered Global Securities. If (i) a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law for such Registered Global Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the
Depositary for the issuance of definitive Registered Securities in exchange for Registered Global Securities, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Company's written order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Registered Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and make available for delivery Registered Securities of such series and tenor, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Registered Global Securities, in exchange for such Registered Global Securities and such Registered Global Securities shall be canceled.
     
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that any Registered Global Securities of any series shall no longer be maintained in global form. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Company's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Registered Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and make available for delivery, Registered Securities of such series and tenor in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Registered Global Securities, in exchange for such Registered Global Securities.
     
Any time the Registered Securities of any series are not in the form of Registered Global Securities pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs, the Company agrees to supply the Trustee with a reasonable supply of certificated Registered Securities without the legend required by Section 2.02 and the Trustee agrees to hold such Registered Securities in safekeeping until authenticated and delivered pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
     
If established by the Company pursuant to Section 2.03 with respect to any Registered Global Security, the Depositary for such Registered Global Security may surrender such Registered Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of the same series and tenor in definitive registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and upon the written order of the Company the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, without service charge,
     
(i) to the Person specified by such Depositary new Registered Securities of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Registered Global Security; and
     
(ii) to such Depositary a new Registered Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Registered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
     
Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Registered Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.07 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Registered Global Security, pursuant to
instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Company or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Debt Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities are so registered.
     
All Debt Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Debt Securities shall be valid, legally binding obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     
Notwithstanding anything herein or in the forms or terms of any Debt Securities to the contrary, none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered Security if such exchange would result in adverse Federal income tax consequences to the Company (such as, for example, the inability of the Company to deduct from its income, as computed for Federal income tax purposes, the interest payable on the Unregistered Securities) under then applicable United States Federal income tax laws. The Trustee and any such agent shall be entitled to rely on an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel in determining such result.
     
The Registrar shall not be required (i) to issue, authenticate, register the transfer of or exchange Debt Securities of any series for a period of 15 days before a selection of such Debt Securities to be redeemed or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Security selected for redemption in whole or in part.
     
Section 2.08
. Replacement Debt Securities.
If a defaced or mutilated Debt Security of any series is surrendered to the Trustee or if a Holder claims that its Debt Security of any series has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and upon the written order of the Company the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Debt Security of such series and tenor and principal amount bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. An indemnity bond must be furnished that is sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee and any Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Debt Security is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its expenses and the expenses of the Trustee (including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses) in replacing a Debt Security. In case any such mutilated, defaced, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Debt Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may pay such Debt Security instead of issuing a new Debt Security in replacement thereof.
     
Every replacement Debt Security is an additional obligation of the Company and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     
To the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions of this Section are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Debt Securities.
     
Section 2.09
. Outstanding Debt Securities.
Debt Securities outstanding at any time are all Debt Securities that have been authenticated by the Trustee except for those Debt Securities canceled by it, those Debt Securities delivered to it for cancellation, those Debt Securities paid pursuant to Section 2.08 and those Debt Securities described in this Section as not outstanding.
     
If a Debt Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless and until the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Debt Security is held by a holder in due course.
     
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company or an affiliate of the Company) holds on the maturity date or any redemption date or date for repurchase of the Debt Securities money sufficient to pay Debt Securities payable or to be redeemed or repurchased on such date, then on and after such date such Debt Securities shall cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease to accrue.
     
A Debt Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or one of its affiliates holds such Debt Security,
provided, however
, that, in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities shall have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Debt Securities owned by the Company or any affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Debt Securities as to which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Any Debt Securities so owned which are pledged by the Company, or by any affiliate of the Company, as security for loans or other obligations, otherwise than to another such affiliate of the Company, shall be deemed to be outstanding, if the pledgee is entitled pursuant to the terms of its pledge agreement and is free to exercise in its discretion the right to vote such Debt Securities, uncontrolled by the Company or by any such affiliate.
     
Section 2.10
. Temporary Debt Securities.
Until definitive Debt Securities of any series are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and upon the written order of the Company the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Debt Securities of such series. Temporary Debt Securities of any series shall be substantially in the form of definitive Debt Securities of such series but may have insertions, substitutions, omissions and other variations determined to be appropriate by the Officers executing the temporary Debt Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such temporary Debt Securities. If temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of any series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series and tenor upon surrender of such temporary Debt Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 4.02, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debt Securities of any series the Company shall execute and upon the written order of the Company the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery in exchange therefor a like principal
amount of definitive Debt Securities of such series and tenor and authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Debt Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of such series.
     
Section 2.11
. Cancellation.
The Company at any time may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Debt Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Debt Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold. The Registrar, any transfer agent and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Debt Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Debt Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and shall deliver such canceled Debt Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue new Debt Securities to replace Debt Securities it has paid in full or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
     
Section 2.12
. CUSIP Numbers.
The Company in issuing the Debt Securities may use "CUSIP" and "ISIN" numbers (if then generally in use), and the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders and no representation shall be made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Debt Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption or exchange. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP Numbers.
     
Section 2.13
. Defaulted Interest.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Debt Securities, it shall pay, or shall deposit with the Paying Agent money in immediately available funds sufficient to pay, the defaulted interest plus (to the extent lawful) any interest payable on the defaulted interest (as may be specified in the terms thereof, established pursuant to Section 2.03) to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, which shall mean the 15th day next preceding the date fixed by the Company for the payment of defaulted interest, whether or not such day is a Business Day. At least 15 days before such special record date, the Company shall mail to each Holder and to the Trustee a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
     
Section 2.14
. Series May Include Tranches.
A series of Debt Securities may include one or more tranches (each a "
tranche
") of Debt Securities, including Debt Securities issued in a Periodic Offering. The Debt Securities of different tranches may have one or more different terms, including authentication dates and public offering prices, but all the Debt Securities within each such tranche shall have identical terms, including authentication date and public offering price. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, with respect to Sections 2.02 (other than the fourth paragraph thereof) through 2.04, 2.07, 2.08, 2.10, 3.01 through 3.05, 4.02, 6.01 through 6.12, 8.01 through 8.06 and 9.02, if any series of Debt Securities includes more than one tranche, all provisions of such sections applicable to any series of Debt Securities shall be deemed equally applicable to each tranche of any series of Debt Securities in the same manner as though originally designated a series unless otherwise provided with respect to such
series or tranche pursuant to Section 2.03. In particular, and without limiting the scope of the next preceding sentence, any of the provisions of such sections which provide for or permit action to be taken with respect to a series of Debt Securities shall also be deemed to provide for and permit such action to be taken instead only with respect to Debt Securities of one or more tranches within that series (and such provisions shall be deemed satisfied thereby), even if no comparable action is taken with respect to Debt Securities in the remaining tranches of that series.
     
Section 2.15
. Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.03 for Debt Securities of any series, interest on the Debt Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     
Section 3.01
. Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Debt Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Debt Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.03 for Debt Securities of such series.
     
Section 3.02
. Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions.
Notice of redemption to the Holders of Registered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Company shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Registered Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register of the Company. Notice of redemption to the Holders of Unregistered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part, who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act, shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption, by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee (and, in the case of any such notice given by the Company, the Trustee shall make such information available to the Company for such purpose). Notice of redemption to all other Holders of Unregistered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part shall be published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and in an Authorized Newspaper in London, in each case, once in each of three successive calendar weeks, the first publication to be not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Any notice which is mailed or published in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Security of such series.
     
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Debt Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the CUSIP and
ISIN numbers of the Debt Securities to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities and, in the case of Debt Securities with coupons attached thereto, of all coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Debt Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Debt Security, a new Debt Security or Securities of such series and tenor in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
     
The notice of redemption of Debt Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company; provided however if the Trustee is asked to give the Notice, the Company will give the Trustee five Business Days prior notice if such request.
     
On or before 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 2.06) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Debt Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If all of the outstanding Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given to Holders pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 3.02 (or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate stating that all such Debt Securities are to be redeemed. If less than all the outstanding Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given to Holders pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 3.02 (or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such Debt Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Company prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officers' Certificate stating that such redemption is not prohibited by such restriction.
     
If less than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, pro rata, by lot or in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Debt Securities of such series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Debt Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debt Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in
the case of any Debt Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities shall relate, in the case of any Debt Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     
Section 3.03
. Payment of Debt Securities Called for Redemption.
If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Debt Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to such date) interest on the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and the unmatured coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be void and, except as provided in Sections 7.11 and 8.05, such Debt Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Debt Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, said Debt Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption;
provided
that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable in the case of Debt Securities with coupons attached thereto, to the Holders of the coupons for such interest upon surrender thereof, and in the case of Registered Securities, to the Holders of such Registered Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.04 and 2.13 hereof.
     
If any Debt Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the Principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Debt Security) borne by such Debt Security.
     
If any Debt Security with coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee, if there be furnished to each of them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them harmless.
     
Upon presentation of any Debt Security of any series redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and upon the written order of the Company the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Debt Security or Securities of such series and tenor
(with any unmatured coupons attached), of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Debt Security so presented.
     
Section 3.04
. Exclusion of Certain Debt Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption.
Debt Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in a written statement signed by an Officer of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company.
     
Section 3.05
. Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "
mandatory sinking fund payment,
" and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of the Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "
optional sinking fund payment.
" The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "
sinking fund payment date.
"
     
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Debt Securities in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except through a mandatory sinking fund payment) by the Company or receive credit for Debt Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Debt Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Company through any optional sinking fund payment. Debt Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Debt Securities.
     
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of specified Debt Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the specified Debt Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Company intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Debt Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Company to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall
be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11 to the Trustee with such Officers' Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officers' Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Company shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or delivery of Debt Securities therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Debt Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Debt Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
     
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Debt Securities of any series), such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price thereof together with accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or such lesser sum) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser sum) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Debt Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Company) inform the Company of the serial numbers of the Debt Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Debt Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officers' Certificate as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company (or the Company, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Debt Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 3.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 3.03) for the redemption of Debt Securities of such series in part at the option of the Company. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Debt Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the Principal of, and interest on, the Debt Securities of such series at maturity.
     
On or before 10:00 a.m. New York City time on each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Debt Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
     
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Debt Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Debt Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Debt Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 6 and held for the payment of all such Debt Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 6.04 or the Default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Debt Securities.
     
Section 4.01
. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
The Company shall duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each series of Debt Securities in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Debt Securities of such series. Unless otherwise specified in any series of Debt Securities, interest on the Debt Securities of each series will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
     
Section 4.02
. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
The Company shall maintain an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where any series of Debt Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debt Securities of such series and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in such location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
     
The Company also from time to time may designate one or more additional offices or agencies where the Debt Securities of any series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and from time to time may rescind any such
designation; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
     
Section 4.03
. Reports By The Company.
So long as the Debt Securities of any series are outstanding, the Company will file with the Trustee such information, documents and other reports as may be required to comply with the provisions of TIA  314(a),
provided
that (i) any failure of the Company to comply with this provision shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default and (ii) only the Trustee may institute a legal proceeding against the Company to enforce such delivery obligation.
     
Delivery of such information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
     
Section 4.04
. Restrictions on Secured Funded Debt.

(vi) Liens incurred or assumed in connection with the issuance of revenue bonds the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to Section 103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;
     
(vii) Liens securing the performance of any contract or undertaking not directly or indirectly in connection with the borrowing of money, the obtaining of advances or credit or the securing of Indebtedness, if made and continuing in the ordinary course of business;
     
(viii) Liens incurred (no matter when created) in connection with the Company's or a Restricted Subsidiary's engaging in leveraged or single-investor lease transactions; provided, however, that the instrument creating or evidencing any borrowings secured by such Lien will provide that such borrowings are payable solely out of the income and proceeds of the property subject to such Lien and are not a general obligation of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary;
     
(ix) Liens in favor of a governmental agency to qualify the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to do business, maintain self insurance or obtain other benefits, or Liens under workers' compensation laws, unemployment insurance laws or similar legislation;

(xv) Liens incurred to finance all or any portion of the cost of construction, alteration or repair of any Principal Property or improvements thereto created prior to or within 360 days (or thereafter if such Lien is created pursuant to a binding commitment to lend entered into prior to, at the time of, or within 360 days) after completion of such construction, alteration or repair;

Section 4.05
. Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions.
The Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (which lease is required by GAAP to be capitalized on the balance sheet of such lessee), which Principal Property has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to such person (a "
Sale and Leaseback Transaction
") unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all Attributable Debt with respect to all such Sale and Leaseback
Transactions plus all Secured Debt (with the exception of Funded Debt secured by Liens which is excluded pursuant to clauses 4.04(i) to 4.04(xviii) of Section 4.04) would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

(iii) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary applies the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the Principal Property leased pursuant to such transaction to the purchase of assets (and the cost of construction thereof) within 360 days prior or subsequent to such sale or transfer;
     
(iv) the effective date of any such arrangement or the purchaser's commitment therefor is within 36 months prior or subsequent to the acquisition of the Principal Property (including, without limitation, acquisition by merger or consolidation) or the completion of construction and commencement of operation thereof (which, in the case of a retail store, is the date of opening to the public), whichever is later;
     
(v) the lease in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is for a term, including renewals, of not more than three years;

(ii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and an opinion of counsel as to the matters set forth in paragraph 5.01(i) above.

Each of the following shall constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to each series of Debt Securities individually:

(ii) the Company defaults in the payment of any interest on the Debt Securities of such series when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
     
(iii) the Company defaults in the performance of or breaches any other covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture (other than any covenant or agreement in this Indenture that expressly provides that a violation of such covenant or agreement shall not constitute an Event of Default) and such default or breach continues for a period of 60 consecutive days after written notice thereof has been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the
Trustee by the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series;
     
(iv) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company with respect to the Company or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect seeking the appointment or a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or for any substantial part of the property and assets of the Company, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 days; or an order for relief shall be entered against the Company under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect;
     
(v) the Company (1) commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, (2) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company or (3) effects any general assignment for the benefit of creditors;
     
(vi) an event of default as defined in any one or more indentures or instruments evidencing or under which the Company has at the date of this Indenture or shall thereafter have outstanding an aggregate of at least $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money, shall happen and be continuing and such indebtedness shall have been accelerated so that the same shall be or become due and payable prior to the date on which the same would otherwise have become due and payable and such acceleration shall not be rescinded or annulled within ten days after notice thereof shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee (if such event be known to it), or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series at the time outstanding; provided that if such event of default under such indentures or instruments shall be remedied or cured by the Company or waived by the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of Default under this clause 6.01(vi) shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the Holders of such series; and
     
(vii) failure by the Company to make any payment at maturity, including any applicable grace period, in respect of at least $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money and such failure shall have continue for a period of ten days after notice thereof shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee (if such event be known to it), or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series at the time outstanding; provided that if such failure shall be remedied or cured by the Company or waived by the holders of such indebtedness, then the Event of Default under this clause 6.01(vii) shall be
deemed likewise to have been thereupon remedied, cured or waived without further action upon the part of either the Trustee or any of the Holders of such series.
     
The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
     
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default pursuant to clause 6.01(iii), clause 6.01(iv), clause 6.01(v), clause 6.01(vi), or clause 6.01(vii) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
     
Section 6.02
. Acceleration.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series then outstanding by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), may declare the entire outstanding principal amount of all Debt Securities of such series, and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be immediately due and payable (collectively, the "Default Amount"). Upon such a declaration, the Default Amount shall be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of an Event of Default specified in clause 6.01(iv) or clause 6.01(v) of Section 6.01 with respect to a series of Debt Securities, then the principal amount of all the Debt Securities of such series then outstanding and interest accrued thereon, if any, shall be and become immediately due and payable, without any notice or other action by any Holder of the Debt Securities of such series or the Trustee to the full extent permitted by applicable law. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities of such series by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
     
Section 6.03
. Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Debt Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Debt Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Debt Securities of such series and this Indenture.
     
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Debt Securities of such series or does not produce any such Debt Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Debt Security of such series in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Event of
Default. No remedy shall be exclusive of any other remedy. All remedies shall be cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
     
Section 6.04
. Waiver of Past Defaults.
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series, by notice to the Trustee, may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except (i) a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Debt Securities of such series as specified in clauses 6.01(i) or 6.01(ii) of Section 6.01 or (ii) a Default in respect of a covenant or provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Debt Securities of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
     
Section 6.05
. Control by Majority.
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee by this Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities of such series; provided that the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that, subject to Section 7.01 may involve the Trustee in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be prejudicial to the rights of Holders of such series not joining in the giving of such direction; and provided further that the Trustee may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any directions received from Holders of Debt Securities of such series pursuant to this Section 6.05.
     
Section 6.06
. Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Debt Securities of any series may institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or the Debt Securities of such series, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy under this Indenture, unless:
     
(i) such Holder has previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
     
(ii) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities of such series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under the Indenture;
     
(iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any costs, liabilities or expenses to be incurred in compliance with such request;
     
(iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     
(v) during such 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of such series have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such written request.
     
A Holder of Debt Securities of any series may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of such series or to obtain a preference or priority over such other Holder.
     
Section 6.07
. Unconditional Right of Holders of Debt Securities to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Debt Security to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Debt Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Debt Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of any such Holder of a Debt Security.
     
Section 6.08
. Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(i) or Section 6.01(ii) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the entire amount then due and owing, plus the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.
     
Section 6.09
. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, the Company's creditors or the Company's property, and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders of Debt Securities in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of a Debt Security to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Debt Securities, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Debt Security any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt Securities or the rights of any Holder of a Debt Security thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Debt Security in any such proceeding.

(e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Trustee shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     
(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company.
     
(g) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; and
     
(j) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith which it reasonably believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
     
(e) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by the Trustee hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.
     
(f) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Debt Securities and this Indenture.

Section 7.03
. Individual Rights of Trustee.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Debt Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company with the same rights as it would have if the Trustee were not the Trustee hereunder. However, in the event the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest in accordance with the TIA it must eliminate such conflicting interest within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee or resign.

Section 7.04

If a Default occurs and is continuing with respect to a series of Debt Securities and if such Default is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of a Debt Security of such series a notice of such Default within 90 days (or such shorter period as may be required by applicable law) after such Default occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Debt Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Debt Securities.
     
Section 7.06
. Reports by Trustee to Holders of Debt Securities.
Within 60 days after each May 15, beginning with May 15 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of the Debt Securities a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA  313(a) to the extent such a report is required by TIA  313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b).
     
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Debt Securities shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on which the Debt Securities may be listed. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee upon the Debt Securities being listed on any stock exchange and any delisting thereof.
     
Section 7.07
. Compensation and Indemnity.
The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall agree to in writing from time to time for the Trustee's acceptance of this Indenture and its
services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it in the course of its services hereunder. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts.
     
The Company shall indemnify the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense, including taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee), incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties under this Indenture, except any such loss, liability or expense determined to have been caused by negligence, or willful misconduct of the Trustee.
     
The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Company may be materially prejudiced by such failure. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense of such claim. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
     
The Company's payment obligations under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

If the Trustee shall incur expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(iv) or Section 6.01(v), such expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under Bankruptcy Law.
      The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture.
     
Section 7.08
. Replacement of Trustee.
A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.
     
The Trustee may resign at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of Debt Securities of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series then
outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
     
If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
     
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of Debt Securities of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Debt Securities of any series may petition at the expense of the Company any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     
If the Trustee after written request by any Holder of a Debt Security who has been a Holder of a Debt Security for at least six months fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder of a Debt Security may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     
Any successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all of the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders of Debt Securities. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
     
Section 7.09

In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of
the Debt Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee, and deliver such Debt Securities so authenticated, and in case at that time any of the Debt Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Debt Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Debt Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
     
Section 7.10

The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
     
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Debt Securities of any series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Debt Securities of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(iii) .
     
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and at the request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations of the Company terminated thereby.
     
(c) Notwithstanding clause (a) and clause (b) above, the Company' obligations contained in Section 2.02, Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Section 2.06, Section 2.07, Section 7.07, Section 7.08 and this Article 8 shall survive until the Debt Securities of such series have been paid in full.

S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient (unless such funds consist solely of money, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee) without consideration of any reinvestment and after payment of all federal, state and local taxes or other charges and assessments in respect thereof payable by the Trustee, to pay and discharge the principal of and accrued interest on the outstanding Debt Securities of such series to maturity or earlier redemption (irrevocably provided for under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee), as the case may be;
     
(ii) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound;
     
(iii) no Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;
     
(iv) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that (1) the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred and (2) the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series have a valid security interest in the trust funds; and
     
(v) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating that all conditions precedent herein provided relating to the defeasance contemplated by this Section have been complied with.

Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of the Debt Securities of such series at a future date in accordance with Article 3.
     
Section 8.03
. Application of Trust Money.
The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8.

Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be contained therein, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture which adversely affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
     
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Debt Securities of any series affected thereby a notice briefly describing any such amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Section 6.04 and Section 6.07, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series then outstanding may waive compliance by the Company in any particular instance with any provision of this Indenture or the Debt Securities of such series.
     
Section 9.02
. With Consent of Holders of Debt Securities.
The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Debt Securities of any series or any amended or supplemental Indenture with the written consent of the Holders of Debt Securities of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series then outstanding, and any existing Default and its consequences or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Debt Securities of such series may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series then outstanding. However, without the consent of each Holder of a Debt Security of such series affected, any amendment, supplement or waiver may not:
     
(i) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, such Holder's Debt Securities, or reduce the principal thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or any premium payable with respect thereto, or change any place or currency of payment where any Debt Security of such series or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the due date therefor;
     
(ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities of such series the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain Defaults hereunder and their consequences provided for in this Indenture;
     
(iii) waive a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Debt Security of such Holder; or
     
(iv) modify any of the provisions of this Section, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Debt Security of such series thereunder affected thereby.
     
Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory with the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series as aforesaid and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
     
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series affected thereby a notice briefly describing any such amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver.
     
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless such consent shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by an Holder be cancelled and of no further effect.
     
Section 9.03
. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.

Section 9.04
. Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver by a Holder of a Debt Security of any series is a continuing and binding consent by the Holder of a Debt Security of such series and every subsequent Holder of a Debt Security of such series or portion of a Debt Security of such series that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Debt Security, even if a notation of
the consent or waiver is not made on any Debt Security. However, any such Holder of a Debt Security of such series or subsequent Holder of a Debt Security of such series may revoke the consent as to its Debt Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver shall become effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter shall bind every Holder of a Debt Security of such series.
     
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Debt Securities of any series entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, such Persons which were Holders of Debt Securities of such series at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders of Debt Securities of such series after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
     
Section 9.05
. Notation On or Exchange of Debt Securities.
If an amendment or supplement changes the terms of a Debt Security of any series, the Trustee may require the Holder of such Debt Security to deliver such Debt Security to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Debt Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder of such Debt Security. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for such Debt Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Debt Security that reflects such changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Debt Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment or supplement.
