Item 8.01  Other Events
 
Set forth below are the certified voting results for the matters submitted to a vote of shareholders at the Companys Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 9, 2007.  These voting results are being provided in this Current Report since certification of the results by the inspector of election for the Annual Meeting was completed on May 15, 2007 and the results therefore were not announced at the Annual Meeting.
For the 2007 Annual Meeting:
Total eligible votes were 1,518,068,830;
Total votes cast were 1,091,672,488; and
Percentage of total eligible votes voted (i.e., quorum) was 71.91%.
Each director is elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to that directors election (by the holders of shares of common stock and ESOP preference stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote, voting as a single class).  Votes against a directors election count as a vote cast, but abstentions and broker non-votes do not count as a vote cast with respect to that directors election.
 
 
 
As indicated above, Proxy Item 6 (Stockholder proposal regarding separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO) received majority support of the votes cast.  While this shareholder vote is non-binding, the Companys Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review this matter fully and give careful consideration to an appropriate response.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
