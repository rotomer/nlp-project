As previously disclosed by CVS Caremark Corporation (the "Company"), in June 2005 the enforcement staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") commenced an inquiry into matters related to the accounting for a transaction that occurred in 2000 (the "2000 Transaction"). Pursuant to the 2000 Transaction, the Company (i) made accounting entries reflecting the conveyance of certain excess plush toy collectible inventory to a third party; (ii) received a total of $42.5 million in barter credits; and (iii) made a cash payment of $12.5 million to the same third party.
Today, the SEC announced that it had reached a settlement with the Company resolving the SEC's investigation. Pursuant to the settlement, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Company consented to the entry of an administrative order that (i) finds violations of certain books and records provisions of the federal securities laws; and (ii) requires that the Company cease and desist from committing any future violations of the provisions charged.
The Company is pleased that this matter could be resolved on an administrative basis and is now officially behind it.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
