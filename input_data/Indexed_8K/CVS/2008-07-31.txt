Second Quarter Year-Over-Year Highlights:
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, July 31, 2008 - CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced record revenues, operating profit, and earnings for the second quarter ended June 28, 2008.
Revenues:
Net revenues for the second quarter ended June 28, 2008, increased $437.0 million to $21.1 billion, up from $20.7 billion during the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Revenues in the retail drugstore segment increased 4.6% to $11.8 billion in the second quarter, while same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) in the Company's CVS/pharmacy division for the second quarter rose 3.1% over the prior year period. Pharmacy same store sales rose 3.7% and were negatively impacted by approximately 280 basis points due to recent generic introductions, while front-end same store sales increased 1.8%. Same store sales for the second quarter were negatively impacted by an earlier Easter, which shifted more holiday sales into March. The Company estimates the Easter shift had a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points on front-end same store sales for the quarter ended June 28, 2008.
Revenues in the pharmacy services segment increased 1.0% to $10.7 billion in the second quarter ended June 28, 2008. Retail network claims processed during the second quarter ended June 28, 2008, increased 2.7% to 136.3 million compared to 132.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in retail network claims was driven primarily by increased enrollment in the Medicare Part D business. Mail service claims processed during the second quarter ended June 28, 2008 decreased 18.9% to 15.0 million compared to 18.5 million in the prior year period primarily due to the termination of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan mail contract effective December 31, 2007.
Earnings from continuing operations:
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter ended June 28, 2008, increased 13.8% to $823.5 million or $0.56 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $723.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the comparable 2007 period. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $97.8 million in amortization of intangible assets primarily related to acquisition activity, for the second quarter were $0.60, compared with $0.51 per share in the comparable 2007 period. Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 28, 2008, increased 38.8% to $1,572.0 million or $1.07 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $1,132.5 million or $0.91 per diluted share in the comparable 2007 period. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $195.7 million in amortization of intangible assets primarily related to acquisition activity, for the six months were $1.15, compared with $0.99 per share in the comparable 2007 period.
Tom Ryan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CVS Caremark said, "This was another quarter of strong financial performance across our businesses. We delivered solid improvement in sales and gross margins and continued to exercise disciplined expense control. That enabled us to hit a record operating profit margin this quarter. At the same time, we've further advanced our new PBM/retail model and our clients have expressed growing enthusiasm for our unique new product offerings."
Loss from discontinued operations:
In connection with business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company continues to guarantee store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens n Things ("Linens"). On May 2, 2008, Linens Holding Co., which operates Linens, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. As a result, CVS Caremark reported a $48.7 million net loss, or $0.03 per diluted share, from discontinued operations for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 28, 2008. The net loss from discontinued operations consists of lease-related costs (net of income tax benefit), which the Company may be required to satisfy pursuant to the guarantee of certain Linens' store lease obligations.
Real estate program
For the quarter, CVS Caremark opened 49 new retail pharmacy stores, closed 8 retail pharmacy stores, and relocated 39 others. As of June 28, 2008, the Company operated 6,308 retail pharmacy stores, 56 specialty pharmacy stores, 19 specialty mail order pharmacies and 7 mail order pharmacies in 44 states and the District of Columbia.

For internal comparisons, management finds it useful to assess year-to-year performance adjusting diluted earnings per share for amortization, which primarily relates to acquisition activities.
The Company defines adjusted earnings per share as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus amortization, less income tax provision and dilutive earnings adjustment, divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.
Following is a reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision to adjusted earnings per share:
 
The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to properties and equipment (additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions).
Following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 
The Company evaluates segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of discontinued operations and certain intersegment activities and charges. Following is a reconciliation of the Company's business segments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements:

The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (and excluding merger and integration related costs). We define EBITDA per adjusted claim as EBITDA divided by adjusted pharmacy claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims normalize the claims volume statistic for the difference in average days' supply for mail and retail claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims are calculated by multiplying 90-day claims (the majority of total mail claims) by 3 and adding the 30-day claims. EBITDA can be reconciled to operating profit, which we believe to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
Following is a reconciliation of operating profit to EBITDA:
