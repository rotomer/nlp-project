Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 23, 2008, the Board of Directors of CVS Caremark Corporation (the "Company") approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from the Saturday nearest December 31 of each year to December 31 of each year. Company management previously discussed during quarterly earnings announcements the desire to make this change, which was subject to Board approval, to better reflect the Company's position in the healthcare, rather than retail, industry.
The fiscal year change is effective beginning with the Company's 2008 fiscal year, which will now end on December 31, 2008. The Company's Form 10-K for fiscal 2008 will cover the period from December 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Prior to Board approval of this change, the Saturday nearest December 31, 2008 would have resulted in a 53-week fiscal year that would have ended January 3, 2009. The Company's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2009 will now cover the period from January 1, 2009 to March 31, 2009.
