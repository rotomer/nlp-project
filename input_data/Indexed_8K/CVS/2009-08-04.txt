Second Quarter Year-Over-Year Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, August 4, 2009 - CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS), today announced revenues, operating profit, and earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Revenues:
Net revenues for the second quarter of 2009, increased $3.7 billion to $24.9 billion, up from $21.1 billion during the second quarter of 2008.
Revenues in the pharmacy services segment increased 22.1% to $13.0 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusting the growth rate for the impact of new generics, net revenues would have grown 26.2% in the pharmacy services segment. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company converted a number of RxAmerica retail pharmacy network contracts, which resulted in those contracts being accounted for using the gross method which increased net revenues. Retail network claims processed during the second quarter of 2009 increased 8.8% to 148.3 million, compared to 136.3 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the addition of RxAmerica claims and claims that were filled at retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice program. This was offset by a reduction in claims due to the termination of two large health plan clients effective January 1, 2009. Mail service claims processed during the second quarter of 2009 increased 5.3% to 15.8 million compared to 15.0 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of net new client starts offset by a shift of participants toward the Company's Maintenance Choice program.
Revenues in the retail pharmacy segment increased 17.2% to $13.8 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) increased 6.1% over the prior year period. Pharmacy same store sales rose 7.5% and were negatively impacted by approximately 478 basis points due to recent generic introductions, while front store same store sales increased 3.0%. Front store revenues were positively impacted by a later Easter (April 12
th
this year versus March 23
rd
last year), which shifted more holiday sales into the second quarter of 2009. The Company estimates the Easter shift had a positive impact of approximately 135 basis points on front store same store sales for the second quarter of 2009 and approximately 45 basis points on total same store sales. Front store revenues were also positively impacted by approximately 85 basis points as a result of product cost increases in advance of the federal cigarette excise tax increase.
The generic dispensing rate in our pharmacy services segment increased 330 basis points to a best-in-class 67.8% in the second quarter. At the same time, the generic dispensing rate in our retail segment increased approximately 260 basis points to 69.6%.
Earnings from continuing operations:
Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, increased 8.0% to $889.1 million, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $823.5 million during the second quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $107.3 million of intangible asset amortization related to acquisition activity, for the second quarter were $0.65, compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of 2008. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2009 were $0.60, compared with $0.56 in the second quarter of 2008. Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009, increased 3.9% to $1.63 billion, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $1.57 billion during the six months ended June 28, 2008. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $214.8 million of intangible asset amortization related to acquisition activity, for the six months ended June 30, 2009, were $1.20, compared with $1.15 in the six months ended June 28, 2008. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009 were $1.11, compared with $1.07 in the six months ended June 28, 2008.
The Company's reported results include the impact of the Longs business, which has a lower operating margin, as well as integration expenses incurred related to the Longs acquisition. Additionally, reported expenses include the impact of the elimination of the joint venture with Universal American, the income from which was historically recorded as an offset to expenses.
Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, said "I'm very pleased with our second quarter results, which were at the high end of our expectations. We saw solid revenue growth and cost control across our businesses, which led to 8% operating profit growth after one-time costs for the Longs integration. This is shaping up to be a very good year and we expect an even better 2010."
Dave Rickard, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, said, "Given our strong performance year to date as well as our optimism for the rest of the year, we're raising our earnings guidance and narrowing the range. We now expect to deliver Adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.59 - $2.64 for the year, up from our previous guidance of $2.55 - $2.63. GAAP EPS from continuing operations is projected at $2.41 - $2.46, up from our previous guidance of $2.37 - $2.45."
Loss from discontinued operations:
In connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997, the Company continues to guarantee store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens n Things. The Company's loss from discontinued operations for the second quarter of 2009 includes $2.6 million ($4.3 million, net of a $1.7 million income tax benefit) of lease-related costs (i.e., interest accretion and legal fees). The loss from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2009 includes $7.7 million ($12.6 million, net of a $4.9 million income tax benefit) of lease-related costs. The loss from discontinued operations for the second quarter and six months ended June 28, 2008 was $48.7 million ($78.8 million, net of a $30.1 million income tax benefit) of lease-related costs.

For internal comparisons, management finds it useful to assess year-to-year performance by adjusting diluted earnings per share for amortization, which primarily relates to acquisition activities.
The Company defines adjusted earnings per share as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus amortization, less income tax provision and dilutive earnings adjustment, divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.
Following is a reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision to adjusted earnings per share:
 
 
The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to properties and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions).
Following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 
 
The Company evaluates segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of discontinued operations and certain intersegment activities and charges.

Pharmacy Services Segment
The following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services Segment's performance for the respective periods:
 
 
The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA per adjusted claim as EBITDA divided by adjusted pharmacy claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims normalize the claims volume statistic for the difference in average days' supply for mail and retail claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims are calculated by multiplying 90-day claims (the majority of total mail claims) by 3 and adding the 30-day claims. EBITDA can be reconciled to operating profit, which we believe to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
