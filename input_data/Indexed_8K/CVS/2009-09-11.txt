(iv)           they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts), numerical data and other financial information contained in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages, numerical data and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Companys accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages, numerical data and other financial information to be in agreement with such results except as otherwise specified in such letter.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)         The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, members, directors and officers and affiliates and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, or the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; , , that the Company will not be liable under this Section 7(a) in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein (which information is specified in Section 12 hereof).  The foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter if (i) such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, (ii) the Company informed the Representatives of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was corrected in an amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus (or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) and such corrected Preliminary Prospectus (or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) was provided
provided
however
 
 
11
 
 
to the Underwriters such that the Underwriters had a reasonably sufficient amount of time prior to the Applicable Time to deliver such corrected Preliminary Prospectus (or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) to the persons to whom the Underwriters are selling the Notes, (iv) the timely delivery of such corrected Preliminary Prospectus (or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) to such person prior to the Applicable Time would have constituted a complete defense to the losses, claims, damages and liabilities asserted by such person and (v) such corrected Preliminary Prospectus (or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person prior to the Applicable Time.
 
(b)         Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and affiliates and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; , , that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, specifically for use therein (which information is specified in Section 12 hereof).
provided
however
 
(c)         Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)         If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to
 
 
12
 
 
be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company under this Agreement.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  The Underwriters obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(e)         The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
 
8.           .  If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Notes hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Notes, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments, hereunder, to purchase the Notes that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 7.  As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section.  Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Substitution of Underwriters
 
9.           .  Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (i) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any of the events described in Sections 6(d) of this Agreement, shall have occurred, or (iii) any other condition to the Underwriters obligations hereunder is not fulfilled.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(e) and 7 hereof.
Termination
 
Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 11 of this Agreement in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, will be immediately confirmed in writing.
 
10.           .  The agreements contained in Section 7 of this Agreement and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in Sections 1 and 4 of this Agreement will survive the delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters hereunder and will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
