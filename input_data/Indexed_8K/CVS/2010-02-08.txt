Fourth Quarter Year-Over-Year Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, February 8, 2010 - CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced record revenues, operating profit, and income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Revenues
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009, increased $1.7 billion to $25.8 billion, up from $24.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. For fiscal year 2009, total revenue increased 12.9% to a record $98.7 billion, compared to $87.5 billion in fiscal year 2008.
Revenues in the pharmacy services segment increased 14.5% to $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusting the growth rate for the impact of new generics, net revenues would have grown 18.3% in the pharmacy services segment. Pharmacy network claims processed during the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 5.6% to 151.4 million, compared to 160.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the termination of two large health plan clients effective January 1, 2009 and having three fewer reporting days in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This was partially offset by new client starts and the addition of RxAmerica claims for the full fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to a partial quarter in 2008. Mail choice claims processed during the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 4.4% to 16.7 million compared to 16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of net new client starts. For fiscal year 2009, total revenue in the pharmacy services segment increased 16.7% to $51.1 billion, compared to $43.8 billion in fiscal year 2008.
Revenues in the retail pharmacy segment increased 4.5% to $14.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Same store sales (sales from stores open more than one year) increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The growth rate of revenues in the retail pharmacy segment is lower than the growth rate of same
store sales due to three fewer reporting days in the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Pharmacy same store sales rose 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and were negatively impacted by approximately 290 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Pharmacy same store sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 were positively impacted by approximately 270 basis points due to Maintenance Choice. Front store same store sales increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For fiscal year 2009, total revenue in the retail pharmacy segment increased 13.0% to $55.4 billion, compared to $49.0 billion in fiscal year 2008.
The generic dispensing rate in our pharmacy services segment increased approximately 220 basis points to 68.9% and by approximately 260 basis points to 70.6% in our retail segment for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009, increased 10.2% to $1.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion during the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $108 million of intangible asset amortization related to acquisition activity, for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.79 (including the $0.01 per diluted share income tax benefit), compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2008. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.74 (including the $0.01 per diluted share income tax benefit), compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded approximately $167 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, of previously unrecognized tax benefits.
Income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, increased 10.9% to $3.7 billion, compared to $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2008. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, which excludes $430 million of intangible asset amortization related to acquisition activity, for 2009 were $2.74 (including the $0.12 per diluted share income tax benefit), compared to $2.44 in fiscal year 2008. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 were $2.56 (including the $0.12 per diluted share income tax benefit), compared with $2.27 in fiscal year 2008.
Tom Ryan, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We made good progress in 2009 in solidifying our position as the largest pharmacy health care provider in the nation with the broadest capabilities. We continued to make investments and forge strategic alliances that will enable us to capitalize on the evolving health care landscape and further differentiate our offerings in the marketplace. At the same time, we delivered financial performance ahead of our initial plan for the year, including the solid quarter we announced today. I'm very pleased to report continued industry-leading performance in our retail pharmacy business and solid performance in our PBM, which resulted in double-digit EPS growth and significant free cash flow generation."

For internal comparisons, management finds it useful to assess year-to-year performance by adjusting diluted income per share for amortization, which primarily relates to acquisition activities.
The Company defines adjusted earnings per share as income from continuing operations before income taxes plus amortization, less income tax provision and dilutive income adjustment, divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.
The following is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income tax provision to adjusted earnings per share:
 
 
The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to properties and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions).
The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 
 
The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of discontinued operations and certain intersegment activities and charges. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate segment based on operating expenses before the effect of discontinued operations and certain intersegment activities and charges. The following is a reconciliation of the Company's business segments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
 
 
Pharmacy Services Segment
The following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services segment's performance for the respective periods:
 
 
The Company defines EBITDA as income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA per adjusted claim as EBITDA divided by adjusted pharmacy claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims normalize the claims volume statistic for the difference in average days' supply for mail and retail claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims are calculated by multiplying 90-day claims (the majority of total mail claims) by 3 and adding the 30-day claims. EBITDA can be reconciled to operating profit, which we believe to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
The following is a reconciliation of operating profit to EBITDA:
