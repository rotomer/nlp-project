For purposes of this Section 1.02(iii), the nomination, election or removal of directors shall be deemed to be Similar Business with respect to all items of business involving the nomination, election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and filling of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors. The Board of Directors shall determine in good faith whether the requirements set forth in this Section 1.02(iii) have been satisfied.

A Requesting Stockholder may revoke a Special Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary and if, following such revocation, there are outstanding un-revoked requests from Requesting Stockholders holding less than the Requisite Percentage, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, cancel the special meeting. If none of the Requesting Stockholders appears or sends a duly authorized agent to present the business to be presented for consideration that was specified in the Special Meeting Request, the corporation need not present such business for a vote at such special meeting.
(v) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting pursuant to Section 1.03. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to the stockholders at any special meeting requested by stockholders.
(vi) Special meetings shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with these by-laws; , , that in the case of a special meeting requested by stockholders, the date of any such special meeting shall not be more than ninety (90) days after a Special Meeting Request that satisfies the requirements of this Section 1.02 is received by the Secretary.

If the notice is mailed, it shall be directed to a stockholder at the stockholder's address as it appears on the record of stockholders unless the stockholder shall
 
have filed with the Secretary of the corporation a written request that notices intended for the stockholder be mailed to some other address, in which case it shall be mailed to the address designated in such request.
Notice of a meeting need not be given to any stockholder who submits a signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting. The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by the stockholder.
Section 1.04 QUORUM. At any meeting of the stockholders the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and being present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless the representation of a different number shall be required by law or by another provision of these by-laws, and in that case the representation of the number so required shall constitute a quorum.
If the holders of the amount of shares necessary to constitute a quorum shall fail to attend in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting may adjourn from time to time without further notice other than by an announcement made at the meeting. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
Section 1.05 ORGANIZATION. The Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in his absence, the Chief Executive Officer or, in his absence, the President, any Executive Vice President, Senior Vice President or Vice President in the order of their seniority or in such other order as may be designated by the Board of Directors, shall call meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of such meetings.

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting on written consent, setting forth the action so taken, signed by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. Written consent thus given by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of the stockholders.
Section 1.08 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The Board of Directors, in advance of any stockholders' meeting, may appoint one or more Inspectors of Election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If Inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at a stockholders' meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder entitled to vote thereat, shall appoint one or more inspectors.

No business shall be conducted at a stockholder meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.02 and this Section 1.10. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these by-laws or that business was not properly brought before the meeting, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded or such business shall not be transacted, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or other proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded or such proposed business shall not be transacted, as the case may be, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.10, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such
 
stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.
(b) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.10, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.10; , , that any references in these by-laws to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 1.10, and compliance with paragraphs (i)(a)(C) and (ii) of this Section 1.10 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph (iii)(b)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the notice requirements set forth herein with respect to the proposal of any business pursuant to this Section 1.10 other than a nomination shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if such stockholder has submitted a proposal to the corporation in compliance with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time, and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for the meeting of stockholders.

For purposes of this Section 2.03, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes "for" a director's election must exceed fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes "against" a director's election will count as a vote cast, but "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" will not count as a vote cast with respect to that director's election.
Section 2.04 CONTESTED ELECTIONS. If, as of the last date by which stockholders may submit notice to nominate a person for election as a director pursuant to Section 1.10 of these by-laws, the number of nominees for any election of directors, exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast by holders of shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be elected.
Section 2.05 RESIGNATION AND REPLACEMENT OF UNSUCCESSFUL INCUMBENT DIRECTOR.

Directors of that resignation in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose.
(ii) The Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, shall no later than at its first regularly scheduled meeting following certification of the shareholder vote, determine whether to accept the resignation of the unsuccessful incumbent. Absent a determination by the Board of Directors that a compelling reason exists for concluding that it is in the best interests of the corporation for an unsuccessful incumbent to remain as a director, no such person shall be elected by the Board of Directors to serve as a director, and the Board of Directors shall accept that person's resignation.
(iii) The Board of Directors shall promptly consider and act upon the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in making this recommendation and the Board of Directors, in acting on such recommendation, may consider any factors or other information that they determine appropriate and relevant.

(v) The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors shall take the actions required under this Section 2.05 without the participation of any unsuccessful incumbent except that:
(a) If every member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is an unsuccessful incumbent, then a majority of the Board of Directors shall appoint a Board committee (the "Special Nominating Committee") of independent directors (as defined below) for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and making a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them; and
(b) If the number of independent directors who are not unsuccessful incumbents is three or fewer, all directors may participate in the decisions under this Section 2.05.
As used above, the term "independent director" shall mean a director who complies with the "independent director" requirements under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., under law or under any rule or regulation of any other regulatory body or self regulatory body applicable to the corporation.
(vi) If the Board of Directors accepts the resignation of a director who is an unsuccessful incumbent pursuant to this by-law, or if a nominee for director who is not an incumbent director does not receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast with respect to that director's election, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to Section 2.02, or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01.
Section 2.06 RESIGNATION. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors or to the Secretary of the corporation. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies (a) a later effective date or (b) an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events (including but not limited to a failure to receive more than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast in an election and the Board of Directors' acceptance of the resignation).
