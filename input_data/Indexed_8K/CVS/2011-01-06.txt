Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 30, 2010, CVS Caremark Corporation, a Delaware corporation (), Universal American Corp., a New York corporation (), and Ulysses Merger Sub, L.L.C., a New York limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Caremark (), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ).  The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Purchaser will merge with and into Universal American (the ), with Universal American surviving the Merger as a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Caremark.  Prior to the Merger, Universal American will transfer its non-Medicare Prescription Drug businesses, including its Medicare Advantage and Traditional Insurance businesses, to a newly-formed company (), as further described below, and Universal Americans shareholders will receive shares in NewCo as a portion of the consideration payable in the Merger (the ).  After giving effect to the Merger and the Split-Off, CVS Caremark will have acquired Universal Americans Medicare Prescription Drug Business, and Universal Americans non-Medicare Prescription Drug operations will be continued by NewCo as a separate company.

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Universal American, par value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) the cash consideration described below and (ii) one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of NewCo.  The Merger is subject to (i) the approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of Universal Americans outstanding common stock, (ii) the receipt of all regulatory approvals, including antitrust, and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions.
 
The aggregate amount of cash consideration payable to the shareholders of Universal American will be determined prior to the effective time of the Merger in accordance with a formula set forth in the Merger Agreement.  The initial aggregate cash consideration of $1.25 billion will be increased by an amount determined to be excess capital in Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, the principal entity that operates Universal Americans Medicare Prescription Drug business, as of December 31, 2010, and decreased by the amount of Universal Americans outstanding debt and trust preferred securities and certain other amounts.  The resulting aggregate cash consideration will be divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares of Universal Americans common stock to arrive at the per share cash consideration payable in the Merger.
 
In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Universal American, NewCo and CVS Caremark entered into a Separation Agreement dated as of December 30, 2010, pursuant to which Universal American will separate the Medicare Prescription Drug Business from its other businesses prior to the Split-Off.
 
Also in connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, CVS Caremark entered into Voting Agreements (collectively, the ) dated as of December 30, 2010 with Capital Z Partners III, L.P., Capital Z Financial Services Fund II, L.P., Capital Z Financial Services Private Fund II, L.P., Lee-Universal Holdings, LLC, Perry Corp., Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P., and Richard A. Barasch, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Universal American (the ).  Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, at any meeting of Universal Americans shareholders, or in connection with any written consent of Universal Americans shareholders, the Covered Shareholders must vote their shares of Universal American common stock (which represent, in the aggregate, approximately 55% of Universal Americans outstanding common stock as of December 30, 2010) in favor of the Merger and against any alternative proposals regarding the sale of Universal American.  However, if Universal Americans board of directors changes its recommendation to Universal Americans shareholders in favor of the Merger in connection with a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the aggregate number of shares held by the Covered Shareholders that are subject to the Voting Agreements will be reduced to 45% of Universal Americans outstanding common stock.  The Voting Agreements terminate upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the effective time of the Merger.

Covered Shareholders
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for each of CVS Caremark and Universal American, and if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Universal American is required to pay CVS Caremark a termination fee of $36 million and reimburse CVS Caremark for its out-of-pocket transaction-related expenses up to $5 million.
 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Universal American, CVS Caremark and Purchaser.  In addition to certain other covenants, Universal American has agreed not to
 
 
 
 
 
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any takeover proposal from a third party; (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information relating to Universal American to, any third party in connection with any takeover proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreement relating to a takeover proposal, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Voting Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are filed as Exhibits hereto and are incorporated into this report by reference.
 
The Merger Agreement governs the contractual rights between the parties in relation to the Merger.  The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about CVS Caremark or Universal American in CVS Caremarks or Universal Americans public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In particular, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to CVS Caremark or Universal American.  The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement have been negotiated with the principal purpose of establishi ng the circumstances in which a party may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts.  The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable under the securities laws.
