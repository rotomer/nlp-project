Exhibit 99.1
 
 
WOONSOCKET, R.I., August 9, 2011  CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE:CVS) announced today that it is soliciting consents (the Consent Solicitation) from the registered holders as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time on August 8, 2011 (the Record Date) of its 6.125% Senior Notes due August 15, 2016 (the Notes) to terminate the replacement capital covenant, which was entered into on May 25, 2007, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes in connection with the issuance of its 6.302% Enhanced Capital Advantaged Preferred Securities due 2062 (the ECAPS).  Under the replacement capital covenant, CVS Caremark is prohibited from repurchasing, redeeming or repaying its ECAPS on or before June 1, 2047 unless a specified portion of the funds used to repay, redeem or repurchase the ECAPS are obtained by CVS Caremark through the sale of common stock or certain other equity or equity-like securities. The termination of the replacement capital covenant requires the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (the Requisite Consents).
 
CVS Caremark will make a cash payment to each holder of the Notes of $15.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes as to which a duly executed consent is delivered and not revoked on or prior to the expiration of the Consent Solicitation if the consent solicitation is successful and the replacement capital covenant is terminated. Consents may be revoked at any time up to the earlier of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 22, 2011 and the time and date on which CVS Caremark receives the Requisite Consents.  Any consent payment due will be paid promptly after the expiration of the Consent Solicitation and termination of the replacement capital covenant. The Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 22, 2011, unless terminated or extended by CVS Caremark in its sole discretion. The Consent Solicitation is being made pursuant to a Consent Solicitation Statement dated today, which sets forth a more comprehensive description of the terms of the Consent Solicitation.  This press release is not a solicitation of consents to the proposed termination of the replacement capital covenant.
 
Copies of the Consent Solicitation Statement and the consent form may be obtained by holders of the Notes from the Information and Tabulation Agent for the Consent Solicitation, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at (800) 949-2583 (toll-free).
