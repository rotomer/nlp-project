WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, August 7, 2012 - CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced revenues, operating profit and net income for the three months ended June 30, 2012.
 
Revenues
 
Net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased 16.3%, or $4.3 billion, to $30.7 billion, up from $26.4 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2011.
 
Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 28.2% to $18.4 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by new client starts associated with our highly successful 2012 selling season, drug cost inflation, and new activity resulting from our acquisition of the Medicare prescription drug plan of Universal American Corp. ("UAM Medicare PDP Business") on April 29, 2011. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased 13.7%, to 197.8 million, compared to 174.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in pharmacy network claims was primarily due to new client starts and the Company's 2011 acquisition of the UAM Medicare PDP Business. Mail choice claims processed during
 
the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased approximately 15.5% to 20.5 million compared to 17.8 million in the prior year period. The increase in the mail choice claim volume was primarily driven by new client starts and the continued adoption of our unique Maintenance Choice
 program.
 
Revenues in the Retail Pharmacy Segment increased 6.9% to $15.8 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2012. Same store sales increased 5.6% over the prior year period, with pharmacy same store sales increasing 7.2% over the prior year period. The increase in pharmacy same store sales included a significant benefit associated with Walgreens not being part of the Express Scripts pharmacy provider network during the quarter.  Additionally, pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose 7.7% when 90-day scripts are counted as one script. When converting 90-day scripts into three scripts, our same store prescription volumes increased 9.8% in the quarter. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points due to recent generic introductions. Front store same store sales increased 2.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2012.
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2012, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 390 basis points to 78.0% in our Pharmacy Services Segment and 350 basis points to 79.1% in our Retail Pharmacy Segment, compared to the prior year period.
 
Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to CVS Caremark
 
Income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Caremark for the three months ended June 30, 2012 increased $153 million, to $967 million, compared with $814 million during the three months ended June 30, 2011. The increase in income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Caremark was primarily driven by an 18.5% increase in operating profit in our Retail Pharmacy Segment. Our retail business benefited significantly from the contractual impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts, the impact of increased generic drugs dispensed, and the continued growth of our Maintenance Choice program. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to CVS Caremark ("Adjusted EPS") for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were $0.81 and $0.65, respectively. Adjusted EPS excludes $123 million and $114 million of intangible asset amortization related to acquisition activity in the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to CVS Caremark for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were $0.75 and $0.60, respectively.
 
Larry Merlo, president and CEO, stated, "I'm very pleased with our strong operating performance this quarter, as we delivered results that were at or above our expectations in both the retail and PBM segments. Our retail business continued to benefit from the market disruption caused by the contractual impasse between two of our competitors, and we have detailed plans in place to maximize retention following their mid-September resolution. While the 2013 PBM selling season is still underway, we have achieved positive net-new business to-date and we are focused on the opportunities that remain. With our stable business and differentiated offerings, we remain very well positioned in the marketplace."
 
Real Estate Program
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2012, the Company opened 36 new retail drugstores and closed eight retail drugstores and one onsite pharmacy. In addition, the Company relocated 24 retail drugstores. As of June 30, 2012, the Company operated 7,457 locations, including 7,381 retail drugstores, 28 onsite pharmacies, 31 retail specialty pharmacy stores, 12 specialty mail order pharmacies and five mail order pharmacies in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
 
Guidance
 
The Company raised and narrowed its earnings guidance for the full year 2012, reflecting its strong performance year-to-date and a solid outlook for the remainder of the year. The new guidance includes the anticipated benefit in the third and fourth quarters combined of approximately $0.05 per share related to the prescription business expected to be retained from the contractual impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts. On July 19, 2012, Walgreens and Express Scripts announced that Walgreens will re-enter Express Scripts' broadest retail pharmacy network as of September 15, 2012. In the fourth quarter, the Company expects to retain at least 50% of the prescription business gained during the impasse. The Company currently expects to deliver Adjusted EPS of $3.32 to $3.38 for the full year 2012, up from its previous guidance of $3.23 to $3.33. The Company currently expects to deliver GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.09 to $3.15 for the full year 2012, up from its previous guidance of $3.01 to $3.11. The Company now expects the Retail Pharmacy Segment's operating profit to increase between 14% and 15%, and the Pharmacy Services Segment's operating profit to increase between 13% and 15%. The Company reiterated its 2012 free cash flow guidance and expects to generate between $4.6 billion and $4.9 billion for the year. Further, the Company confirmed that it expects to generate cash flow from operations in 2012 in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion. These 2012 guidance estimates assume the completion of the remaining $1.0 billion in previously authorized share repurchases.

For internal comparisons, management finds it useful to assess year-to-year performance by adjusting diluted earnings per share for amortization, which primarily relates to acquisition activities.
 
The Company defines adjusted earnings per share as income before income tax provision plus amortization, less adjusted income tax provision, plus net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.
 
The following is a reconciliation of income before income tax provision to adjusted earnings per share:
 
 
(1)
   
The adjusted income tax provision is computed using the effective income tax rate from the consolidated statement of income.
(2)
   
The adjusted results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 have been revised to reflect the results of TheraCom as discontinued operations.
The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to properties and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions).
 
The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:
 
The Company evaluates its Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segment performance based on net revenue, gross profit and operating profit before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The Company evaluates the performance of its Corporate Segment based on operating expenses before the effect of nonrecurring charges and gains and certain intersegment activities. The following is a reconciliation of the Company's segments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements:
 
 
(1)
         
Net revenues of the Pharmacy Services Segment include approximately $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion of retail co-payments for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as well as $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion of retail co-payments for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
(2)
         
Intersegment eliminations relate to two types of transactions: (i) Intersegment revenues that occur when Pharmacy Services Segment customers use Retail Pharmacy Segment stores to purchase covered products. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments record the revenue on a standalone basis, and (ii) Intersegment revenues, gross profit and operating profit that occur when Pharmacy Services Segment customers, through the Company's intersegment activities (such as the Maintenance Choice program), elect to pick-up their maintenance prescriptions at Retail Pharmacy Segment stores instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail Pharmacy segments record the revenue, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Maintenance Choice eliminations reflect all discounts available for the purchase of mail order prescription drugs. The following amounts are eliminated in consolidation in connection with the item (ii) intersegment activity: net revenues of $840 million and $626 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively; gross profit and operating profit of $97 million and $42 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and $172 million and $77 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The results of the Pharmacy Services Segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 have been revised to reflect the results of TheraCom as discontinued operations.
 
Pharmacy Services Segment
 
The following table summarizes the Pharmacy Services Segment's performance for the respective periods:
 
 
(1)
         
Pharmacy network net revenues, claims processed and generic dispensing rates do not include Maintenance Choice, which are included within the mail choice category.
(2)
         
Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services' mail facility, which includes specialty mail claims, as well as 90-day claims filled at retail under the Maintenance Choice program.
(3)
         
Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail pharmacies, including our retail drugstores.
(4)
         
The results of the Pharmacy Services Segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 have been revised to reflect the results of TheraCom as discontinued operations.
 
The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDA per adjusted claim as EBITDA divided by adjusted pharmacy claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims normalize the claims volume statistic for the difference in average days' supply for mail and retail claims. Adjusted pharmacy claims are calculated by multiplying 90-day claims (the majority of total mail claims) by 3 and adding the 30-day claims. EBITDA can be reconciled to operating profit, which we believe to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
The following is a reconciliation of operating profit to EBITDA for the Pharmacy Services Segment:
