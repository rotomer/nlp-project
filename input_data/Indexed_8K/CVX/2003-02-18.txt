CHEVRONTEXACO CAPITAL COMPANY 3.375% GUARANTEED NOTE DUE 2008 This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, not limited in aggregate principal amount, all issued or to be issued in one or more series of varying dates, numbers, interest rates and other provisions, under an Indenture dated as of July 15, 2002, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 10, 2002 and the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 12, 2003 (such indenture as so amended being herein referred to as the "Indenture") each being among the Company, ChevronTexaco Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ChevronTexaco"), as guarantor, and the Trustee. This Note is one of a series of Notes designated as its "3.375% Guaranteed Notes Due 2008" aggregating $750,000,000 in principal amount (herein called the "Notes"). Reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a description of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, ChevronTexaco, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, to all of the provisions of which Indenture the registered owner of this Note, by acceptance hereof, assents and agrees. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which term is defined in the Indenture as any security or securities of the Company, authenticated and delivered under the Indenture) at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) and affected by such supplemental indenture, to execute one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security (including the Notes) affected thereby: (1) change the fixed maturity or redemption date of any Note, or reduce the rate of interest on any Note or the method of determining such rate of interest or extend the time of payment of interest, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which the Notes or the interest thereon is payable or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, (2) reduce the aforesaid percentage of holders of the Outstanding Securities whose consent is required for the execution of such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the holders of which is required for any waiver provided for in the Indenture or (3) change the time of payment. It is also provided in the Indenture that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may waive (a) compliance by ChevronTexaco with the covenants contained in Article Four of the Indenture with respect to the Notes and (b) any past or existing Event of Default with respect to the Notes and its consequences except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Notes or in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the registered owner of the Note so affected. Under the terms of the Indenture, ChevronTexaco unconditionally guarantees to the holders from time to time of the Notes: (a) the full and prompt payment of the principal of the Notes when and as the same shall become due and (b) the full and prompt payment of the interest on the Notes when the same shall become due. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the currency herein prescribed, nor shall any such reference alter or impair the obligation of ChevronTexaco to unconditionally guarantee to the holders from time to time of the Notes the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes. The Notes shall be subject to redemption at the option of the Company as a whole or in part, on any date at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including the portion of any such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as hereinafter defined), plus interest accrued on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. The redemption price is calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The "Adjusted Treasury Rate" is to be determined on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date and means (1) the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the Statistical Release (hereinafter defined) most recently published prior to the date of determination under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month) corresponding to the remaining term, as of the redemption date, of the Notes being redeemed plus (2) 0.10%. If no maturity set forth under such heading exactly corresponds to the term of the Notes being redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the remaining term of the Notes being redeemed will be calculated as described in the preceding sentence, and the Adjusted Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding each of the relevant period to the nearest month. The term "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designation "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively-traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any determination under the terms of the Notes, then such other reasonably comparable index as the Company shall designate. As provided in the Indenture, notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owners of Notes to be redeemed by mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to their addresses as they appear on the register books. If an Event of Default (as that term is defined in the Indenture) shall occur, the principal of all Notes and the interest accrued thereon may be declared due and payable upon the conditions, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding. The Notes are issuable in registered form in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate amount of Notes of other authorized denominations as provided in the Indenture. This Note is transferable at the office of the Trustee in New York, New York by the registered owner hereof in person, or by such registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, on the books of the Company at said office, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges provided in the Indenture, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Note. Upon such transfer a new fully registered Note or Notes of authorized denomination or denominations, for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor. The Company, ChevronTexaco, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, ChevronTexaco or the Trustee and any paying agent may treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone other than the Company, ChevronTexaco or the Trustee) for the purpose of receiving payment hereof or on account hereof and for all other purposes, and none of the Company, ChevronTexaco, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. THIS NOTE AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND CHEVRONTEXACO IN RESPECT HEREOF ARE GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or ChevronTexaco or of any successor of the Company or ChevronTexaco, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
