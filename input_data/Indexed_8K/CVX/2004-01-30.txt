EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR RELEASE AT 5:30 AM PST JANUARY 30, 2004
      ChevronTexaco Corp. today reported preliminary net income of $1.7 billion ($1.63 per share  diluted) for the fourth quarter 2003, compared with net income of $0.9 billion ($0.85 per share  diluted) in the year-ago period.
SAN RAMON, Calif., Jan. 30, 2004
     The 2003 fourth quarter included a net gain of $89 million from special items, compared with net special-item charges of $161 million in the corresponding 2002 period. Foreign currency losses of $171 million in the 2003 quarter were $92 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2002.
     For the full year, net income was $7.2 billion ($6.96 per share  diluted), versus $1.1 billion ($1.07 per share  diluted) in 2002. Included in net income for 2003 were net charges of $196 million for the cumulative effect of accounting principle changes, primarily relating to a new accounting standard for
 
recognizing asset retirement obligations. Net charges for special items were $53 million and $3.3 billion for 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     "Our fourth quarter performance capped an excellent year for the company," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "On the strength of our upstream operations and much-improved results from our downstream businesses, we achieved near-record profits in 2003.
     "The sustained profit levels, along with strong cash flows and our positive outlook for the future, enabled us to raise the common stock dividend in the third quarter  maintaining an unbroken 16-year record of annual dividend payment increases," O'Reilly added.
     O'Reilly noted the company's debt ratio of 26 percent at the end of 2003 had declined from 34 percent at the beginning of the year. Total debt in the period had been reduced $3.7 billion, and the company also funded $1.3 billion to employee pension plans in the second half of the year. Cash balances increased $1.3 billion during 2003 to $4.3 billion. Return on average capital employed for the year was 16 percent.
     "While turning in an excellent year from the standpoint of earnings and cash flows, we also made significant progress furthering our longer-term strategic objectives," O'Reilly added. "Among the initiatives undertaken during the year was the formation of two new business units. One is focused on commercializing our vast international natural gas resource base. The other is dedicated solely to the identification and development of large-scale investment opportunities throughout the world."
     O'Reilly also remarked on other strategic milestones and operational successes achieved during 2003 and early 2004:
     
Upstream
 Grow profitability in core areas and build new legacy positions:
 
     
Global Gas
 Commercialize the equity resource base by targeting North America and Asia markets:
     
Downstream
 Improve returns and focus on areas of market and supply strength:
     In summary, O'Reilly said, "Our 2003 performance enhanced our already strong financial position. These results help to keep us on course towards our goal of being No. 1 in total stockholder return among our peer competitors."
     The company noted that ChevronTexaco common stock rose 30 percent in value during 2003 and outpaced the broader market indexes in the same period.
     The company also provided additional detail about factors contributing to the overall quarterly profit improvement from the year-ago period. In the upstream business, the average U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids sales price in the quarter rose about $2.60 per barrel to more than $26. Internationally, the average
 
liquids price increased $1.70 per barrel to about $27. The average U.S. natural gas sales price increased more than 20 percent to about $4.35 per thousand cubic feet. Internationally, the average price of natural gas rose 15 percent from the year-ago quarter to about $2.70. Partially offsetting the benefit from higher oil and gas prices in the quarter was an approximate 3 percent decrease in worldwide oil-equivalent production from the year-ago period.
     For the downstream business, the primary driver for the improved results in the 2003 quarter was higher margins for refined products worldwide. Margins in the 2002 quarter were extremely weak, contributing to an overall loss for both the U.S. and international segments. Gains under the last in, first out (LIFO) inventory method were also higher in 2003 than in the prior year.
     Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter were $30 billion, up about 12 percent from the 2002 period. For the full year 2003, sales and other operating revenues were $120 billion, up 22 percent compared with the prior year. These increases were mainly the result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
     Foreign currency losses included in fourth quarter 2003 net income were $171 million, compared with $79 million in the year-ago period. The results for 2003 included foreign currency losses of $404 million, compared with $43 million in 2002. The adverse currency effects in 2003 were the result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of several countries, including those of Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.
     Net special items of $89 million in the fourth quarter 2003 included a gain of $118 million related to a favorable income tax adjustment, as well as a net gain of $71 million from asset dispositions. Partially offsetting these amounts were special charges of $60 million for employee severance costs connected with restructurings and reorganizations, and $40 million for the company's share of an asset impairment by its Dynegy Inc. affiliate.
     
U.S. Exploration and Production
     U.S. exploration and production income of $721 million in the fourth quarter increased $214 million from the 2002 period. This improvement primarily resulted from higher crude oil and natural gas prices, which was offset partially by lower crude oil and natural gas production.
     Net special charges of $15 million in the 2003 quarter included $38 million of charges for employee severance costs, which were partially offset by gains from property sales.
 
     Net oil-equivalent production declined 3 percent, or 29,000 barrels per day, from the 2002 quarter. This resulted primarily from normal field declines, the effects of which were only partially offset by first-time production in certain fields and higher production in areas of the Gulf of Mexico that were affected by storm damage in late 2002. The net liquids component of production was down 2 percent to 547,000 barrels per day. Net natural gas production averaged 2.1 billion cubic feet per day, down 4 percent.
     
International Exploration and Production
     International exploration and production income increased $103 million from the year-ago quarter to $848 million, due mainly to higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and lower exploration expenses. The net effect of special-item gains and foreign currency losses in both periods was essentially the same.
     Special items in the fourth quarter 2003 included benefits of $143 million related to income taxes and property sales.
     Net foreign currency losses of $132 million in the 2003 quarter mainly related to weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.
     Net oil-equivalent production declined 2 percent, or 38,000 barrels per day, from the year-ago fourth quarter. The net liquids component declined 29,000 barrels per day to 1,256,000. The largest reduction occurred in Nigeria, where certain onshore production has been shut in since March 2003 as a result of civil unrest.
U.S. Refining, Marketing and Transportation
     U.S. refining, marketing and transportation earnings of $77 million improved $212 million from the loss incurred in the 2002 quarter. The primary reason for the improvement was a recovery in the West Coast refined-product margins, resulting mainly from lower industry inventory levels in 2003. The 2003 quarter also included a $44 million LIFO-inventory gain; the LIFO effect in the 2002 quarter was negligible.
     The quarter's average refined product sales price increased 6 percent to about $39 per barrel. Sales volumes for refined products decreased 3 percent to 1,502,000 barrels per day. The reduction reflected weaker West Coast demand for gasoline, a decline in diesel fuel sales in the El Paso, Texas, distributive area
 
following the sale of the company's refinery in August 2003, and a decrease in branded and supply sales of jet fuel. Branded gasoline sales volumes declined 4 percent from the year-ago quarter to 553,000 barrels per day.
     Special-item gains of $23 million in the 2003 quarter resulted from the sale of service stations in various markets.
International Refining, Marketing and Transportation
     International refining, marketing and transportation earned $156 million in the 2003 quarter, vs. a $31 million loss in the year-ago period. The improvement resulted mainly from higher refined-product margins in most of the company's operating areas. Shipping profits also improved between periods on higher freight rates. LIFO-inventory gains were $33 million and $13 million in the 2003 and 2002 quarters, respectively.
     Total refined-product sales volumes of 2,271,000 barrels per day decreased 2 percent from the 2002 fourth quarter.
     Chemical operations earned $3 million, vs. $13 million in the 2002 quarter. A decline in results for the Oronite subsidiary more than offset an improvement in profits for the company's 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC affiliate.
     All Other consists of the company's interest in Dynegy, coal mining operations, power and gasification businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.
 
     Net segment charges were $70 million in the fourth quarter 2003, compared with net charges of $195 million in the corresponding 2002 period. The $40 million special-item charge in the 2003 quarter related to the company's share of an asset write-off by its Dynegy affiliate.
     Excluding effects of special items, net segment charges increased by $8 million between quarters. The combination of higher employee-related costs and lower foreign exchange gains exceeded the benefits of lower interest expenses and favorable tax adjustments.
     Capital and exploratory expenditures, including the company's share of affiliates' expenditures, were $7.4 billion in 2003, compared with $9.3 billion in 2002. About 55 percent of the 2003 expenditures were for international exploration and production projects. Included in the 2002 amount was $1.2 billion associated with the acquisition of assets previously leased, higher investments in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project and additional investments in equity affiliates. Also in 2002, the company's share of spending by equity affiliates was about $200 million higher than in 2003.
