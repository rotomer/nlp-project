News Release
FOR RELEASE AT 5:30 AM PST
EXHIBIT 99.1
JANUARY 27, 2006                         
      Chevron Corp. today reported quarterly net income of $4.1 billion ($1.86 per share  diluted) in the fourth quarter 2005, compared with $3.4 billion ($1.63 per share  diluted) in the year-ago period. Earnings in the 2004 period included a special-item gain of $146 million ($0.06 per share) related to asset sales.
SAN RAMON, Calif., January 27, 2006
     For the full year 2005, net income was $14.1 billion ($6.54 per share  diluted). Earnings in 2004 were $13.3 billion ($6.28 per share  diluted), which included net special-item gains of $1.2 billion ($0.54 per share) relating primarily to the disposition of nonstrategic upstream properties.
     Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter were $53 billion, up from $42 billion a year earlier. For the full year 2005, revenues were $194 billion, compared with $151 billion in 2004. The increase in both comparative periods was due mainly to higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as the inclusion of revenues related to former-Unocal operations for the last five months of 2005.
 
Quarterly Results
     "Our strong performance in the fourth quarter capped a second consecutive year of record earnings for our company," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "We achieved these results despite an estimated $1.4 billion negative impact on profits in the second half of the year, the consequence of disruptions caused by third-quarter hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. About half of this adverse effect on earnings related to the fourth quarter." O'Reilly said the hurricane effects included a reduction in crude oil and natural gas production, costs for repairs and maintenance of both offshore and onshore facilities, asset write-offs and expenses for other uninsured storm-related items.
     "Despite several employee evacuations from the Gulf of Mexico last year due to the storms, as well as the massive effort that followed to restore operations, our company turned in its safest work year ever in 2005," O'Reilly added. "And building on that achievement, our employees along the Gulf Coast have continued their repair and maintenance activities at a steady and safe pace."
     O'Reilly said that prior to the storms that began last August, the company's production in the Gulf of Mexico was approximately 300,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Daily production in the fourth quarter averaged about 160,000. During the full year 2006, production is expected to average approximately 200,000 barrels per day, with a slightly higher rate occurring in the first half of the year.
     In other comments on the quarterly results, O'Reilly said earnings of $3.3 billion for the company's upstream operations in the 2005 period improved 46 percent from a year earlier, mainly attributable to higher prices for crude oil and natural gas. Also contributing to the higher earnings were worldwide oil-equivalent production volumes that were up 11 percent from the fourth quarter 2004. Downstream earnings of $808 million were off 25 percent from the fourth quarter 2004, primarily the result of lower margins for refined products in the company's European and Asia-Pacific areas of operation, carryover effects of the U.S. hurricanes and costs associated with a fire at a 40 percent-owned, nonoperated products terminal in the United Kingdom.
Selected Financial Measures
     The company's return on capital employed for the full year 2005 was 22 percent. Common stock acquired in the open market during the year totaled $3 billion, including approximately $750 million in the fourth quarter. Dividend payouts on common stock increased for the eighteenth consecutive year in 2005. At the end of the year, balances of cash and marketable securities totaled $11.1 billion, up about $400 million from the end of 2004. Total debt at December 31, 2005, stood at $12.9 billion, up $1.6 billion from a year earlier, due to the debt assumed in the Unocal acquisition. The company's debt ratio at the end of 2005 was 17 percent, down from 20 percent at year-end 2004.
Operating Developments and Strategic Progress
     In remarks on operational activities in recent months, O'Reilly said, "We continue to see major progress in achieving our upstream and global natural gas objectives to grow profitability in our core areas of operation, build new legacy positions and commercialize our significant natural gas resource base." O'Reilly
 
noted a number of strategic milestones and operational successes in recent months for these and other activities:
Upstream
Global Natural Gas Projects
Preliminary Report of Proved Reserves  Crude Oil and Natural Gas
 
Downstream
Chemicals
Near-Term Outlook
     O'Reilly said the company's average worldwide oil-equivalent production level of 2.5 million barrels per day in 2005 is expected to increase to an average of 2.7 to 2.8 million in 2006. The additional volumes are attributable mainly to the properties acquired from Unocal and new project start-ups that are expected to help offset normal field declines in existing operations. The actual production level in 2006 will depend on several factors, including the rate of recovery of production currently being restored in the Gulf of Mexico and production that may have to be shut in during the year due to weather conditions, civil unrest or other disruption to daily operations.
     "We enter 2006 a stronger company," O'Reilly said. "The acquisition of Unocal last summer was an excellent fit with our already-strong asset portfolio. Our employees have worked diligently to integrate the operations of the two companies. And we are on track to realize the projected cost savings in the many geographic areas where Chevron and Unocal had overlapping interests.
     "As we build upon our performance in 2005," O'Reilly said, "I am optimistic about our continued ability to provide new energy supplies for the world economies and add value for our company's stockholders."
     Worldwide oil-equivalent production in the fourth quarter 2005, including volumes produced from oil sands in Canada and production under an operating service agreement in Venezuela, increased 11 percent, or 270,000 barrels per day, from the fourth quarter 2004 to 2,683,000 barrels per day. The increase between periods was the result of production associated with the acquisition of Unocal in August 2005. Approximately 140,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in during the 2005 fourth
 
quarter as a result of the carryover effects of the third-quarter hurricanes. In the fourth quarter 2004, approximately 60,000 barrels per day were offline due to hurricane damages.
     Average U.S. prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the fourth quarter 2005 increased $14 to $52 per barrel from the year-ago period. Internationally, prices were up nearly $13 per barrel to more than $50. The average U.S. natural gas sales price increased 69 percent to more than $10 per thousand cubic feet, while internationally the average natural gas price of $3.50 per thousand cubic feet was 21 percent higher than a year earlier.
     
U.S. Exploration and Production
     U.S. exploration and production income of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter increased 28 percent from the 2004 period. The 2004 results included special-item gains of $87 million relating to property sales. The increase in earnings between periods was attributable mainly to higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and results from the former Unocal operations. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher operating expenses for the heritage-Chevron properties, including costs associated with the restoration of facilities that were damaged by the hurricanes.
     Net oil-equivalent production of 717,000 barrels per day declined 7,000 barrels per day, or 1 percent, from the 2004 quarter. Production additions in 2005 from the properties acquired from Unocal were more than offset by the effects of hurricanes and normal field declines.
     
International Exploration and Production
     International exploration and production income of $2.0 billion increased from $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2004, primarily the result of higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and earnings from the former Unocal operations.
     Net oil-equivalent production, including volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement, increased 277,000 barrels per day, or 16 percent, from the year-ago period to 1,966,000. Absent the Unocal volumes in the quarter and lower volumes associated with the effect of higher
 
prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain production-sharing contracts, net oil-equivalent production was essentially flat between periods.
     
U.S. Refining, Marketing and Transportation
     U.S. refining, marketing and transportation earnings of $385 million were little-changed from the 2004 quarter. Average margins for refined products were up from the year-ago period, but the benefits were largely offset by refinery downtime and the effects of the hurricanes.
     Despite higher refinery input in the fourth quarter 2005, the downtime during the period resulted in lower production of higher-valued refined products than in the 2004 quarter and dampened earnings.
     Sales volumes for refined products decreased 1 percent to 1,443,000 barrels per day in the 2005 quarter, as certain sales were affected by supply constraints following the hurricanes.
     
International Refining, Marketing and Transportation
     International refining, marketing and transportation operations earned $423 million in the 2005 quarter, a decrease of $281 million from the fourth quarter 2004. The decrease resulted mainly from lower margins associated with operations in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, costs related to an explosion and fire at a 40 percent-owned terminal in England and tax adjustments in various countries. Refinery input systemwide was essentially unchanged from the 2004 fourth quarter.
     Total refined-product sales volumes of 2,318,000 barrels per day were 3 percent lower than in last year's quarter. The decline was primarily the result of lower gasoline trading activity and reduced sales of gas oil and fuel oil.
     Chemical operations earned $71 million, down 5 percent from the 2004 quarter. Results for the company's Oronite subsidiary were flat between periods. Earnings associated with the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC declined due to income tax adjustments that more than offset the benefit of improved margins for commodity chemicals.
 
     All Other consists of the company's interest in Dynegy, coal mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
     Income net of charges in the fourth quarter 2005 was $15 million, compared with income of $62 million in the corresponding 2004 period. Foreign exchange effects reduced earnings in the 2005 period by $21 million but increased earnings in the 2004 quarter by $26 million.
     Both quarters also included significant benefits to income of approximately the same amount. The 2005 period included the company's share of a gain on the sale of midstream assets by its Dynegy affiliate, which was partially offset by a loss related to Dynegy's settlement of a tolling arrangement. The items in the fourth quarter 2004 included corporate consolidated tax effects.
     Excluding the cost of the Unocal acquisition, capital and exploratory expenditures in 2005, including the company's share of expenditures by affiliates, were $11.1 billion, compared with $8.3 billion in the 2004 annual period. Expenditures in the last five months of 2005 that related to the former Unocal properties were approximately $800 million. Upstream expenditures in 2005 were $8.4 billion, of which $700 million was associated with the Unocal properties. The company's share of equity affiliates' expenditures was about $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
