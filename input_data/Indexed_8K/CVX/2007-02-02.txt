EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR RELEASE AT 5:30 AM PST
FEBRUARY 2, 2007
      Chevron Corporation today reported preliminary net income of $3.77 billion ($1.74 per share  diluted) for the fourth quarter 2006, compared with $4.14 billion ($1.86 per share  diluted) in the 2005 fourth quarter. For the full year 2006, net income was $17.14 billion ($7.80 per share  diluted), an increase of 22 percent from $14.10 billion ($6.54 per share  diluted) in 2005.
SAN RAMON, Calif., February 2, 2007
     "Fourth quarter earnings benefited from an improvement in the operating performance of our oil and gas fields and refineries, especially in the United States," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "However, this benefit to earnings was more than offset by the effect of a sharp decline in U.S. natural gas prices from a year earlier."
Operating Developments and Strategic Progress
     The company also noted other activities of operational and strategic importance in recent months:
 
Success in 2006
     "We achieved success on many fronts in 2006," O'Reilly said. "Earnings for the year were a record for our company, and we operated safely and reliably. Our refineries achieved their highest utilization rate in several years. We also completed the integration of the former Unocal operations and reached a number of milestones during the year on our major capital projects.
     "As we begin 2007, our queue of excellent projects, strong financial position and dedicated workforce provide a solid foundation for our company's future growth," O'Reilly added.
     Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.66 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2006, about the same as the corresponding 2005 period. Production for the full year 2006 averaged 2.67 million barrels per day, up from 2.52 million in 2005. The increase between years was mainly attributable to 2005 having included only five months of production associated with Unocal properties that were acquired in August of that year.
     The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in the United States was $51 in the fourth quarter 2006, down about $1 from the corresponding period in 2005. Outside the United States, the sales price increased more than $1 to $52 per barrel. The average U.S. natural gas sales price
 
decreased 42 percent to $5.90 per thousand cubic feet in the fourth quarter 2006, while outside the United States the average price of $3.67 per thousand cubic feet was 5 percent higher than a year earlier.
     
U.S. Upstream
     U.S. upstream income of $886 million in the fourth quarter decreased 28 percent from the corresponding period in 2005. The primary reason for the decline was a sharp drop in the average price of natural gas. Other factors included higher operating expenses and an increase in depreciation expense for wells, equipment and facilities. Partially offsetting these adverse effects on earnings was the benefit of an increase in production of crude oil and natural gas.
     Net oil-equivalent production of 763,000 barrels per day increased approximately 6 percent from the 2005 quarter, due mainly to restoration of volumes following the effects of hurricanes in 2005. The net liquids component of production was up 5 percent to 466,000 barrels per day. Net natural gas production was 9 percent higher at approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day.
     
International Upstream
     International upstream earnings of approximately $2 billion were relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter 2005. While oil-equivalent production was lower in the 2006 fourth quarter, sales volumes were higher due to the timing of cargo liftings in certain producing regions. The benefit to earnings from this increase in liftings, as well as higher prices for crude oil and natural gas, was offset by increases in exploration, depreciation and operating expense. Foreign currency effects reduced earnings $52 million in the 2006 fourth quarter but increased earnings by $5 million a year earlier.
     Net oil-equivalent production decreased 74,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter 2005 to 1,892,000 barrels per day. In Venezuela, the conversion of operating service agreements to joint venture arrangements resulted in a decline of about 90,000 barrels per day between the quarterly periods. Elsewhere, production was higher in Nigeria, Angola and Azerbaijan but lower in Indonesia and the United Kingdom. The net liquids component of production decreased 37,000 barrels per day to 1,381,000. Natural gas production was 3.1 billion cubic feet per day in the 2006 period, down about 200 million cubic feet per day from a year earlier.
     
U.S. Downstream
 
     U.S. downstream earnings of $343 million decreased by 11 percent from the 2005 quarter, mainly the result of lower average margins for refined products and higher operating expenses. Sales volumes were higher between periods, and refinery crude input was up 20,000 barrels per day to 916,000.
     Reported sales volumes for refined products increased 2 percent in the fourth quarter 2006 to 1,471,000 barrels per day. Effective in April 2006, a new accounting standard required certain purchase and sale contracts with the same counterparty to be netted for reporting. These types of transactions previously were reported separately as a purchase and a sale. Excluding the impact of this new accounting standard, refined-product sales volumes were up 8 percent from the 2005 fourth quarter, reflecting increased sales of gas oil and branded gasoline.
     
International Downstream
     International downstream earnings of $611 million in the 2006 quarter increased $188 million from the year-ago period. The increase was largely attributable to foreign exchange effects and charges in the 2005 period related to the uninsured portion of a loss due to property damage. Refined-product margins and sales volumes were lower between periods.
     Refinery crude input was down 53,000 barrels per day from the 2005 fourth quarter due to planned downtime at the company's refinery in the United Kingdom. Refined-product sales volumes of 2,093,000 barrels per day were 8 percent lower. Excluding the effects of the new accounting standard for purchase and sale contracts, sales volumes were down 3 percent.
     Chemical operations earned $124 million, compared with $71 million in the 2005 fourth quarter. Most of the increase was the result of improved margins on sales of lubricant and fuel additives by the company's Oronite subsidiary. Earnings also were higher for the company's 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.
     All Other consists of the company's interest in Dynegy, mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
 
     Charges in the fourth quarter 2006 were $215 million, compared with income of $15 million in the year-ago period, which included the company's share of a gain on the sale of assets by Dynegy.
     Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter were $46 billion, down from $53 billion a year earlier. Most of the decline was associated with the impact of the accounting-rule change that requires certain purchase and sale contracts with the same counterparty to be netted for reporting. For the full year 2006, sales and other operating revenues were $205 billion, compared with $194 billion in 2005.
     Capital and exploratory expenditures for the full year 2006, including the company's share of expenditures by affiliates, were $16.6 billion, compared with $11.1 billion in 2005. A portion of the increase was associated with expenditures for Unocal properties acquired in August 2005. The company's share of affiliates' expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company, was about $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Upstream expenditures in 2006 were $12.8 billion, or 77 percent of the total.
