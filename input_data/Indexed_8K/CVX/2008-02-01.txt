Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation ("Chevron") approved an amendment to Article IV, Section 1 of Chevron's By-Laws to permit Chevron stockholders to cause a special meeting of stockholders to be held. The amendment, which was effective immediately upon approval, permits holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding shares of Chevron common stock entitled to vote to submit a written request to the Chairman of the Board or Secretary to cause the special meeting to be held. The amendment also provides that the Chairman of the Board or Secretary shall not call a special meeting of stockholders if (i) the Board has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders and the purpose of such annual meeting includes the purpose specified in the request or (ii) an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request to call the special meeting was received, which included the purpose specified in the request. Previously, Chevron stockholders were not empowered to cause a special meeting of stockholders to be held.
The amended By-Laws of Chevron reflecting this amendment are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report.

     Written requests by stockholders must be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent, requesting the special meeting and state (i) the specific purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest in such business of the stockholders requesting the meeting; (ii) the name and address of each such stockholder; (iii) the number of shares of the Corporation's Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by each such stockholder. Stockholders may revoke their requests for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary.

However, a special meeting shall not be held if either (i) the Board has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders and the purpose of such annual meeting includes the purpose specified in the request, or (ii) an annual or special meeting was held not more than 12 months before the request to call the special meeting was received which included the purpose specified in the request.

     The Chairman of the Board, or such other officer as may preside at any meeting of the stockholders, shall have authority to establish, from time to time, such rules for the conduct of such meeting, and to take such action, as may in his judgment be necessary or proper for the conduct of the meeting and in the best interests of the Corporation and the stockholders in attendance in person or by proxy.

Any Director nominated for reelection who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" such election shall submit his or her offer of resignation to the Board. The Board Nominating and Governance Committee shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the Director's qualifications, the Director's past and expected future contributions to the Corporation, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the Corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation (including NYSE listing requirements and federal securities laws) and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offer of resignation. Except as may otherwise be required by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, all other matters shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.
SECTION 3.
Quorum for Action by Stockholders; Elections
.
     To the extent permitted by law, any stockholder of record may appoint a person or persons to act as the stockholder's proxy or proxies at any stockholder meeting for the purpose of representing and voting the stockholder's shares. The stockholder may make this appointment by any means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware specifically authorizes, and by any other means the Secretary of the Corporation may permit. Prior to any vote, and subject to any contract rights of the proxy holder, the stockholder may revoke the proxy appointment either directly or by the creation of a new appointment, which will automatically revoke the former one. The Inspector of Elections appointed for the meeting may establish requirements concerning such proxy appointments or revocations that the Inspector considers necessary or appropriate to assure the integrity of the vote and to comply with law.

Proxies

     Any meeting of the stockholders (whether annual or special and whether or not a quorum shall have been present), may be adjourned from time to time and from place to place by vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented at such meeting, without notice other than announcement at such meeting of the time and place at which the meeting is to be resumedsuch adjournment and the reasons therefor being recorded in the journal of proceedings of the meeting; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the
