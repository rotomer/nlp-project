EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR RELEASE AT 5:30 AM PST
JANUARY 30, 2009                        
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported net income of $4.90 billion ($2.44 per share  diluted) for the fourth quarter 2008, up from $4.88 billion ($2.32 per share  diluted) in the year-ago period.
SAN RAMON, Calif., January 30, 2009
     Results for the 2008 fourth quarter included a gain of approximately $600 million on an upstream asset-exchange transaction. Foreign-currency effects benefited net income by $478 million in the period, compared with a reduction to earnings of $2 million in the 2007 fourth quarter.
     Full-year 2008 net income was $23.93 billion ($11.67 per share  diluted), up 28 percent from $18.69 billion ($8.77 per share  diluted) in 2007.
     Sales and other operating revenues in the fourth quarter 2008 were $43 billion, compared with $60 billion a year earlier. For the year 2008, sales and other operating revenues were $265 billion, versus $214 billion in 2007.
     "Fourth-quarter earnings for our downstream business improved as the lower cost of crude-oil feedstocks used in the refining process helped boost margins on the sale of gasoline and other refined products," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "Lower quarterly profits for our upstream operations reflected a sharp decline in crude-oil prices from a year ago.
     "We achieved much success in 2008," O'Reilly added. "Record earnings and strong cash flows for the year enabled us to invest $23 billion in an attractive portfolio of capital and exploratory projects, buy back $8 billion of our common stock and increase the dividend payment on our common shares for the 21st consecutive year. We enter 2009 with the financial strength to meet the challenges of a difficult economy and with a continued focus on cost management and capital stewardship."
 
     O'Reilly also noted other activities of operational and strategic importance in recent months:
     Worldwide oil-equivalent production averaged 2.54 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with 2.61 million barrels per day in the corresponding 2007 period. The decline between periods was primarily associated with the ongoing effect of damage to production facilities caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2008.
     
U.S. Upstream
     U.S. upstream income of $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 decreased $229 million from a year earlier. The 2008 period included an approximate $600 million gain on a transaction involving the receipt of Chevron stock in exchange for a producing property, plus cash. Prices for crude oil and natural gas were lower in the 2008 fourth quarter. Oil-equivalent production was also lower, and operating expenses were higher.
     The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $49 in the fourth quarter 2008, down from $79 in the corresponding 2007 period. The average sales price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas decreased from $6.08 to $5.23.
 
     Net oil-equivalent production was 619,000 barrels per day in the 2008 fourth quarter, down 111,000 from a year earlier. About 75 percent of the decline was associated with the continuing effects of production that was shut-in as a result of September hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component of production was down 12 percent at 399,000 barrels per day, and net natural gas production declined 21 percent to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day.
     At the end of 2008, approximately 50,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent production remained offline in the Gulf of Mexico due to the hurricanes, with restoration of the volumes to occur as repairs to third-party pipelines and producing facilities are completed.
     
International Upstream
     International upstream earnings of $2 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 decreased $1.46 billion from a year earlier due to lower prices for crude oil, a reduction in sales volumes associated with the timing of certain cargo liftings and higher depreciation expense. Foreign-currency effects benefited earnings by $644 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with an $88 million reduction to income in the 2007 corresponding period.
     The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $47 in the 2008 quarter, down from $80 a year earlier. The average sales price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas increased from $4.32 to $5.10.
     Net oil-equivalent production was 1.92 million barrels per day in the 2008 fourth quarter, up 38,000 barrels per day from a year earlier. The 2008 period included an increase of approximately 150,000 barrels per day from the project start-up earlier in the year at Agbami in Nigeria and the ramp-up of production associated with the expansion project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Production was lower in Azerbaijan, Thailand and Venezuela. The net liquids component of production increased 2 percent from a year ago to 1.34 million barrels per day, while natural gas production increased 2 percent to 3.49 billion cubic feet per day.
     
U.S. Downstream
     U.S. downstream earned approximately $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with a loss of $55 million a year earlier. The improvement between periods was mainly the result of significantly higher margins on the sale of refined products, improved refinery operations and gains on commodity derivative instruments.
 
     Refinery crude-input of 930,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2008 was 92,000 higher than the corresponding 2007 period. The increase was primarily due to significantly less planned and unplanned downtime in this year's fourth quarter.
     Refined-product sales volumes declined 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 to 1.4 million barrels per day, primarily the result of lower gasoline and fuel oil sales. Branded gasoline sales volumes of 606,000 barrels per day were down 2 percent between quarters.
     
International Downstream
     International downstream income of $1.05 billion increased $788 million from the 2007 quarter due largely to gains on commodity derivative instruments and improved margins on the sale of refined products. These benefits were partially offset by lower refined-product sales volumes. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings by $27 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with a benefit of $87 million a year earlier.
     Refinery crude-input was 973,000 barrels per day, about 6 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 2007 due to an increase in planned and unplanned downtime.
     Refined-product sales volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day in the 2008 fourth quarter were about 6 percent lower than a year earlier due primarily to reduced sales of gasoline, gas oil and fuel oil.
     Chemical operations earned $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $69 million in the year-ago period. Earnings were lower for the company's 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). The decline was partially offset by improved results for Chevron's Oronite subsidiary.
     All Other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels and technology companies, and the company's interest in Dynegy Inc. prior to its sale in May 2007.
 
     Net charges in the fourth quarter 2008 were $365 million, compared with $237 million in the year-ago period. Foreign-currency effects increased net charges by $126 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with a benefit of $4 million in the year-ago period.
     Capital and exploratory expenditures for the year 2008 were $22.8 billion, compared with $20.0 billion in 2007. The amounts included approximately $2.3 billion in each year for the company's share of expenditures by affiliates, which did not require cash outlays by Chevron's consolidated companies. Expenditures for upstream projects represented about 75 percent of the companywide total in 2008.
