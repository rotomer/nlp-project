NEWS RELEASE
 - 
Upstream earnings of $1.52 billion decline 79 percent on lower prices for crude oil and natural gas
 - 
Project start-ups contribute to 5 percent increase in net oil-equivalent production from year ago
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported earnings of $1.75 billion ($0.87 per share  diluted) for the second quarter 2009, compared with $5.98 billion ($2.90 per share  diluted) in the 2008 second quarter. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings in the 2009 quarter by $453 million, compared with a benefit to income of $126 million a year earlier.
SAN RAMON, Calif., July 31, 2009
     For the first half of 2009, earnings were $3.58 billion ($1.79 per share  diluted), down 68 percent from $11.14 billion ($5.38 per share  diluted) in the first six months of 2008.
     Sales and other operating revenues in the second quarter 2009 were $40 billion, compared with $81 billion in the year-ago quarter. First-half 2009 revenues were $75 billion, versus $146 billion in the corresponding 2008 period. The decline in both comparative periods was primarily due to lower prices for refined products, crude oil and natural gas.
     "Operationally, we had another very successful quarter," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "In our upstream business, we had major project start-ups at Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico and Frade offshore Brazil, and our company's net oil-equivalent production increased 5 percent from a year ago. In our downstream operations, refinery utilization was higher than in last year's second quarter."
     O'Reilly said a 79 percent drop in upstream quarterly earnings, which was driven by lower prices for crude oil and natural gas, was offset only partially by improved results in the downstream segment.
 
"Although our downstream results were better than a year ago, the demand for refined products remained generally weak," O'Reilly added. "Sales margins in this year's second quarter were narrow, and our U.S. downstream business operated at a loss." On a companywide basis, O'Reilly said aggressive cost-management efforts resulted in about a 15 percent decrease in recurring operating, selling, general and administrative expenses between periods.
     In additional comments on upstream activities, O'Reilly said another deepwater project is expected to start up this year at 31 percent-owned Tombua-Landana in Angola. Total maximum oil-equivalent production of approximately 100,000 barrels per day is projected to be reached in 2011. Recent milestones for other upstream projects were achieved in:
     Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.67 million barrels per day in the second quarter 2009, up 133,000 barrels per day, or about 5 percent, from 2.54 million in the 2008 second quarter. The increase was driven by project start-ups since last year's second quarter and the impact of lower prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty volumes in certain production contracts outside the United States. Production quotas imposed by OPEC curtailed company crude-oil production in the 2009 second quarter by about 35,000 barrels per day.
 
     
U.S. Upstream
     U.S. upstream earnings of $273 million in the second quarter of 2009 were down $1.9 billion from a year earlier on sharply lower prices for crude oil and natural gas. Operating expenses were lower between periods, but this benefit to income was more than offset by higher depreciation expense, including charges of approximately $100 million for asset impairments in this year's second quarter.
     The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was approximately $50 in the 2009 quarter, compared with $109 a year ago. The average sales price of natural gas was $3.27 per thousand cubic feet, down from $9.84 in last year's second quarter.
     Net oil-equivalent production of 700,000 barrels per day was down 2,000 from the second quarter 2008. A production increase of approximately 60,000 barrels per day between periods was associated with the late-2008 start-up of the Blind Faith Field and the start-up in this year's second quarter of the Tahiti Field, both in the Gulf of Mexico. This impact was offset, however, by normal field declines, production shut in as a result of last year's hurricanes and asset sales. The net liquids component of production was up about 7 percent to 467,000 barrels per day. Net natural-gas production of 1.40 billion cubic feet per day in the 2009 quarter declined 12 percent between periods, with most of the decrease associated with normal field declines, asset sales and the hurricane effects.
     
International Upstream
     International upstream earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $3.8 billion from the second quarter 2008 due mainly to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas. Foreign-currency effects decreased earnings by $476 million in the 2009 period, compared with an increase of $80 million in last year's second quarter. Depreciation expenses were higher between periods, and the 2009 quarter included charges of about $100 million for exploratory well write-offs.
     The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 2009 quarter was $53, compared with $110 a year earlier. The average price of natural gas was $3.73 per thousand cubic feet, down from $5.44 in last year's second quarter.
     Net oil-equivalent production of 1.97 million barrels per day in the second quarter 2009 was up 7 percent, or 135,000 barrels per day, from a year ago. Included in the increase was about 185,000 barrels per day of production associated with the start-up since last year's second quarter of two major projects in Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Decreases to production between periods resulted mainly from OPEC-related
 
curtailments of 35,000 barrels per day, 30,000 barrels per day that were offline due to civil unrest in the onshore area of Nigeriaabout 25,000 barrels per day of lower oil-equivalent natural gas production in Thailand and the effect of normal field declines. The impact of lower prices on cost-recovery volumes and other contractual provisions affecting Chevron's share of production resulted in a net increase of about 85,000 barrels per day between periods. The net liquids component of production increased about 11 percent from a year ago to 1.37 million barrels per day, while net natural gas production declined about 1 percent to 3.59 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. Downstream
     U.S. downstream operations incurred a loss of $95 million in the second quarter 2009, compared with a loss of $682 million a year earlier. Margins on the sales of refined products were weak in both periods. Operating expenses declined from last year's second quarter, which included higher expenses associated with planned shutdowns for refinery maintenance. Refinery crude-input of 923,000 barrels per day in the second quarter 2009 increased 13 percent, or 107,000 barrels per day, from the year-ago period.
     Refined-product sales volumes increased 4 percent from the second quarter of 2008 to 1.44 million barrels per day primarily due to higher gasoline sales. Branded gasoline sales volumes were up 7 percent between quarters to 639,000 barrels per day.
     
International Downstream
     International downstream operations earned $256 million in the second quarter 2009, compared with a loss of $52 million a year earlier. Margins on the sale of refined products improved in most areas, due mainly to a decrease in crude-oil feedstock costs. Operating expenses were lower between the quarterly periods. Earnings in the second quarter 2009 included gains of approximately $140 million associated with asset sales. Foreign-currency effects reduced earnings by $25 million in the 2009 quarter, compared with a $46 million benefit a year earlier.
     Refinery crude-input was 970,000 barrels per day in the 2009 second quarter, up 18,000 from the year-ago period. Total refined-product sales volumes of 1.82 million barrels per day in the 2009 second quarter were 12 percent lower than a year earlier, due mainly to asset sales since the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of 2009 asset sales, sales volumes were down 5 percent between periods primarily due to lower demand for jet fuel and fuel oil.
 
     Chemical operations earned $108 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Earnings of the 50-percent owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and Chevron's Oronite subsidiary were both higher between periods. For CPChem, lower utility and manufacturing costs were partially offset by lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals. For Oronite, higher margins on the sale of lubricant and fuel additives more than offset the effect of lower volumes.
     All Other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, alternative fuels and technology companies.
     Net charges in the second quarter 2009 were $43 million, compared with $580 million in the year-ago period. The change between periods included lower charges for environmental remediation at sites that previously had been closed or sold, a favorable change in corporate tax items and lower charges for employee compensation and benefits.
     Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first six months of 2009 were $11.4 billion, composed of outlays of $6.5 billion in the first quarter and $4.9 billion in the second quarter. Expenditures for upstream projects represented 80 percent of the six-month total. Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first six months of 2008 were $10.3 billion. Refer to Attachment 2 for expenditure detail by business segment.
