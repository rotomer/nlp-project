Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
EXHIBIT 99.1
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported in its interim update that earnings for the first quarter 2011 are expected to be higher than in the fourth quarter 2010. Upstream results are projected to improve between sequential quarters, benefiting from higher crude oil prices, offset in part by lower liftings. Downstream earnings in the first quarter are expected to be slightly lower, reflecting reduced asset sales gains, largely offset by higher U.S. margins.

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update
     The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the first quarter 2011. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not necessarily indicative of Chevron's full quarterly results to be reported on April 29, 2011. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data.
     Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on of the first quarter 2011 versus fourth quarter 2010 results.

     The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.
 
 
     U.S. net oil-equivalent production was lower during the first two months of the first quarter, decreasing by 12,000 barrels per day compared with the fourth quarter 2010 average, reflecting small declines across multiple assets. International net oil-equivalent production declined 26,000 barrels per day during the first two months of the first quarter. An increase in crude oil prices during this period reduced the company's production under cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions on certain international production contracts. Maintenance activity in Angola and weather-related downtime in Australia and the United Kingdom also adversely impacted production.
     U.S. crude oil realizations increased $8.67 to $88.23 per barrel during the first two months of the first quarter. International liquids realizations improved by $12.24 to $91.33 per barrel, with the earnings benefit from higher realizations partly offset by lower liftings. U.S. and international natural gas realizations increased $0.50 and $0.15 per thousand cubic feet, respectively.
 
     The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining, marketing and chemical margins. Actual margins realized by the company will differ due to crude and product mix effects, planned and unplanned shutdown activity and other company-specific and operational factors.
Prices, economics, and views expressed by CMAI are strictly the opinion of CMAI and Purvin & Gertz and are based on information collected within the public domain and on assessments by CMAI and Purvin & Gertz staff utilizing reasonable care consistent with normal industry practice. CMAI and Purvin & Gertz make no guarantee or warranty and assume no liability as to their use.
Note:
     For the full first quarter, worldwide refining margins improved compared with fourth quarter 2010, with the exception of N.W. Europe. Marketing margins were mixed, while chemical indicator margins improved between periods.
     During the first two months of the first quarter, U.S. refinery crude-input volumes decreased 6,000 barrels per day due to maintenance activities at mulitple refineries. Outside the United States, refinery crude-input volumes were in-line with fourth quarter 2010 results.
     Downstream earnings in the first quarter are expected to be negatively impacted by mark-to-market effects on open derivative contracts tied to underlying physical positions.
 
     The company's general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges related to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and $350 million. Due to foreign currency effects and the potential for irregularly occurring accruals related to income taxes, pension settlements and other matters, actual results may significantly differ from the guidance range. Total net charges in the first quarter are expected to be at the high end of the guidance range.
Chevron's discussion of first quarter 2011 earnings with security analysts will take place on Friday, April 29, 2011, at 8:00 a.m. PDT. A webcast of the meeting will be available in a listen-only mode to individual investors, media, and other interested parties on Chevron's website at
under the "Investors" section. Additional financial and operating information will be contained in the Earnings Supplement that will be available under "Events & Presentations" in the "Investors" section on the website.
