Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed to update the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Chevron Corporation ("Chevron") on June 1, 2011 (the "Original Report") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose, as required by SEC regulations, Chevron's decision regarding the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes on the compensation of its named executive officers. No changes have been made to the Original Report.
 
(d) As reported in the Original Report, at Chevron's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 25, 2011, 84.2% of the votes cast by stockholders were voted, on an advisory basis, in favor of holding future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation every year. In light of these results, Chevron's Board of Directors has decided that future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation will be held every year until the next advisory vote on the frequency of such votes, which in accordance with applicable law, will occur no later than Chevron's Annual Meeting in 2017.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
