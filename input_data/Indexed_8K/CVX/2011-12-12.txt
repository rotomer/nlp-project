(e) On December 6, 2011, the Management Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the following grants of restricted stock units under the Chevron Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") to the following named executive officers: R. Hewitt Pate, 22,500 shares which vest thirty percent on the third anniversary of the date of grant, thirty percent on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, and forty percent on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant; Michael K. Wirth, 15,000 shares which vest fifty percent on the second anniversary of the date of grant and fifty percent on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant; and Patricia E. Yarrington, 15,000 shares which vest fifty percent on the second anniversary of the date of grant and fifty percent on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. The restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units and payout in cash based on the closing stock price on the date of vesting. Prior to payout, the restricted stock units will be canceled if the grantee is terminated for "Misconduct" as defined in the LTIP, unless the Committee determines otherwise. In addition, the Corporation may demand forfeiture of any payout of restricted stock units that occurred after the date of the Misconduct.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
