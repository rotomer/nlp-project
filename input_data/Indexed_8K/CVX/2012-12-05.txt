Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions contained in the document entitled "Chevron Corporation Debt Securities Underwriting Standard Provisions," a copy of which is attached hereto, are incorporated herein.
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), each Underwriter hereby represents that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the "Relevant Implementation Date"), it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State other than: (a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive; (b) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors, as defined in the Prospectus Directive, as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the representatives for any such offers); or (c) in any other circumstances falling within Article (3)(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no such offer of the Notes shall require Chevron or any Underwriters to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For purposes of this section, the expression an "offer of the Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any
 
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State; and "2010 PD Amending Directive" means Directive 2010/73/EU.
Each Underwriter hereby represents that, in connection with the distribution of the Notes, it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") of the United Kingdom) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes or any investments representing the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to Chevron and that it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
Each Underwriter hereby represents that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any Notes by means of any document other than (i) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong), (ii) to "professional investors" within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a "prospectus" within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to Notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to "professional investors" within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan (the "Financial Instruments and Exchange Law") and each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that it will not offer or sell any Notes, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan), or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.
Each Underwriter hereby agrees that it will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Notes in any jurisdiction outside the United States except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws thereof, and that it will take at its own expense whatever action is required to permit its resale of the Notes in such jurisdictions. Each Underwriter understands that no action has been taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction outside the United States where action would be required for such purpose. Each Underwriter agrees not to cause any advertisement of the Notes to be published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and not to issue any circular relating to the Notes, except in any such case with the prior express written consent of Chevron and of the Representatives and then only at its own risk and expense.
Please confirm your agreement by executing a copy of this Underwriting Agreement in the space set forth below and returning the signed copy to the Undersigned.

From time to time, Chevron Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Chevron"), may enter into one or more underwriting agreements that provide for the sale of certain debt securities (the "Securities"), to the purchaser or purchasers named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"). The standard provisions set forth herein may be incorporated by reference in any such underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"). The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as this "Agreement." Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as therein defined. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings given them in the Indenture (as hereinafter defined).
The terms governing the issuance and sale of any particular series of Securities shall be as provided in the applicable Underwriting Agreement (with respect to each Underwriting Agreement, such series of Securities are herein referred to as the "Designated Securities") and in the Indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of June 15, 1995, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2012 each being between Chevron and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee").
Sales of the Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of the Designated Securities. Any firm or firms designated as the representative or representatives, as the case may be, of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities in the Underwriting Agreement relating thereto will act as the representative or representatives (collectively, the "Representatives"). The obligation of Chevron to issue and sell any of the Designated Securities and the obligation of any Underwriters to purchase any of the Designated Securities shall be evidenced by the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Underwriting Agreement shall incorporate by reference a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet"), which shall specify the final terms of the Designated Securities, including as applicable the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, the public offering price of the Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives, if any, of such Underwriters, the principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and the terms of any Delayed Delivery Contract (as hereinafter defined), the date, time and manner of delivery of the Designated Securities and payment therefor and, to the extent not set forth in the Registration Statement or a Preliminary Prospectus (each as hereinafter defined) with respect thereto, the general terms of the Designated Securities. An Underwriting Agreement shall be in writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of facsimile transmissions or any other transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under each Underwriting Agreement shall be several and not joint.
Section 1. Issuance of Designated Securities.
If Chevron agrees, the Underwriters may solicit offers to purchase the Designated Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") in a form agreed upon by Chevron. The Underwriters shall be paid their specified commission for Delayed Delivery Contracts upon
 
 
the full performance of the Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Delayed Delivery Contracts are invalid or are not fully performed, then the Underwriters shall not be entitled to any compensation for their efforts in securing such Delayed Delivery Contracts.
If the Delayed Delivery Contracts are executed, valid and fully performed, the Designated Securities delivered pursuant to them shall be deducted from the Designated Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Designated Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in the Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than in such proportion and so advise Chevron in writing; provided, however, that the total principal amount of securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the aggregate principal amount set forth in the appropriate schedule thereto, less the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities to be delivered pursuant to the delayed delivery provisions.
Chevron represents to, and covenants with, each Underwriter that:
Section 2. Representations and Covenants.
(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-184777), including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") relating to the Securities, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with applicable regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and has become effective under the Act. Such registration statement, as amended as of the Applicable Time specified in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Applicable Time") and including any prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act and deemed to be part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement." The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement to reflect the final terms of the Designated Securities and the offering thereof, as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as the "Final Prospectus." The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus which describes the Designated Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to the Applicable Time, as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, is hereinafter referred to as a "Preliminary Prospectus." The Base Prospectus, as supplemented and amended as of the Applicable Time, including without limitation by the Final Term Sheet and the Preliminary Prospectus (if any) used most recently prior to the Applicable Time, is hereinafter referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, a Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents which were filed by Chevron on or prior to the date thereof under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference therein, excluding any documents or portions of such documents which are deemed under the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act not to be incorporated by reference therein; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, a Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act deemed to be incorporated therein by reference after the date thereof. The term "Effective Date" means with respect to any part of the Registration Statement the date such part becomes effective under the Act.
 
 
(b) The Registration Statement conforms, each part of the Registration Statement relating to the Designated Securities (as of its Effective Date) conformed, the Final Prospectus (as of its date and the Closing Date) will conform, and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto relating to the Designated Securities (as of their respective dates) will conform, in all material respects, to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; each document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus complied when so filed as to form with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; the Indenture conforms in all material respects to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; the Registration Statement does not, and each part of the Registration Statement relating to the Designated Securities (as of its Effective Date) did not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; the Pricing Disclosure Package (as of the Applicable Time) did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; the Final Prospectus (as of its date and the Closing Date) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that Chevron makes no representations as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility and Qualifications (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act or (ii) any statements or omissions in any such document made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to Chevron by or on behalf of any Underwriter for use in connection with the preparation of such document.
(c) As of (i) the time the Registration Statement was filed; (ii) the time of the most recent amendment thereto for purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus); and (iii) the time Chevron or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for purposes of this clause only, of Rule 163) made any offer of the Designated Securities in reliance on Rule 163, Chevron was a "well-known seasoned issuer," as such term is defined in Rule 405.
(d) As of the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement at which Chevron or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of any Designated Securities, Chevron was not an "ineligible issuer," as such term is defined in Rule 405.
(e) Other than the Final Term Sheet, without the prior written consent of the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that (i) would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as such term is defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act (an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") or (ii) would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (a "Free Writing Prospectus").
(f) Neither the Final Term Sheet nor any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus includes any information that conflicts with any information contained in the
 
 
Registration Statement (other than information that otherwise has been superseded or modified); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) any statements or omissions in any such document made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to Chevron by or on behalf of any Underwriter for use in connection with the preparation of such document or (ii) any free writing prospectus issued by an Underwriter in violation of Section 5(a).
Delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities (except for Designated Securities to be delivered under Delayed Delivery Contracts) shall be made at the place, on the date and at the time specified in the Underwriting Agreement (the "Closing Date"), which Closing Date may be postponed by agreement between the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, and Chevron. Delivery of the Designated Securities shall be made to the Underwriters or, if appropriate, the Representatives for the respective accounts of the Underwriters, in either case, against payment by the Underwriters directly or through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of Chevron by either wire transfer of immediately available funds or by certified or official bank check or checks payable in New York Clearing House funds, unless otherwise agreed in the Underwriting Agreement. Unless issued in Global Form, certificates for the Designated Securities shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Underwriters or, if appropriate, the Representatives, may request in writing not less than three full business days in advance of the Closing Date. If issued as Global Securities, the Designated Securities shall be issued in the form and registered to the Depository or its order, all as provided in the Indenture.
Section 3. Delivery and Payment.
If so requested by the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, Chevron agrees to have the Designated Securities available for inspection, checking and packaging in New York, New York, at least one business day prior to the Closing Date.
It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Designated Securities for sale to the public upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package.
Section 4. Offering by Underwriters.
Chevron and the Underwriters agree that:
Section 5. Agreements.
(a) Chevron will cause the Final Term Sheet to be filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act. Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees that without the prior written consent of Chevron it will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as such term is defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by Chevron with the Commission or retained by Chevron under Rule 433, other than the Final Term Sheet.
(b) Chevron will cause the Final Prospectus to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act and will promptly advise the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, when the Final Prospectus has been so filed, and prior to the termination of the offering of the Designated Securities will promptly advise such Underwriters or Representatives (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement has become effective or any further supplement to the Final Prospectus has been filed, (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any notice objecting to the use of the Registration Statement; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose; and (v) of
 
 
the receipt by Chevron of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Designated Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Chevron will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. Chevron will not file any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the prospectus relating to the Designated Securities unless it has furnished the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, a copy prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which such Underwriters or Representatives reasonably object.
(c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424, any event occurs as a result of which the Pricing Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Chevron will promptly notify the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be. If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Designated Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) or any other applicable securities law, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, Chevron will promptly notify the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, and will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance.
(d) Chevron will make generally available to its security holders and to the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of Chevron and its consolidated subsidiaries, covering a twelve-month period beginning after the date of the Underwriting Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act (including Rule 158 thereunder).
(e) Chevron will furnish to the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, and counsel for such Underwriters or Representatives copies of the Registration Statement (including, if requested, the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto relating to the Designated Securities which is thereafter filed pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 5 and to each Underwriter, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172) or any other applicable securities law, as many copies of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto, in each case relating to the Designated Securities, as such Underwriters may reasonably request.
(f) Chevron will pay (i) all expenses incurred by it in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation any Commission filing fees
 
 
due pursuant to Rule 456(b)), (ii) reasonable fees charged for rating the Designated Securities and for preparing a Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memorandum with respect to the sale of the Designated Securities and (iii) the expenses of printing or otherwise producing and delivering the Designated Securities, the documents specified in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 and any Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memorandum.
(g) Chevron will use its best efforts to arrange and pay for the qualification of the Designated Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Designated Securities; provided, however, that Chevron shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(h) If the sale of the Designated Securities provided for in an Underwriting Agreement is not consummated by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of Chevron to perform any agreement on its part to be performed (except for any failure so to perform on the part of Chevron engendered by a failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Underwriters or any Representatives to perform any agreement on their part to be performed) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6, Chevron will reimburse the several Underwriters who are named in such Underwriting Agreement for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements incurred by the Underwriters in connection with their investigation, marketing and preparing to market the Designated Securities, and upon such reimbursement Chevron shall have no further liability to the Underwriters except as provided in Section 7.
(i) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and terminating on the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date of the termination of trading restrictions, if any, with respect to the Designated Securities imposed by any Agreement Among Underwriters, Chevron will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of Chevron substantially similar to the Designated Securities covered by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of such Underwriters or Representatives.
(j) If a letter delivered to the Underwriters or the Representatives pursuant to paragraph (e) of Section 6 of this Agreement has attached thereto a copy of unaudited interim financial statements for a period ending after the latest financial statements included in the Registration Statement, and if such financial statements have not been publicly disclosed, such Underwriters or Representatives shall keep such attachment in strict confidence and not furnish such attachment to any other Underwriter or to any other person; provided, however, that if an action of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) of Section 7 of this Agreement is commenced against any person who may be entitled to indemnification or contribution under such section, the Underwriters or Representatives may furnish a copy of such attachment to each of the other Underwriters.
The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Designated Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations on the part of Chevron contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the performance by Chevron of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Section 6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters.
 
 
(a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted and be pending or threatened as of the Closing Date and no notice objecting to the use of the Registration Statement shall have been issued by the Commission;

(1) The representations of Chevron in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date, and Chevron has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;

(3) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of Chevron and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor any material increase in the debt of Chevron Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or as described in the certificate.
(e) The Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, shall have received from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP a letter, dated the Closing Date, which letter shall be in form as may be agreed upon among such Underwriters or Representatives, Chevron and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and shall cover such matters as may be reasonably requested by such Underwriters or Representatives.

Section 7. Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) Chevron agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in each case relating to the Designated Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as so incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that Chevron will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (i) any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Chevron by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, for use in connection with the preparation thereof or (ii) any free writing prospectus issued by an underwriter in violation of Section 5(a). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Chevron may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Chevron, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls Chevron within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Chevron to each Underwriter, but only with reference to (i) information furnished in writing to Chevron by or on behalf of such Underwriter directly or through the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity and (ii) any free writing prospectus issued by an Underwriter in violation of Section 5(a). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which
 
 
it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel, to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the representatives representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from Chevron or the Underwriters on grounds of policy or otherwise, Chevron and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which Chevron or one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of the Final Prospectus bears to the public offering price appearing thereon and Chevron is responsible for the balance; provided that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Designated Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Designated Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls Chevron within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of Chevron who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of Chevron shall have the same rights to contribution as Chevron, subject in each case to clause (y) of this
 
 
paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify in writing such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, by written notice given to Chevron prior to delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any material outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of such Underwriters or Representatives, impracticable to market the Designated Securities.
Section 8. Termination.
The respective agreements, representations, indemnities and other statements of Chevron, or its officers and of the Underwriters and/or any Representatives set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, Chevron or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 5(f) and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Section 9. Representations and Indemnities to Survive.
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any Designated Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Designated Securities set forth opposite their names in the appropriate schedule of the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Designated Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Designated Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Designated Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the amount of Designated Securities set forth in the appropriate schedule of the Underwriting Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Designated Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Designated Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or Chevron. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Underwriters or the Representatives, as the case may be, shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to Chevron and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Section 10. Default by an Underwriter.
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Section 11. Successors.
 
 
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities, of the Series designated
herein, described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of Chevron, not limited in aggregate principal amount, all issued or to be issued in one or more series of varying dates, numbers, interest rates and other provisions, under an Indenture dated as of June 15, 1995, as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2012 (such indenture as so amended being herein referred to as the "Indenture") each being between Chevron and the Trustee. This Note is one of a series of Notes designated as its "1.104% Notes Due 2017" aggregating $2,000,000,000 in principal amount (herein called the "Notes").
Reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a description of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of Chevron, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, to all of the provisions of which Indenture the registered owner of this Note, by acceptance hereof, assents and agrees. The Indenture contains provisions permitting Chevron and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which term is defined in the Indenture as any security or securities of Chevron, authenticated and delivered under the Indenture) at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) and affected by such supplemental indenture, to execute one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security (including the Notes) affected thereby: (1) change the fixed maturity or redemption date of any Note, or reduce the rate of interest on any Note or the method of determining such rate of interest or extend the time of payment of interest, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which the Notes or the interest thereon is payable or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, (2) reduce the aforesaid percentage of holders of the Outstanding Securities whose consent is required for the execution of such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the holders of which is required for any waiver provided for in the Indenture or (3) change the time of payment. It is also provided in the Indenture that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may waive (a) compliance by Chevron with the covenants contained in Article Four of the Indenture with respect to the Notes and (b) any past or existing Event of Default with respect to the Notes and its consequences except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Notes or in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the registered owner of the Note so affected.
Prior to November 5, 2017, the Notes shall be subject to redemption, at the option of Chevron, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including the portion of any such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus interest accrued on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. On or after November 5, 2017, the Notes shall be subject to redemption, at the option of Chevron, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus interest accrued on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. The "Adjusted Treasury Rate" is to be determined on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date and means (1) the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the Statistical Release (hereinafter defined) most recently published prior to the date of determination under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month) corresponding to the remaining term, as of the applicable redemption date, of the Notes being redeemed plus (2) 0.075%. If no maturity set forth under such heading exactly corresponds to the remaining term of the Notes being redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the remaining term of the Notes being redeemed will be calculated as described in the preceding sentence, and the Adjusted Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding each of the relevant period to the nearest month. The term "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designation "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively-traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any determination under the terms of the Notes, then such other reasonably comparable index as Chevron shall designate. As provided in the Indenture, notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owners of Notes to be redeemed by mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to their addresses as they appear on the register books.
If an Event of Default (as that term is defined in the Indenture) shall occur, the principal of all Notes and the interest accrued thereon may be declared due and payable upon the conditions, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding.
The Notes are issuable in registered form in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate amount of Notes of other authorized denominations as provided in the Indenture. This Note is transferable at the office of the Trustee by the registered owner hereof in person, or by such registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, on the books of Chevron at said office, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges provided in the Indenture, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Note. Upon such transfer a new fully registered Note or Notes of authorized denomination or denominations, for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor.
Chevron, the Trustee and any agent of Chevron or the Trustee and any paying agent may treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone other than Chevron or the Trustee) for the purpose of receiving payment hereof or on account hereof and for all other purposes, and none of Chevron, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
THIS NOTE AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHEVRON IN RESPECT HEREOF ARE GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of Chevron or of any successor of Chevron, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
 
Unless this Note is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York Corporation ("DTC"), to Chevron Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment and any Note issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co., or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL, inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
CHEVRON CORPORATION (herein referred to as "Chevron"), a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000) on December 5, 2022 in lawful money of the United States of America and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) thereon in like money from December 5, 2012 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (hereinafter defined) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for until payment of such principal sum, at the rate of 2.355% per annum, payable on each June 5 and December 5, commencing June 5, 2013 (the "Interest Payment Dates").
The principal hereof is payable upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the principal office of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee"). Interest on this Note may be payable by check or draft mailed to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest payment at such person's address as it appears on the registration books of the Trustee. The Record Date for the Notes is the date which is 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.
REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS NOTE SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF FULLY SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.
This Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture (hereinafter defined), or become valid or obligatory for any purpose, until the Certificate of Authentication hereon endorsed shall have been executed by manual signature by the Trustee.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, CHEVRON CORPORATION has caused this Note to be signed by its Assistant Treasurer manually or in facsimile and its corporate seal to be imprinted hereon and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting Chevron and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which term is defined in the Indenture as any security or securities of Chevron, authenticated and delivered under the Indenture) at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) and affected by such supplemental indenture, to execute one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holder of each Outstanding Security (including the Notes) affected thereby: (1) change the fixed maturity or redemption date of any Note, or reduce the rate of interest on any Note or the method of determining such rate of interest or extend the time of payment of interest, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce any premium payable on the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which the Notes or the interest thereon is payable or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, (2) reduce the aforesaid percentage of holders of the Outstanding Securities whose consent is required for the execution of such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the holders of which is required for any waiver provided for in the Indenture or (3) change the time of payment. It is also provided in the Indenture that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may waive (a) compliance by Chevron with the covenants contained in Article Four of the Indenture with respect to the Notes and (b) any past or existing Event of Default with respect to the Notes and its consequences except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Notes or in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the registered owner of the Note so affected.
Prior to September 5, 2022, the Notes shall be subject to redemption, at the option of Chevron, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including the portion of any such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis, calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus interest accrued on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. On or after September 5, 2022, the Notes shall be subject to redemption, at the option of Chevron, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus interest accrued on the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. The "Adjusted Treasury Rate" is to be determined on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date and means (1) the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the Statistical Release (hereinafter defined) most recently published prior to the date of determination under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month) corresponding to the remaining term, as of the applicable redemption date, of the Notes being redeemed plus (2) 0.120%. If no maturity set forth under such heading exactly corresponds to the remaining term of the Notes being redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the remaining term of the Notes being redeemed will be calculated as described in the preceding sentence, and the Adjusted Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding each of the relevant period to the nearest month. The term "Statistical Release" means the statistical release designation "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively-traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities, or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any determination under the terms of the Notes, then such other reasonably comparable index as Chevron shall designate. As provided in the Indenture, notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owners of Notes to be redeemed by mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to their addresses as they appear on the register books.
If an Event of Default (as that term is defined in the Indenture) shall occur, the principal of all Notes and the interest accrued thereon may be declared due and payable upon the conditions, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that in certain events such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding.
The Notes are issuable in registered form in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate amount of Notes of other authorized denominations as provided in the Indenture. This Note is transferable at the office of the Trustee by the registered owner hereof in person, or by such registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, on the books of Chevron at said office, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges provided in the Indenture, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Note. Upon such transfer a new fully registered Note or Notes of authorized denomination or denominations, for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor.
Chevron, the Trustee and any agent of Chevron or the Trustee and any paying agent may treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made by anyone other than Chevron or the Trustee) for the purpose of receiving payment hereof or on account hereof and for all other purposes, and none of Chevron, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
THIS NOTE AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHEVRON IN RESPECT HEREOF ARE GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Note or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of Chevron or of any successor of Chevron, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

Gentlemen and Mesdames:
We are acting as counsel for Chevron Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance by the Company of $2,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 1.104% Notes Due 2017 and $2,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2.355% Notes Due 2022 (the "Securities") pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-184777) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), on November 6, 2012, and the related base prospectus which forms a part of and is included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated November 28, 2012 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"). The Securities will be issued under the Indenture, dated as of June 15, 1995, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 5, 2012 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), each being between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
We have reviewed and are familiar with such corporate proceedings and other matters as we have deemed necessary for the opinions expressed in this letter. In such review, we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, the Securities will be properly authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized representative of the Trustee, and the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, which assumptions we have not independently verified.
On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued and sold in accordance with the Indenture and as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, receivership, conservatorship, arrangement, moratorium and other laws affecting and relating to the rights of the creditors generally, by general equitable principles and by requirements of reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and materiality.
The opinions set forth in this letter are limited to matters governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of New York, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and the incorporation thereof in the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Opinions" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
