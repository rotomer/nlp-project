RICHMOND, Va., July 17, 2003 - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today consolidated operating earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, of $265 million (84 cents per share), compared to operating earnings of $272 million (97 cents per share) for the same period in 2002.
Second-quarter earnings prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), or reported earnings, were $240 million (76 cents per share) compared to $272 million (97 cents per share) last year.
Second quarter 2003 operating earnings exclude the after-tax impact of a $25 million (8 cents per share) impairment of certain assets held for sale. Second quarter 2002 reported earnings equaled operating earnings.
Dominion utilizes operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the Board of Directors and for the company's profit sharing plan. Dominion management believes that the company's operating earnings figure provides a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.
Thos. E. Capps, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
"Second quarter results were strong, despite significantly milder than normal weather conditions, which reduced earnings 8 cents per share compared to normal and 15 cents per share compared to last year. Year-to-date, operating earnings per share of $2.35 are 9 percent ahead of last year and cash flow from operations has increased to about $1.5 billion compared to $832 million during the same period last year. We are reaffirming operating earnings guidance of $4.60 to $4.80 per share in 2003 and 5-percent to 7-percent average annual growth after 2003."
Year-to-date reported earnings per share of $2.39 are 11 percent ahead of 2002.
In reaffirming operating earnings guidance of $4.60 to $4.80 per share, Dominion management is aware of potential differences going forward between 2003 reported and operating earnings due to changes resulting from the implementation of recently issued accounting standards. At this time Dominion management is still reviewing the effect of these recently issued accounting standards and has not fully determined the impact on its financial statements. Therefore, Dominion is not able at this time to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for 2003 earnings guidance figures.
 
In other second-quarter highlights Dominion:
Served an additional 40,000 franchise gas and electric utility customers compared to the same period last year, transporting and delivering nearly 17 million megawatt-hours of electricity and more than 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas to the company's 3.9 million franchise customers during the quarter;
Completed replacement of nuclear reactor vessel heads for North Anna Unit One in April in 54 days and for Surry Unit One in June in 58 days; and
Added 300 billion cubic feet equivalent to proved gas and oil reserves, a quarterly replacement ratio of 265 percent, bringing total proved reserves to nearly 6.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent.
 
Second-quarter operating earnings breakdown by segment
 
2002 segment results have been restated for comparison purposes to reflect the transfer of the electric transmission operations from Dominion Delivery to Dominion Energy.
Dominion Energy earned $176 million (56 cents per share) in the second quarter compared to $189 million (67 cents per share) in the second quarter of 2002. The change resulted primarily from milder weather in the electric franchise area, a change in the allocation of electric franchise base revenues, the effect of corporate hedges on natural gas production and other factors including share dilution, partially offset by Millstone's contribution and customer growth.
Dominion Delivery earned $52 million (17 cents per share) in the second quarter compared to $55 million (19 cents per share) for the second quarter 2002. The change is primarily attributable to milder weather in the electric and gas franchise areas partially offset by customer growth, a change in the allocation of electric franchise base revenues and other factors including share dilution.
Dominion Exploration & Production (E&P) earned $95 million (30 cents per share) in the second quarter compared to $92 million (33 cents per share) in the second quarter of 2002. The benefit of higher average realized prices was offset by higher expenses, the expiration of Section 29 production tax credits and share dilution.
Corporate segment impact on second quarter 2003 operating earnings, including Dominion Capital, was negative $58 million (19 cents per share) compared to negative $64 million (22 cents per share) in the second quarter of 2002. The change is attributable to lower expenses and share dilution partially offset by reduced earnings of Dominion Capital. The corporate segment's second quarter 2003 earnings impact under GAAP was negative $83 million (27 cents per share). Corporate segment operating earnings exclude the $25 million after-tax impact (8 cents per share) of an impairment of certain assets held for sale. Reported earnings were the same as operating earnings in the second quarter 2002.
Commenting on assets held for sale, Capps said: "We are now entering the final phase of divesting two relatively small energy investments acquired through the Consolidated Natural Gas merger in 2000 that do not fit Dominion's MAIN-to-Maine strategy. The divestitures are expected to raise a modest amount of cash over the next year, which will be used for general corporate purposes."
