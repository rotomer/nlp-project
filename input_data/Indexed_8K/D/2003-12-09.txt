Representations and Warranties of the Company
 
(a) A registration statement, No. 333-106790 on Form S-3 for the registration of the Senior Notes and the Underlying Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), heretofore filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) has become effective. The registration statement, including all exhibits thereto, as amended through the date hereof, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"; the prospectus relating to the Senior Debt Securities, the Common Stock and other securities included in the Registration Statement, which prospectus is now proposed to be supplemented by a prospectus supplement relating to the Senior Notes to be filed with the Commission under the Securities Act, as completed and as so supplemented, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus". As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement" and "Prospectus" include all documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) incorporated therein by reference, and shall include any documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) filed after the date of such Registration Statement or Prospectus and incorporated therein by reference from the date of filing of such incorporated documents (collectively, the Incorporated Documents).
 
(b) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or otherwise preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust Indenture Act), and the rules, regulations and releases of the Commission (the Rules and Regulations); neither the Registration Statement on the date it was declared effective (the Effective Date) nor the Prospectus on the date hereof contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and, on the Closing Date (as defined below), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) will conform in all respects to the requirements of
 
the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that the foregoing representations and warranties in this Section 3(b) shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by the Underwriters or on the Underwriters' behalf through the Representatives for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or the part of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act; and provided further that the foregoing representations and warranties are given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c) Except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement and Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements after the date hereof), since the respective most recent dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements after the date hereof), there has not been any material adverse change or event which would result in a material adverse effect on the condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, financial or otherwise (a Material Adverse Effect). The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole have no material contingent financial obligation which is not disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
 
(d) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have certified certain of the Company's financial statements filed with the Commission and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, are independent public accountants as required by the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations.
 
(e) Consolidated Natural Gas Company, Dominion Exploration & Production, Inc., Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Transmission, Inc. and Virginia Electric and Power Company are the only Significant Subsidiaries of the Company as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable, and, with the exception of the outstanding preferred stock of Virginia Electric and Power Company which is owned by third parties, the capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, claim, encumbrance or equitable right.
 
(f) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, and the Senior Notes (including issuance of the Underlying Securities upon conversion of the Senior Notes in accordance with their terms) and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement (including the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the
 
Senior Notes as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Senior Notes (including issuance of the Underlying Securities upon conversion of the Senior Notes in accordance with their terms) does not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any subsidiary, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or operations, and the Company has full power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Senior Notes as contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(g) The Underlying Securities issuable upon conversion of the Senior Notes have been duly authorized and reserved and, when issued upon conversion of the Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of the Underlying Securities will not be subject to any preemptive or similar rights.
 
(h) The Common Stock (other than the Underlying Securities) is and, upon issuance, the Underlying Securities will be, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
(i) The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Senior Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
4. . On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each of the Underwriters, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the price, place and time hereinafter specified, the principal amount of the Firm Senior Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. The Underwriters agree to make a public offering of their respective Senior Notes specified in Schedule I hereto at the initial public offering price specified in Schedule II hereto. It is understood that after such initial offering the several Underwriters reserve the right to vary the offering price and further reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify any subsequent offering without notice.
Purchase and Public Offering
 
In addition, the Company hereby grants to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to $20,000,000 principal amount of Option Senior Notes. Such option is granted solely for
 
the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Senior Notes and is exercisable as provided herein. Option Senior Notes shall be purchased severally for the account of the Underwriters in proportion to the principal amounts of Firm Senior Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. The respective obligations of each Underwriter with respect to the Option Senior Notes shall be adjusted by the Representatives so that no Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase Option Senior Notes other than in $1,000 principal amounts.
 
The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any of the Senior Notes to be delivered on the First Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the Second Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), as the case may be, except upon payment for all of the Senior Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date as provided herein.
 
5.. Delivery of the certificate(s) for the Senior Notes and payment therefor by the Representatives for the accounts of the several Underwriters shall be made at the time, place and date specified in Schedule II or such other time, place and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, and subject to the provisions of Section 10 hereof. The hour and date of such delivery and payment are herein called the "First Closing Date" or the "Closing Date" as the context implies. On the First Closing Date, the Company, through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (DTC), shall deliver or cause to be delivered a securities entitlement with respect to the Firm Senior Notes to the Representatives for the accounts of each Underwriter against payment of the purchase price by wire transfer of same-day funds to a bank account designated by the Company. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Senior Notes shall be registered in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Time and Place of Closing
 
The option granted in Section 4 may be exercised by the Underwriters giving written notice to the Company of their election to exercise the option and completing the purchase of the Option Senior Notes within 13 days after the First Closing Date (counting the First Closing Date as the first such day). Such notice shall set forth the principal amount of Option Senior Notes as to which the option is being exercised, the denominations in which the Option Senior Notes are to be issued and the date and time, as determined by the Underwriters, when the Option Senior Notes are to be delivered; provided, however, that this date and time shall not be earlier than the First Closing Date nor earlier than the business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised. The date and time the Option Senior Notes are delivered are sometimes referred to herein as the "Second Closing Date" and the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date are sometimes each referred to as a "Closing Date".
 
Delivery of and payment for the Option Senior Notes shall be made at the place specified pursuant to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this Section 5 (or at such other place as shall be determined by agreement between the Underwriters and the Company) at 10:00 a.m., Richmond, Virginia, time on the Second Closing Date. On the Second Closing Date, the Company through the facilities of DTC, shall deliver or cause to be delivered a securities entitlement with respect to the Option Senior Notes to the Representatives for the accounts of each Underwriter against payment of the purchase price by wire transfer of same-day funds to a bank account designated by the Company. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time
 
and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Option Senior Notes shall be registered in the name of CEDE & Co., as nominee of DTC.
 
6. . The Company agrees that:
Covenants of the Company
 
(a) If the Representatives so request, the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, will deliver to the Representatives conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed, including all exhibits, any related preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to each such document, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested by the Representatives. The Representatives will be deemed to have made such a request for copies for each of the several Underwriters and Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, with respect to any such documents that are not electronically available through the Commission's EDGAR filing system.
 
(b) The Company will pay all expenses in connection with (i) the preparation and filing by it of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Senior Notes and the Underlying Securities, (iii) any fees and expenses of the Trustee and (iv) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters, in reasonable quantities, of copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (each as originally filed and as subsequently amended).

(c) If, during the time when a prospectus relating to the Senior Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Underwriters through the Representatives to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Senior Notes and (ii) at its expense, prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. During the period specified above, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the Securities Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; provided, that the Company shall not file such documents or amendments without also furnishing copies thereof to the Representatives and Troutman Sanders LLP.

(d) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement prior to filing; and the Company will also advise the Representatives promptly of the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.
 
(e) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, an earnings statement of the Company (which need not be audited) in reasonable detail, covering a period of at least 12 months beginning within three months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
 
(f) The Company will furnish such information as may be lawfully required and otherwise cooperate in qualifying the Senior Notes for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in any state to qualify as a foreign corporation, or to file a general consent to service of process, or to submit to any requirements which it deems unduly burdensome.
 
(g) Fees and disbursements of Troutman Sanders LLP, who is acting as counsel for the Underwriters, and of Davis Polk & Wardwell, who is acting as special product counsel for the Underwriters (exclusive of fees and disbursements of Troutman Sanders LLP which are to be paid as set forth in Section 6(b)), shall be paid by the Underwriters; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Representatives for the account of the Underwriters for the amount of the fees and disbursements of Troutman Sanders LLP.
 
(h) The Company shall not (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, lend, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of its Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock (collectively, Common Securities), or file any Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to any of the foregoing (other than a shelf registration statement from which no such securities are offered) or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, for a period of 30 days from the date hereof without your prior written consent, other than (A) pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, (B) any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of an option, warrant, or the conversion of a security outstanding on the date hereof; (C) the Company's Treasury PIES

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each such Underwriter, director, officer and controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
 
or liabilities, or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), or any preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that the foregoing indemnity agreement, insofar as it relates to any preliminary Prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any director or officer of, or person who controls such Underwriter) on account of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of the sale of any of the Senior Notes by such Underwriter to any person if it shall be established that a copy of the Prospectus, excluding any documents incorporated by reference (as supplemented or amended, if the Company shall have made any supplements or amendments which have been furnished to the Representatives), shall not have been sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Securities Act and the Company satisfied its obligations pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof, if the misstatement or omission leading to such loss, claim, damage or liability was corrected in the Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated by reference) as amended or supplemented, and such correction would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, or liability; and provided further, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, or in any preliminary Prospectus. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 9(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Senior Notes.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been
 
furnished), or any preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to either thereof, or any preliminary Prospectus. The indemnity agreement of the respective Underwriters contained in this Section 9(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Senior Notes.
 
(c) The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that, upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company, or against such Underwriter or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; provided that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any
 
proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
10. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Senior Notes which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, then the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions
Termination
 
which the principal amount of the Senior Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Senior Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so fail or refuse to purchase Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Senior Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter (except as provided in Section 6(g) and Section 9) or of the Company (except as provided in Section 6(b) and Section 9). In any such case not involving a termination, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
11. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Senior Notes.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
 
12. . The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company, the Underwriters and, with respect to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each controlling person and each officer and director of the Company and the Underwriters referred to in Section 9, and their respective successors, assigns, executors and administrators. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. The term "successors" as used in this Agreement shall not include any purchaser, as such, of any of the Senior Notes from any of the several Underwriters.
Miscellaneous
 
13. . All communications hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be mailed or delivered to the Representatives at the address set forth on Schedule II hereto, or if to the Company shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to it, attention of Treasurer, Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 (facsimile number: (804) 819-2211).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the arrangements for issuance by Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company) of up to U.S. $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2003 Series G 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2023 (the Senior Notes) and the offering of the Senior Notes by you pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated December 3, 2003 by and between you and the Company (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We have examined originals or copies certified to our satisfaction of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant
 
facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
 
In addition, we attended the closing held today at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement that are required to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Prospectus.
 
2. An appropriate order of the Commission with respect to the sale and performance of the Senior Notes under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been issued, and such order remains in effect at this date and constitutes valid and sufficient authorization for the sale and performance of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. No approval or consent by any public regulatory body, other than such order and notification of effectiveness by the Commission and approvals required under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations which have been obtained, is legally required in connection with the sale of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement (except to the extent that compliance with the provisions of securities or blue sky laws of certain states may be required in connection with the sale of the Senior Notes in such states) and the carrying out of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. The Senior Indenture dated as of June 1, 2000 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
5. The Senior Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when completed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture.
 
6. The Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Senior Notes has been duly authorized and validly reserved for issuance by the Company and, when issued upon
 
conversion of the Senior Notes in accordance with the terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is not subject to any preemptive rights.
 
7. The Registration Statement with respect to the Senior Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act, has become effective and remains in effect at this date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Senior Notes in the manner therein specified.
 
8. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except that we express no comment or belief with respect to any historical or pro forma financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
 
We have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes statistical statements in the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement. We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as it was initially issued and as it has been supplemented or amended, and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Underwriting Agreement. None of the foregoing participation, review or attendance disclosed to us any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued or the date it was supplemented or amended, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto, and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on said date or now omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus.
 
In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1)(8) above and in making the statements expressed in the preceding paragraph, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of up to U.S. $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2003 Series G 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Senior Notes) pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated December 3, 2003, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter
 
expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
 
On this basis we are of the opinion that:
 
1. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement or the due execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Senior Notes. An appropriate order of the Commission with respect to the sale and performance of the Senior Notes under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been issued, and such order remains in effect at this date and constitutes valid and sufficient authorization for the sale and performance of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
 
2. The Indenture has been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
3. The Senior Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when completed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
4. The Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Senior Notes has been duly authorized and validly reserved for issuance by the Company and, when issued upon conversion of the Senior Notes in accordance with the terms thereof, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is subject to any preemptive rights.
 
5. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-106790) with respect to the Senior Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act, has become effective and remains in effect at this date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of the Senior Notes in the manner therein specified.
 
6.The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
7. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Senior Notes contained in the prospectus initially filed as part of the Registration Statement under DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES, as supplemented by the statements under DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated December 3, 2003, are substantially accurate and fair.
 
8. With regard to the discussion in the prospectus supplement dated December 3, 2003, under the caption CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the Senior Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering the aforementioned tax opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions. There can be no assurance, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
 
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus were discussed, and we have consulted with officers and other employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. We have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which our investigation led us to deem pertinent. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement. We have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which our investigation did not lead us to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in the preceding paragraphs 7 and 8 in regard to the statements described in such preceding paragraphs. But such conferences, consultation, examination and attendance disclosed to us no information with respect to such other matters that
 
gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules and other financial information and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) contains on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such date or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is provided on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus prior to the date of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for you and the other several Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement dated December 3, 2003 (the with Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the under which you have severally agreed to purchase from the Company $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.125% Series G Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the ). The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Senior Indenture dated as of June 1, 2001 (the as supplemented by the Twenty-third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 1, 2003 (the and, together with the Senior Indenture, the between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known

"Senior Indenture"),
"Supplemental
Indenture"
"Indenture")
 
as the Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the and are convertible on the terms set forth in the Indenture into shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 7(a)(iii) of the Underwriting Agreement.
"Trustee"),
 
We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purposes of rendering this opinion.
 
We have participated in the preparation of the prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Securities, dated December 3, 2003 (the
"Prospectus Supplement").
 
Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Supplemental Indenture, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Company and the Trustee, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
2. Assuming that the Securities have been duly authorized by the Company, the Securities, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and equitable principles of general applicability, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
We have considered the statements relating to legal documents included in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Description of the Senior Notes" and in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Additional Terms of the Senior Debt Securities." In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize in all material respects such documents.
 
We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and our opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
 
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person (including any person that acquires the Securities from you) without our prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

To: The Addressees Listed on Annex A
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The arrangements for issuance of up to U.S. $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2003 Series G 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the Senior Notes), of Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated December 3, 2003, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement), have been taken under my supervision as Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
As Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, I have general responsibility over the attorneys within the Company's Legal Department responsible for rendering legal counsel to the Company regarding corporate, financial, securities and other matters. I am generally familiar with the organization, business and affairs of the Company. I am also familiar with the proceedings taken and proposed to be taken by the Company in connection with the offering and sale of the Senior Notes, and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of the law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, I have responsibility for supervising lawyers who may have been asked by me or others to review legal matters arising in connection with the offering and sale of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, some of the matters referred to herein have not been handled personally by me, but I have been made familiar with the facts and circumstances and the applicable law, and the opinions herein expressed are my own or are opinions of others in which I concur.
 
On this basis I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the respective laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' properties is subject other than any proceedings described in the Prospectus and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Prospectus.

(c) Payments of interest on the Series G Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be. Interest payments for the Series G Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any date on which interest is payable on the Series G Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. (d) Payment of the principal and interest on the Series G Senior Notes shall be made at the office of the Paying Agent in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, at the option of the Company, (i) 8
by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto. If any date on which principal and interest is payable on the Series G Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the principal and interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. SECTION 104. Denominations. The Series G Senior Notes may be issued in denominations of $1,000, or any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 105. Global Securities. The Series G Senior Notes will be issued initially in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Series G Senior Notes represented by such Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Series G Senior Notes in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. Owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Series G Senior Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or to a successor Depositary or its nominee or except as described below. The rights of Holders of such Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary. A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Series G Senior Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days of receipt by the Company of such notification, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days after it becomes aware of such cessation or (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series G Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct. SECTION 106. Optional Redemption. (a) On or after December 20, 2006, the Series G Senior Notes shall be redeemable, in whole or from time to time in part, at the option of the Company on any date (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to but excluding the Redemption Date (the "Redemption Price"). 9
(b) The Company shall notify each Holder of the redemption in the manner provided in Section 1104 of the Original Indenture. (c) If any Series G Senior Notes selected for partial redemption are thereafter surrendered for conversion in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Series G Senior Notes so selected, the converted portion of such Series G Senior Notes shall be deemed (so far as may be), solely for purposes of determining the aggregate principal amount of Series G Senior Notes to be redeemed by the Company, to be the portion selected for redemption. Series G Senior Notes which have been converted during a selection of Series G Senior Notes to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Nothing in this Section 106(c) shall affect the right of any Holder to convert any Series G Senior Notes before the termination of the conversion right with respect thereto. (d) In addition to those matters set forth in Section 1104 of the Indenture, a notice of redemption sent to the Holders of Series G Senior Notes shall state: (i) the name of the Paying Agent and Conversion Agent; (ii) the then current Conversion Rate; (iii) that the Series G Senior Notes called for redemption may be converted at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; and (iv) that Holders who wish to convert Series G Senior Notes must comply with the procedures in Section 110 of this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture and the fourth through ninth paragraphs of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes. (e) In the event of the redemption of the Series G Senior Notes in part only, a new Series G Senior Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the Holders thereof upon surrender thereof. SECTION 107. Purchase Upon a Fundamental Change. (a) If a Fundamental Change shall occur at any time prior to Stated Maturity, each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase any or all of such Holder's Series G Senior Notes for cash on the date designated by the Company that is no later than 30 days after the date of the Company Purchase Notice of the occurrence of such Fundamental Change (subject to extension if necessary to comply with applicable law, as provided in Section 109(g)) (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Date"). The Company shall purchase such Series G Senior Notes at a price (the "Fundamental Change Purchase Price") equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be purchased to but excluding the Fundamental Change Purchase Date. No Series G Senior Notes may be purchased at the option of the Holders due to a Fundamental Change if the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded. 10
(b) For a Series G Senior Note to be so purchased at the option of the Holder pursuant to this Section 107, the Paying Agent must receive: (i) a written notice of purchase (a "Fundamental Change Purchase Notice") substantially in the form entitled "Form of Fundamental Change Purchase Notice" on the reverse of the Series G Senior Note duly completed, on or before the close of business on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, subject to extension to comply with applicable law. The Fundamental Change Purchase Notice shall state: (1) if certificated, the certificate numbers of the Series G Senior Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased; (2) the portion of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and (3) that such Series G Senior Notes shall be purchased as of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Series G Senior Notes and in the Indenture; (ii) delivery or book-entry transfer of such Series G Senior Notes prior to, on or after the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent, such delivery or transfer being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Fundamental Change Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 107 only if the Series G Senior Notes so delivered or transferred to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related Fundamental Change Purchase Notice. SECTION 108. Purchase at the Option of the Holder. (a) On each of December 15, 2006, December 15, 2008, December 15, 2013 and December 15, 2018 (each, a "Put Date"), each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase any or all of such Holder's Series G Senior Notes for cash. The Company shall purchase such Series G Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be purchased to but excluding the Put Date. (b) For a Series G Senior Note to be so purchased at the option of the Holder, the Paying Agent must receive: (i) a written notice of purchase (a "Put Notice") substantially in the form entitled "Form of Put Notice" on the reverse of the Series G Senior Note duly completed, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 25 Business Days prior to a Put Date until the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to such Put Date. The Put Notice shall state: 11
(1) if certificated, the certificate numbers of the Series G Senior Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased; (2) the portion of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes which the Holder shall deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and (3) that such Series G Senior Notes shall be purchased as of the Put Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Series G Senior Notes and in the Indenture; and (ii) delivery or book-entry transfer of such Series G Senior Notes to the Paying Agent prior to, on or after the Put Date (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent, such delivery or transfer being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 108 only if the Series G Senior Notes so delivered or transferred to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related Put Notice. SECTION 109. Further Conditions and Procedures for Purchase. (a) The Company shall send notices (each, a "Company Purchase Notice") to the Holders (and to beneficial owners if required by applicable law) at their addresses shown in the Series G Senior Note register maintained by the Security Registrar, and shall deliver a copy of each such notice to the Trustee and Paying Agent, not less than 30 Business Days prior to each Put Date, or on or before the 30th day after the occurrence of the Fundamental Change, as the case may be (each such date of delivery, a "Company Purchase Notice Date"). Any such notice delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to a Fundamental Change shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying that a Fundamental Change has occurred and as to the date of the occurrence thereof, on which Certificate the Trustee and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely. Each Company Purchase Notice shall include a form of Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice to be completed by a Holder and shall state: (i) the applicable Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, the applicable Conversion Rate at the time of such notice (and any applicable adjustments to the Conversion Rate) and, to the extent known at the time of such notice, the amount of interest that will be payable with respect to the Series G Senior Notes on the applicable Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date; (ii) if the notice relates to a Fundamental Change, the events causing the Fundamental Change and the date of the Fundamental Change; (iii) the Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date; (iv) the last date on which a Holder may exercise its purchase right; (v) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; 12
(vi) that Series G Senior Notes must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect payment of the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price; (vii) that Series G Senior Notes as to which a Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been given by the Holder to the Company may be converted only if the applicable Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice has been withdrawn by the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture; provided that the Series G Senior Notes are otherwise convertible in accordance with the fourth through ninth paragraphs of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes; (viii) that the Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price for any Series G Senior Notes as to which a Put Notice or a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as applicable, has been given and not withdrawn shall be paid by the Paying Agent promptly following the later of the Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as applicable, or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of such Series G Senior Notes; (ix) the procedures the Holder must follow under Sections 107 or 108, as applicable, and Section 109; (x) briefly, the conversion rights of the Series G Senior Notes and whether, at the time of such notice, the Series G Senior Notes are eligible for conversion; (xi) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price on Series G Senior Notes covered by any Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as applicable, interest will cease to accrue on and after the Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as applicable; (xii) the CUSIP and, if applicable, the ISIN number of the Series G Senior Notes; and (xiii) the procedures for withdrawing a Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice. At the Company's request, made at least five Business Days prior to the date upon which such notice is to be mailed, and at the Company's expense, the Paying Agent shall give the Company Purchase Notice in the Company's name; provided, however, that, in all cases, the text of the Company Purchase Notice shall be prepared by the Company. (b) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Company from the Holder of the Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or the Put Notice specified in Section 107(b)(i) or Section 108(b)(i), as applicable, the Holder of the Series G Senior Notes in respect of which such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or the Put Notice, as the case may be, was given shall (unless such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or the Put Notice is withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Fundamental Change 13
Purchase Price or the Purchase Price with respect to such Series G Senior Notes. Such Fundamental Change Purchase Price or Purchase Price shall be paid by the Paying Agent to such Holder promptly following the later of (x) the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the Put Date, as the case may be, with respect to such Series G Senior Notes (provided the conditions in Section 107(b) or Section 108(b), as applicable, have been satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery or book-entry transfer of such Series G Senior Notes to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 107(b)(ii) or Section 108(b)(ii), as applicable. Series G Senior Notes in respect of which a Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or Put Notice, as the case may be, has been given by the Holder thereof may not be converted for shares of Common Stock on or after the date of the delivery of such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or Put Notice, as the case may be, unless such Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or Put Notice, as the case may be, has first been validly withdrawn or deemed to have been validly withdrawn as specified in Section 109(c) or (e); provided that the Series G Senior Notes are otherwise convertible in accordance with the fourth through ninth paragraphs of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes. On or before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the Put Date, as the case may be, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the aggregate Fundamental Change Purchase Price or the aggregate Purchase Price, as the case may be, of the Series G Senior Notes to be purchased pursuant to Section 107 or Section 108, as applicable. Payment by the Paying Agent of such Fundamental Change Purchase Price or Purchase Price for such Series G Senior Notes shall be made promptly following the later of the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the Put Date, as the case may be, or the time of book-entry transfer or delivery of such Series G Senior Notes. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, money sufficient to pay the Fundamental Change Purchase Price or Purchase Price, as the case may be, of such Series G Senior Notes on the Fundamental Change Purchase Date or the Put Date, as the case may be, then, on and after such date, such Series G Senior Notes shall cease to be Outstanding and interest (including any Contingent Interest) on such Series G Senior Notes shall cease to accrue, whether or not book-entry transfer of such Series G Senior Notes is made or such Series G Senior Notes are delivered to the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Fundamental Change Purchase Price or the Purchase Price, as the case may be, upon delivery or transfer of the Series G Senior Notes). Nothing herein shall preclude the Company's withholding any tax required by law. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of the Fundamental Change Purchase Price or the Purchase Price, as the case may be, and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to deliver all money held by it pursuant to this Section 109 to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. 14
All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any Series G Senior Notes for purchase shall be determined by the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding, absent manifest error. (c) A Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth Business Day prior to the Put Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, to which it relates specifying: (i) if certificated, the certificate number of the Series G Senior Notes in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; (ii) the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; and (iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Series G Senior Notes which remains subject to the Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, and which has been or shall be transferred or delivered for purchase by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof. (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 107 or 108 and this Section 109, if the Series G Senior Notes are represented by Global Securities in book-entry form the appropriate procedures of the Depositary must be complied with for any purchase upon a Fundamental Change or Put Option. (e) There shall be no purchase of any Series G Senior Notes pursuant to Section 107 or Section 108 if the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded. The Paying Agent shall promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Series G Senior Notes (x) with respect to which a Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been withdrawn in compliance with this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture, or (y) if the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded, in which case, upon such return, the Put Notice or Fundamental Change Purchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. (f) Any Series G Senior Notes that are to be purchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent, if any, shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Series G Senior Notes, without service charge, a new Series G Senior Note or Series G Senior Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes so surrendered which is not purchased. 15
(g) In connection with any offer to purchase Series G Senior Notes under Sections 107 or 108 hereof, the Company shall, to the extent applicable, (i) comply with Rules 13e-4 and 14e-1 (and any successor provisions thereto) under the Exchange Act, if applicable, (ii) file the related Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report) under the Exchange Act, if applicable and (iii) otherwise comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws so as to permit the rights and obligations under Sections 107, 108 or this Section 109 to be exercised in the manner specified in Sections 107, 108 or this Section 109; provided, however, that the Company shall not take any action in violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws. (h) The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company any cash or property that remains unclaimed as provided in Section 1003 of the Original Indenture, together with any unclaimed interest (including any Contingent Interest, if any), held by them for the payment of a Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be; provided, however, that to the extent that the aggregate amount of cash deposited by the Company pursuant to Section 109(b) exceeds the aggregate Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be, of the Series G Senior Notes or portions thereof which the Company is obligated to purchase as of the Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, then promptly on and after the Put Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be, the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess to the Company. (i) In any case where a Put Date or a Fundamental Change Purchase Date shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or the Series G Senior Notes) payment of interest and the Purchase Price or the Fundamental Change Purchase Price, as the case may be, need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date (provided that all other conditions therefor have been complied with), but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment (provided that such conditions have been complied with) with the same force and effect as if made on the Put Date or the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, as the case may be (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay). SECTION 110. Conversion of the Series G Senior Notes. (a) A Holder may convert its Series G Senior Notes for Common Stock at any time during the periods specified in the fourth paragraph of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes. (b) The initial Conversion Rate is 13.5865 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of a Series G Senior Note (the "Conversion Rate"), subject to adjustment as herein set forth. A Holder may convert a portion of the principal amount of Series G Senior Notes if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. (c) To convert Series G Senior Notes, the requirements set forth in this Section 110(c) and in the fourth through ninth paragraphs of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes must be satisfied. (i) To convert the Series G Senior Notes, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the Series G Senior Notes (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the 16
Conversion Agent at the office maintained by the Conversion Agent for such purpose, (2) with respect to Series G Senior Notes in certificated form, surrender the Notes to the Conversion Agent or with respect to Series G Senior Notes represented by Global Securities, cause the book-entry transfer thereof to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. The date on which the Holder satisfies all such requirements is the conversion date (the "Conversion Date"). As soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fifth Business Day following the Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to the Holder, through the Conversion Agent, a certificate (or credit the book-entry transfer of such shares of Common Stock) for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion and cash in lieu of any fractional share determined pursuant to Section 110(d). (ii) of Series G Senior Notes at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Series G Senior Notes at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Series G Senior Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest that the Holder is to receive on the Series G Senior Notes; provided, however, that no such payment need be made with respect to Series G Senior Notes in respect of which a Redemption Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date has been set that falls within this period or on such Interest Payment Date or to the extent any overdue interest (or Contingent Interest, if any) exists at the time of such conversion. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Series G Senior Notes. (iii) The Person in whose name the certificate for such shares of Common Stock is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; provided, however, that no surrender of Series G Senior Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Series G Senior Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Series G Senior Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Series G Senior Notes. (iv) No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on or other distributions with respect to any Common Stock except as provided in Section 110(g) or as otherwise provided in the Indenture. If a Holder converts more than one Series G Senior Note at the same time, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes converted. Upon surrender of a Series G Senior Note that is converted in part, the 17
Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Series G Senior Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Series G Senior Note surrendered. If the last day on which Series G Senior Notes may be converted is not a Business Day in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Series G Senior Notes may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day. A Holder of Series G Senior Notes is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such Holder has converted its Series G Senior Notes to Common Stock, and only to the extent such Series G Senior Notes are deemed to have been converted into Common Stock pursuant to this Section 110. (d) The Company shall not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of Series G Senior Notes. Instead the Company shall deliver cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share by multiplying the Last Reported Sale Price of a full share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date by the fractional amount and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. (e) If a Holder converts Series G Senior Notes, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which shall be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude the Company's withholding any tax required by law. (f) The Company shall, prior to issuance of any Series G Senior Notes hereunder, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of the Series G Senior Notes. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series G Senior Notes shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim. The Company shall endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the order and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Series G Senior Notes, if any, and shall cause to have listed or quoted all such shares of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if not listed thereon, on each United States national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted. Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series G Senior Notes shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of common stock or preferred stock purchase rights, as the case may be ("Rights"), if any, that shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights agreement adopted by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time (in each case, a "Rights Agreement"). (g) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows: 18
(i) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this Section 110(g)(i), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in treasury by the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 110(g)(i) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (ii) In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase at such below Current Market Price. For the purposes of this Section 110(g)(ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in treasury by the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. Such adjustment pursuant to this Section 110(g)(ii) shall be successively made whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, 19
options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price less than the average of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. (iii) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (iv) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash, property or assets (but excluding any rights, options or warrants referred to in Section 110(g)(ii) of this Section, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 110(g)(i)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 110(g)(iv) called the "Distributed Securities"), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) on such date of the portion of the Distributed Securities applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; provided that if the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Securities such holder would have received had such holder converted the Series G Senior Note on the date fixed for such determination. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the 20
Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 110(g)(iv) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price on the applicable date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this Section 110(g)(iv) is applicable, Sections 110(g)(i) and (ii) shall not be applicable. Rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 110(g) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 110(g) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 110(g)(iv). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the Original Issue Date, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 110(g) was made, (I) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (II) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such expired or terminated rights and warrants had not been issued. For purposes of this Section 110(g)(iv) and Section 110(g)(i) and Section 110(g)(ii), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 110(g)(iv) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (x) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other 21
than such shares of Common Stock or rights, options or warrants (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 110(g)(iv) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (y) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, options or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Sections 110(g)(i) and 110(g) (ii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 110(g)(i). (v) In case the Company shall make any dividend or distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding (I) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or (II) any quarterly cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock in any quarter does not exceed the dividend threshold amount ($0.645 initially being the "Dividend Threshold Amount" and such amount being subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate, provided that there shall be no adjustment to the Dividend Threshold Amount for adjustments to the Conversion Rate under this Section 110(g)(v))), then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted by multiplying the applicable Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Current Market Price minus the Dividend Threshold Amount and the denominator of which will be the Current Market Price minus the amount per share of such dividend or distribution, such adjustment to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; provided that if an adjustment is required to be made under this clause as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, the dividend threshold amount will be deemed to be zero; and provided further that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Series G Senior Note on the date fixed for such determination. (vi) If a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock expires and such tender or exchange offer (as amended up to the expiration thereof) requires the payment to tendering stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) that as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders or exchanges may be made under such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock for each of the 10 consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Expiration Time by a fraction, (I) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive 22
and described in a Board Resolution) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock for each of the 10 consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the Expiration Time, and (II) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the average of the Last Reported Sale Price of a share of Common Stock for each of the 10 consecutive Trading Days next succeeding the Expiration Time, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares under any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. (vii) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon an event to which Section 110(h)(iv) applies) shall be deemed to involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 110(g)(iv)), and (b) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of Section 110(g)(iii)). (viii) In the event that the Company makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock and the denominator shall be the Spin-off Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Spin-off Market Price per share or similar equity interest of the subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, such adjustment to become effective 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such distribution of capital stock of, or similar equity interest in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company; provided that if (x) the average of the Spin-Off Market Price of the Common Stock minus (y) the Spin-Off Market Price of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for 23
which this Section 110(g)(viii) applies is less than $1.00, then the adjustment provided by for by this Section 110(g)(viii) shall not be made and in lieu thereof the provisions of Section 110(g)(iv) shall apply to such distribution. In any case in which this Section 110(g) (viii) is applicable, Sections 110(g)(i), (ii) and (iv) shall not be applicable. (ix) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate, shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. (x) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 110(g)(ii) or (iv), no adjustment shall be made thereunder, nor shall an adjustment be made to the ability of a Holder of a Series G Senior Note to convert, for any distribution described therein if the Holder will otherwise participate in the distribution without conversion of such Holder's Series G Senior Notes. (xi) So long as each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series G Senior Notes is entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, that shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive in accordance with the terms of any Rights Agreement, there shall not be any adjustment to the Conversion Rate as a result of the issuance of Rights under a Rights Agreement; provided that an adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made in accordance with Section 110(g)(iv) if the Rights separate from the Common Stock. (xii) For purposes of this Section 110(g), "Fair Market Value" means the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. In the case of marketable equity securities, the Fair Market Value shall be determined based on the prevailing market price of such securities. (h) Conversion rate adjustments: (i) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made: (1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan; (2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (3) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not 24
described in (2) above and outstanding as of the date the Series G Senior Notes were first issued; (4) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or (5) for accrued and unpaid interest. To the extent the Series G Senior Notes become convertible into cash, assets or property (other than capital stock of the Company or securities to which Section 110(h)(iv) applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash, assets or property. Interest shall not accrue on such cash, assets or property. (ii) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice. The certificate shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof. (iii) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 110(g), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may from time to time increase the Conversion Rate by any amount if the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is so increased, the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice of such increase. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such notice except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof. The notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period it shall be in effect. (iv) If any of the following events occur, namely (a) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (b) any consolidation, merger or binding share exchange of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock or (c) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted. If any of the events described in the preceding sentence occur, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture or otherwise amend the terms of the Series G Senior Notes, to provide that each Series G Senior Note shall be convertible 25
into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or property or assets (including cash) that the Holder of the Series G Senior Note would have received upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance if such Holder had converted such Series G Senior Note into the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series G Senior Note immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance. Such supplemental indenture or other amendment to the Series G Senior Notes shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in Section 110(g). The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture or amendment of the Series G Senior Notes to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Series G Senior Note register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, binding share exchanges, sales and conveyances. If this Section 110(h)(iv) applies to any event or occurrence, Section 110(g) shall not apply. (v) The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to either calculate the Conversion Rate or determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed herein, or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same and shall be protected in relying upon an Officers' Certificate with respect to the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Series G Senior Notes and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Series G Senior Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 110. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 110(h)(iv) relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Series G Senior Notes after any event referred to in such Section 110(h)(iv) or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Article Six of the Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for determining whether any event contemplated by the fourth paragraph of the reverse of the Series G Senior Notes has occurred which makes the Series G Senior Notes eligible for 26
conversion or no longer eligible therefor until the Company has delivered to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate stating that such event has occurred, on which Certificate the Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely, and the Company agrees to deliver such Officers' Certificate to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent immediately after the occurrence of any such event. (vi) After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 110(g), any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under Section 110(g) shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. (vii) Whenever successive adjustments to the Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to Sections 110(g) or 110(h), such adjustments shall be made to the Current Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the intent of 110(g) or 110(h) and to avoid unjust or inequitable results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. (i) On conversion of a Series G Senior Note, that portion of accrued and unpaid interest on the converted Series G Senior Note attributable to the period from the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if no Interest Payment Date has occurred, from the Original Issue Date) through the Conversion Date and Tax Original Issue Discount accrued through the Conversion Date with respect to the converted Series G Senior Note shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Series G Senior Note being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for accrued and unpaid interest and Tax Original Issue Discount accrued through the Conversion Date and the balance, if any, of such fair market value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment), shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal amount of the Series G Senior Note being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. SECTION 111. Additional Events of Default. In addition to those matters set forth in Section 501 of the Original Indenture, an "Event of Default" with respect to the Series G Senior Notes shall also mean any of the following events: (i) default in the payment of any interest upon the Series G Senior Notes when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (ii) default in the payment of the principal of the Series G Senior Notes, at their Maturity, upon a redemption by the Company pursuant to Section 106, or pursuant to the Company's obligation to repurchase Series G Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 107 or upon the exercise by a holder of its option to require the Company to repurchase such holder's Series G Senior Notes pursuant to Section 108; (iii) default in the Company's obligation to convert the Series G Senior Notes upon exercise of a Holder's conversion right; or 27
(iv) failure to provide notice of a Fundamental Change on or before the 30/th/ day after the occurrence of such Fundamental Change. SECTION 112. Amendments; Waiver. In addition to those matters set forth in Section 902 of the Original Indenture, with respect to the Series G Senior Notes, no amendment or supplemental indenture shall without the consent of the Holder of each Series G Senior Note affected thereby: (i) reduce the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price of the Series G Senior Notes; or (ii) make any change that adversely affects the Holders' right to convert the Series G Senior Notes in accordance with their terms and Indenture. In addition, with respect to the Series G Senior Notes, to the extent set forth in Section 513 of the Original Indenture, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Series G Senior Notes may waive an existing default other than: (I) any default by the Company in any payment of the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Fundamental Change Purchase Price with respect to any Series G Senior Notes, or (II) any default which constitutes a failure to convert any Series G Senior Note in accordance with its terms and the Indenture. SECTION 113. Register of Securities; Paying Agent; Conversion Agent. Initially, the Trustee shall act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Security Registrar with respect to the Series G Senior Notes with the Place of Payment for the Series G Senior Notes initially being the Corporate Trust Office. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar or approve a change in the office through which any Paying Agent acts without notice, other than notice to the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Security Registrar or co-registrar. SECTION 114. Calculations. The Company will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Series G Senior Notes. These calculations include, but are not limited to, determination of the Trading Price, Current Market Price, Last Reported Sale Price, Spin-off Market Price, accrued interest payable (including any Contingent Interest) on the Series G Senior Notes and Conversion Rate of the Series G Senior Notes. The Company will make these calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, these calculations will be final and binding on the Holders. Promptly after the calculation thereof, the Company will provide to each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth a schedule of its calculations and each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent is entitled to conclusively rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without independent verification; provided, however, that in connection with the Company's obligation to pay Contingent Interest under Section 103(b) hereof, the Company shall determine whether Contingent Interest is payable with respect to an Interest Period and shall deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent no later than the first Business Day of each Interest Period with respect to which it has determined that Contingent Interest is payable an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination, setting forth the 28
calculations on which such determination is based and setting forth the amount of interest which will accrue on the Series G Senior Notes during such Interest Period. The Trustee and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely on such Officers' Certificate and may conclusively assume that no Contingent Interest is payable for any Interest Period for which they have not received such Officers' Certificate. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for making any calculation or determination referred to in this Section 114. The Trustee will forward the Company's calculations to any Holder upon the request of such Holder. SECTION 115. Tax Treatment. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of beneficial ownership interest in the Series G Senior Notes each beneficial holder of Series G Senior Notes will be deemed to have agreed, for United States federal income tax purposes (1) to treat the Series G Senior Notes as indebtedness that is subject to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1275-4 (the "Contingent Payment Regulations") and, for purposes of the Contingent Payment Regulations, to treat the fair market value of any stock beneficially received by a beneficial holder upon any conversion of the Series G Senior Notes as a contingent payment and (2) to be bound by the Company's determination of the "comparable yield" and "projected payment schedule," within the meaning of the Contingent Payment Regulations, with respect to the Series G Senior Notes. A Holder of Series G Senior Notes may obtain the issue price, the amount of original issue discount, issue date, yield to maturity, comparable yield and projected payment schedule for the Series G Senior Notes by submitting a written request for such information to the Company at the following address: Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219, Attention: Corporate Secretary. SECTION 116. Sinking Fund. The Series G Senior Notes shall not have a sinking fund. SECTION 117. Additional Interest. Any principal of and installment of interest on the Series G Senior Notes that is overdue shall bear interest at the rate of 2.125% (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. SECTION 118. Limitation on Liens. The Company will not, while any of the Series G Senior Notes remain Outstanding, create, or suffer to be created or to exist, any Lien upon any Principal Property of the Company or upon any shares of stock of any Material Subsidiary of the Company, whether such Principal Property is, or shares of stock are, now owned or hereafter acquired, to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company, unless it shall make effective provision whereby the Series G Senior Notes then Outstanding shall be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all indebtedness for borrowed money thereby secured so long as any such indebtedness shall be so secured; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the Company from creating, or from suffering to be created or to exist, any Liens, or any agreements, with respect to: (a) purchase money mortgages, or other purchase money liens, pledges, security interests or encumbrances of any kind upon property hereafter acquired by the Company, or Liens of any kind existing on any property or any shares of stock at the time of the acquisition 29
thereof (including Liens which exist on any property or any shares of stock of a Person which is consolidated with or merged with or into the Company or which transfers or leases all or substantially all of its properties to the Company), or conditional sales agreements or other title retention agreements and leases in the nature of title retention agreements with respect to any property hereafter acquired; provided, however, that no such Lien shall extend to or cover any other property of the Company; (b) Liens upon any property of the Company or any shares of stock of any Material Subsidiary of the Company existing as of the date of the initial issuance of the Series G Senior Notes or upon the shares of stock of any corporation, which Liens existed at the time such corporation became a Material Subsidiary of the Company; liens for taxes or assessments or other governmental charges or levies; pledges to secure other governmental charges or levies; pledges or deposits to secure obligations under worker's compensation laws, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation, including liens of judgments thereunder which are not currently dischargeable; pledges or deposits to secure performance in connection with bids, tenders, contracts (other than contracts for the payment of money) or leases to which the Company is a party; pledges or deposits to secure public or statutory obligations of the Company; builders', materialmen's, mechanics', carriers', warehousemen's, workers', repairmen's, operators', landlords' or other like liens in the ordinary course of business, or deposits to obtain the release of such liens; pledges or deposits to secure, or in lieu of, surety, stay, appeal, indemnity, customs, performance or return-of-money bonds; other pledges or deposits for similar purposes in the ordinary course of business; liens created by or resulting from any litigation or proceeding which at the time is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; liens incurred in connection with the issuance of bankers' acceptances and lines of credit, bankers' liens or rights of offset and any security given in the ordinary course of business to banks or others to secure any indebtedness payable on demand or maturing within 12 months of the date that such indebtedness is originally incurred; liens incurred in connection with repurchase, swap or other similar agreements (including, without limitation, commodity price, currency exchange and interest rate protection agreements); leases made, or existing on property acquired, in the ordinary course of business; liens securing industrial revenue or pollution control bonds; liens, pledges, security interests or other encumbrances on any property arising in connection with any defeasance, covenant defeasance or in-substance defeasance of indebtedness of the Company, including the Series G Senior Notes; liens created in connection with, and created to secure, a non-recourse obligation; zoning restrictions, easements, licenses, rights-of-way, restrictions on the use of property or minor irregularities in title thereto, which do not, in the opinion of the Company, materially impair the use of such property in the operation of the business of the Company or the value of such property for the purpose of such business; (c) Liens in favor of the United States (or any State), any foreign country or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of any such jurisdiction, to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any indebtedness incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of constructing or improving the property subject to such mortgages, including, without limitation, mortgages to secure indebtedness of the pollution control or industrial revenue bond type; 30
(d) indebtedness which may be issued by the Company in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Company or any Material Subsidiary of the Company with or into any other Person (which may be an Affiliate of the Company or any Material Subsidiary of the Company) in exchange for or otherwise in substitution for secured indebtedness of such Person ("Third Party Debt") which by its terms (i) is secured by a mortgage on all or a portion of the property of such Person, (ii) prohibits secured indebtedness from being incurred by such Person, unless the Third Party Debt shall be secured equally and ratably with such secured indebtedness or (iii) prohibits secured indebtedness from being incurred by such Person; (e) indebtedness of any Person which is required to be assumed by the Company in connection with a consolidation or merger of such Person, with respect to which any property of the Company is subjected to a Lien; (f) Liens of any kind upon any property acquired, constructed, developed or improved by the Company (whether alone or in association with others) after the date of the initial issuance of the Series G Senior Notes which are created prior to, at the time of, or within 18 months after such acquisition (or in the case of property constructed, developed or improved, after the completion of such construction, development or improvement and commencement of full commercial operation of such property, whichever is later) to secure or provide for the payment of any part of the purchase price or cost thereof; provided that in the case of such construction, development or improvement the Liens shall not apply to any property theretofore owned by the Company other than theretofore unimproved real property; (g) Liens in favor of the Company, one or more Material Subsidiaries of the Company, one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company or any of the foregoing in combination; (h) the replacement, extension or renewal (or successive replacements, extensions or renewals), as a whole or in part, of any Lien, or of any agreement, referred to above in clauses (1) through (7) inclusive, or the replacement, extension or renewal (not exceeding the principal amount of indebtedness secured thereby together with any premium, interest, fee or expense payable in connection with any such replacement, extension or renewal) of the indebtedness secured thereby; provided that such replacement, extension or renewal is limited to all or a part of the same property that secured the Lien replaced, extended or renewed (plus improvements thereon or additions or accessions thereto); or (i) any other Lien not excepted by the foregoing clauses (1) through (8); provided that immediately after the creation or assumption of such Lien, the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company secured by all Liens created or assumed under the provisions of this clause (9) shall not exceed an amount equal to 10% of the common shareholders' equity of the Company, as shown on its consolidated balance sheet for the accounting period occurring immediately prior to the creation or assumption of such Lien. This Section 118 has been included in this Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture expressly and solely for the benefit of the Series G Senior Notes and shall be subject to covenant defeasance pursuant to Section 402(3) of the Original Indenture. 31

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Series G Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the close of business on the Business Day preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, that with respect to Series G Senior Notes that are not represented by one or more Global Securities, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on the 15/th/ calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment Date.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed. Dated: DOMINION RESOURCES, INC. By:____________________________________ Name: Title: 5
REVERSE OF SERIES G SENIOR NOTE This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2000, as heretofore supplemented and amended and as further supplemented by a Twenty-Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 1, 2003 (collectively, as amended or supplemented from time to time, herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (the "Series G Senior Notes"), which is unlimited in aggregate principal amount. The Company shall pay Contingent Interest in cash to the Holders of the Securities of this series in respect of any six-month period from June 15 to December 14 and from December 15 to June 14, commencing with the six-month period beginning December 15, 2006, if the average Trading Price for each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities of this series for the Applicable Five Trading Day Period with respect to such Interest Period equals 120% or more of such principal amount of the Securities of this series. The amount of Contingent Interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of Securities of this series in respect of any Interest Period shall equal 0.25% of the average Trading Price for each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities of this series for the Applicable Five Day Trading Period with respect to such Interest Period. Contingent Interest, if any, will accrue from June 15 or December 15, as applicable, and will be payable in the same manner, at the same times and to the same Persons as ordinary interest. All payments of Contingent Interest shall be made in cash. Upon determination that Holders of the Securities of this series will be entitled to receive Contingent Interest during an Interest Period, as promptly as practicable after such determination, the Company shall provide notice thereof to the Holders of the Securities. Subject to the procedures set forth in the Indenture, a Holder may convert Securities of this series into Common Stock of the Company on or before the close of business on December 14, 2023 during the periods and upon satisfaction of at least one of the conditions set forth below: (a) in any calendar quarter after the quarter ended March 31, 2004 (and only during such calendar quarter) if the Last Reported Sale Price for the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days during the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the previous calendar quarter equals or exceeds 120% of the Conversion Price on such last Trading Day; (b) to the extent that the Company calls this Security or any portion thereof for redemption, in the case of such Security or portion thereof, at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; 6
(c) (1) if the Company elects to (A) distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 45 days after the date of such distribution, shares of Common Stock at less than the Last Reported Sale Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution or (B) distribute to all holders of Common Stock assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the Company, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Company's Board of Directors and set forth in a Board Resolution exceeding 5% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution. In the case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Company must notify the Holders of the Securities of this series at least 20 Business Days prior to the ex-dividend date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders of the Securities of this series may surrender such Securities for conversion at any time thereafter until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the ex-dividend date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder of the Securities of this series may not exercise the foregoing right to convert if the Holder may participate in the distribution without converting its Securities. As used herein, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution; or (2) in the event that the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or transfer of all or substantially all its assets pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities), at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until 15 days after the actual effective date of such transaction (or, if such consolidation, merger, share exchange or transfer of assets is a Fundamental Change, until the Fundamental Change Purchase Date); or (d) during any period that (1) the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Securities of this series by both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services are lower than Baa3 and BBB-, respectively; (2) both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services no longer rate the Securities of this series or have withdrawn their ratings with respect to the Securities of this series; or (3) either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services no longer rates the Securities of this series or has withdrawn or suspended such rating and the remaining rating is lower than Baa3 or BBB-, as applicable (references to Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services include any successors to those entities). Securities of this series in respect of which a Holder has delivered a notice of exercise of the option to require the Company to purchase such Securities of this series may be converted only if the notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial Conversion Rate is 13.5865 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Company shall deliver cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock. 7
Holders of Securities of this series at the close of business on a Regular Record Date will receive payment of interest payable on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion of such Securities of this series at any time after the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Securities of this series surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest that the Holder is to receive on the Securities of this series (except with respect to Securities of this series in respect of which a Redemption Date or Fundamental Change Purchase Date has been set that falls within this period or on such Interest Payment Date or to the extent any overdue interest (or Contingent Interest, if any) exists at the time of such conversion). Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Securities of this series. To convert the Securities of this series a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the irrevocable conversion notice on the back of the Securities of this series (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent at the office maintained by the Conversion Agent for such purpose, (2) surrender the Securities of this series to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. A Holder may convert a portion of the Securities of this series only if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment shall be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of Securities of this series, that portion of accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities attributable to the period from the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if no Interest Payment Date has occurred, from the Original Issue Date) through the Conversion Date and Tax Original Issue Discount accrued through the Conversion Date with respect to such converted Securities shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Common Stock (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for such Securities being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof, and the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for accrued and unpaid interest and Tax Original Issue Discount accrued through the Conversion Date and the balance, if any, of such fair market value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment), shall be treated as issued in exchange for the principal amount of such Securities being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof. If an Event of Default with respect to Series G Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Series G Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains 8
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Series G Senior Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Series G Senior Note and of any Series G Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Series G Senior Note. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Series G Senior Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Series G Senior Notes, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Series G Senior Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Series G Senior Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or premium, if any, or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series G Senior Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series G Senior Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Series G Senior Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Series G Senior Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series G Senior Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series G Senior Notes and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Company will be responsible for making all calculations called for under the Series G Senior Notes. These calculations include, but are not limited to, determination of the Trading Price, Current Market Price, Last Reported Sale Price, Spin-off Market Price, accrued interest payable (including any Contingent Interest) on the Series G Senior Notes and Conversion Rate. The Company will make these calculations in good faith and, absent manifest error, these calculations will be final and binding on the Holders of the Series G Senior Notes. Promptly after the calculation thereof, the Company will provide to each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth a schedule of its calculations and each of the Trustee and the Conversion Agent is entitled to rely upon the accuracy of such calculations without 9
independent verification. The Trustee will forward the Company's calculations to any Holder upon the request of such Holder. The Series G Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Series G Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series G Senior Notes having the same Stated Maturity and of like tenor of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder upon surrender of the Series G Senior Note or Series G Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Series G Senior Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Series G Senior Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of beneficial ownership interest in the Securities of this series each beneficial holder of such Securities will be deemed to have agreed, for United States federal income tax purposes (1) to treat the Securities of this series as indebtedness that is subject to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1275-4 (the "Contingent Payment Regulations") and, for purposes of the Contingent Payment Regulations, to treat the fair market value of any stock beneficially received by a beneficial holder upon any conversion of such Securities as a contingent payment and (2) to be bound by the Company's determination of the "comparable yield" and "projected payment schedule," within the meaning of the Contingent Payment Regulations, with respect to the Securities of this series. A Holder of Securities of this series may obtain the issue price, the amount of original issue discount, issue date, yield to maturity, comparable yield and projected payment schedule for such Securities by submitting a written request for such information to the Company at the following address: Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Company's issuance of $200 million principal amount of Series G Senior Notes, as described in the Company's prospectus supplement dated December 3, 2003 (the Prospectus Supplement"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this opinion have the meanings ascribed to them in the Prospectus Supplement.
 
In rendering this opinion, we have examined, and with your permission have relied on, the factual statements contained in the Prospectus Supplement and on such other instruments and documents, including records of the Company and certificates of public officials and authorized representatives of the Company, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed herein (collectively, the "Opinion Documents"). With your permission, we have not undertaken any independent investigation or verification of any factual matter set forth in the Opinion Documents, and we have assumed the factual statements set forth therein to be true, accurate and complete.
 
This opinion is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings and administrative pronouncements issued by the Internal Revenue Service, judicial decisions rendered by courts of competent jurisdiction, and such other authorities as we have considered relevant. These authorities are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and any such change may affect the continuing validity of the opinions set forth herein. This opinion will not be updated for subsequent changes or modifications to the law and regulations or to the judicial and administrative interpretations thereof unless we are specifically engaged to do so. Our opinion neither relates to nor purports to cover the laws, regulations, or other legal authorities of any state, local, or foreign governmental authority, nor any tax or other governmental charge, other than the United States federal income tax matters expressly herein addressed.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although such discussion does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Series G Senior Notes, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" is accurate in all material respects.
No ruling has or will be sought or obtained from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any of the matters on which we have opined. Moreover, this opinion is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts and as such does not provide a guarantee of result. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not take positions contrary to those stated herein or that a court would not uphold such contrary positions, potentially with adverse tax consequences.
 
We express no opinions other than those expressed in this opinion. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and to references to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933.
