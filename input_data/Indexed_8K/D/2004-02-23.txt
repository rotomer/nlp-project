Exhibit 99
[DOMINION LOGO]
 
RICHMOND, Va., - Dominion (NYSE: D) said today it will record an additional $44 million after-tax charge against its 2003 earnings prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to reflect the impaired value of its CNG International (CNGI) pipeline assets in Australia that are classified as held for sale.
The impairment represents adjustments to the assets' book value to reflect Dominion's current evaluation of the assets' fair market value, less estimated costs to sell.
Dominion quantified the impairment through the sales process which occurred after the company announced its preliminary unaudited 2003 earnings in January. At that time, Dominion announced net income for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2003, of $362 million ($1.14 per share). The additional after-tax impairment of $44 million (14 cents per share) now results in net income of $318 million ($1.00 per share). This revision will be reflected in Dominion's 2003 financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K.
The impairment, reported in the corporate segment, is excluded from operating earnings and does not affect Dominion's previously reported operating earnings
of $4.55 per share. A revised detailed description of the items included in 2003 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found at the end of this press release or by visiting our Web site at .
