Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On September 7, 2004, Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) entered into a forward sale agreement (the Forward Sale Agreement) with Merrill Lynch International ("MLI"), as forward purchaser, relating to 10,000,000 shares of Dominion's common stock. In connection with the Forward Sale Agreement, MLI borrowed an equal number of shares of Dominion's common stock from stock lenders (the Borrowed Shares) and, at Dominion's request, sold the Borrowed Shares at a price of $65.12 per share to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan") under a Purchase Agreement, dated September 7, 2004 (the Purchase Agreement), among Dominion, MLI and JPMorgan. JPMorgan is offering the Borrowed Shares to the public at a price of $65.20 per share.
 
Dominion will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of the Borrowed Shares. Dominion may elect to settle the Forward Sale Agreement by means of a physical stock, cash or net stock settlement. If Dominion elects to settle all of the shares subject to the Forward Sale Agreement with stock, it will receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $644 million, based on maturity forward prices of $64.62 per share for the 2,000,000 shares included in the first tranche and $64.34 per share for the 8,000,000 shares included in the second tranche. The first tranche must settle by December 20, 2004, and the second tranche must settle by May 17, 2005. Dominion may elect to settle all or part of either tranche earlier, at different settlement prices as provided in the Forward Sale Agreement.
 
Under certain circumstances, MLI may require Dominion to settle the Forward Sale Agreement on a date specified by it or by physical delivery of shares.
 
If Dominion elects to settle on a cash or net stock basis, the settlement amount will be equal to the agreed settlement price for the applicable tranche minus the average price of the shares (plus $.02 per share) purchased by MLI in order to close out its trading activities multiplied by the number of shares being settled. If the settlement amount is positive, MLI would, in the case of a cash settlement, pay that amount, or, in the case of a net stock settlement, deliver a number of shares to Dominion having a fair market value equal to that amount. If the settlement amount is negative, Dominion would, in the case of a cash settlement, pay the absolute value of that amount, or, in the case of a net stock settlement, deliver a number of shares to MLI having a fair market value equal to the absolute value of that amount.
 
JP Morgan has been granted an over-allotment option under the Purchase Agreement to purchase an additional 1,000,000 shares. The number of shares included in each tranche under the Forward Sale Agreement would be increased proportionately to cover any exercise of the over-allotment option.
 
Dominion may not be required to deliver more than 10,000,000 shares (subject to increase to 11,000,000 shares if the over-allotment option is exercised) under the Forward Sale Agreement.
 
The obligations of MLI under the Forward Sale Agreement are being guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.

As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement" and "Prospectus" include all documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) incorporated therein by reference, and shall include any documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) filed after the date of such Registration Statement or Prospectus and incorporated therein by reference from the date of filing of such incorporated documents (collectively, the Incorporated Documents).
 
(ii) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or otherwise preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act) and the rules, regulations and releases of the Commission (the Rules and Regulations); neither the Registration Statement on the date it was declared effective (the Effective Date) nor the Prospectus on the date hereof contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, on the Closing Date (as defined below), the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, that the foregoing representations and warranties in this Section 3(a)(ii) shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by you for use in the Registration Statement or Prospectus; and provided, further, that the foregoing representations and warranties are given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto.

5. . Delivery of the Firm Shares to, and payment therefor by, you shall be made at the time, place and date specified in Schedule I or such other time, place and date as you and the Company and MLI may agree upon in writing.

Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Purchase Agreement is a further condition of your obligation hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Shares shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Time and Place of Closing
 
At any time on or before the thirtieth day after the date of this Purchase Agreement, the option granted in Section 4 may be exercised by your written notice being given to the Company and to MLI. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised, the denominations in which the Option Shares are to be issued and the date and time, as determined by you, when the Option Shares are to be delivered; provided, however, that this date and time shall not be earlier than the First Closing Date nor earlier than the fourth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised.

Conditions of the Obligations of the Company and MLI
 
9. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless MLI and you, and each person who controls MLI or you within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which MLI, you or any of such persons may
Indemnification and Contribution
become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse MLI, you and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), or any preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that the foregoing indemnity agreement, insofar as it relates to any preliminary Prospectus, shall not inure to your benefit (or to the benefit of any person who controls you) on account of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of your sale of any of the Borrowed Shares to any person if it shall be established that a copy of the Prospectus, excluding any documents incorporated by reference (as supplemented or amended, if the Company shall have made any supplements or amendments which have been furnished to you), shall not have been sent or given by you or on your behalf to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Securities Act and the Company satisfied its obligations pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof, if the misstatement or omission leading to such loss, claim, damage or liability was corrected in the Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated by reference) as amended or supplemented, and such correction would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, or liability; and provided further, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by you or on your behalf for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, or in any preliminary Prospectus. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 9(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by you or on your behalf or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Borrowed Shares.
 
(b) You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and MLI, its officers and directors, and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any
amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), or any preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by you or on your behalf for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to either thereof, or any preliminary Prospectus. Your indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Borrowed Shares.
 
(c) The Company, MLI and you agree that, upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company, or against MLI or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling MLI as aforesaid, or against you or any person controlling you as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; provided that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and MLI, on the one hand, and of you, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company or MLI, on the one hand, or by you, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, MLI and you agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

11. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Purchase Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company or duly authorized representatives of MLI submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by you or on your behalf or any of your controlling persons, or by or on behalf of the Company, or by or on behalf of MLI, and shall survive delivery of the Borrowed Shares.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the arrangements for the borrowing and sale by Merrill Lynch International (MLI), at the request of Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), of 10,000,000 shares (the Borrowed Shares), of the Company's common stock (no par value) pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated September 7, 2004, between the Company, MLI and you (the Purchase Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
 
In addition, we attended the closing held today at the offices of McGuireWoods LLP, One James Center, Richmond, Virginia, at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement that are required to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Prospectus.
 
2. No approval or consent by any public regulatory body, other than such order and notification of effectiveness by the Commission and approvals under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, all of which have been obtained, is legally required in connection with the sale of the Borrowed Shares as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (except to the extent that compliance with the provisions of securities or blue sky laws of certain states may be required in connection with the sale of the Borrowed Shares in such states) and the carrying out of the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.
 
3. The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
 
4. The Borrowed Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
5. The Registration Statement with respect to the Borrowed Shares filed pursuant to the Securities Act has become effective and remains in effect at this date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale and the sale of the Borrowed Shares in the manner therein specified.
 
6. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except that we express no comment or belief with respect to any historical or pro forma financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
7. The statements relating to the Borrowed Shares contained in the prospectus initially filed as part of the Registration Statement under the caption DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCKCommon Stock are accurate and do not omit any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such statements not misleading.
 
 
We have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes
 
statistical statements in the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated in the preceding paragraph in regard to the statements relating to the Borrowed Shares under the captions set forth in such preceding paragraph. We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as it was initially issued and as has been supplemented or amended, and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement. None of the foregoing participation, review or attendance disclosed to us any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued or the date it was supplemented or amended, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated therein by reference and any pro forma financial information and notes thereto included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on said dates or now omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement.
 
In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1)  (7) above and in making the statements expressed in the preceding paragraph, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the letter agreement dated September 7, 2004 (the Forward Agreement) between the Company and Merrill Lynch International (MLI) relating to the forward sale by the Company of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock (no par value) (the Common Stock) and in connection with the borrowing and sale by MLI, at the request of the Company, to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (JPMorgan) of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, pursuant to a purchase agreement dated September 7, 2004, among the Company, MLI and JPMorgan (the Purchase Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(a)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement or the Forward Agreement.
 
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to
 
various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement have been satisfactory to us. With respect to opinions relating to the Settlement Shares, we have assumed the continuing accuracy of representations and warranties relating to the Settlement Shares made by the Company and MLI in the Purchase Agreement and the Forward Agreement and the compliance by the Company and MLI with all covenants relating to the Settlement Shares contained in the Purchase Agreement and the Forward Agreement.
 
On this basis we are of the opinion that:
 
1. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and the Forward Agreement by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Borrowed Shares or the Settlement Shares. An appropriate order of the Commission with respect to the sale of the Settlement Shares under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been issued, and such order remains in effect at this date and constitutes valid and sufficient authorization for the sale of the Settlement Shares as contemplated by the Forward Agreement.
 
2. The Borrowed Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
3. The Settlement Shares to be purchased by MLI from the Company pursuant to the Forward Agreement, whether pursuant to physical settlement, net stock settlement, as a result of acceleration of the Forward Agreement or otherwise, have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance and, when issued and delivered by the Company to MLI pursuant to the Forward Agreement against payment for consideration as set forth in the Forward Agreement, will be validly issued and fully-paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of the Settlement Shares is not subject to any preemptive or similar right.
 
4. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-106790) with respect to the Borrowed Shares filed pursuant to the Securities Act has become effective and remains in effect at this date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale and the sale of the Borrowed Shares in the manner therein specified.
 
5. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus (except the financial statements, pro forma financial information and schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
6. The statements relating to the Borrowed Shares contained in the prospectus initially filed as part of the Registration Statement under DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCKCommon Stock are substantially accurate and fair.
 
7. The Forward Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
8. In reliance upon the SEC Staff Interpretation of Section 5 of the Securities Act set forth in the no-action letter captioned Goldman, Sachs & Co. (available October 9, 2003), the issuance and sale of the Settlement Shares by the Company to MLI in settlement of the Forward Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof will not require registration under the Securities Act, and MLI will not have an obligation to deliver a prospectus in connection with the shares delivered to it by the Company upon such settlement, assuming that (i) Prospectuses were delivered by JPMorgan in connection with sales of Borrowed Shares in an amount greater than or equal to the number of Settlement Shares, and (ii) MLI only delivers the Settlement Shares to close out open borrowings created in the course of the hedging activities by MLI relating to its exposure under the Forward Agreement in compliance with the Forward Agreement.
 
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus were discussed, and we have consulted with officers and other employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. We have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which our investigation led us to deem pertinent. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement. We have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which our investigation did not lead us to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in paragraph 6 in regard to the statements described under the captions set forth in paragraph 6. But such conferences, consultation, examination and attendance disclosed to us no information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on the date the Registration Statement became effective, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the
 
Registration Statement or Prospectus) contains on the date hereof, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such dates or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is provided on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement or Prospectus prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement.
 
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
 
Yours very truly,
 
MCGUIREWOODS LLP
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The arrangements for the borrowing and sale of up to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the Borrowed Shares), of Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company), by Merrill Lynch International (MLI) to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (JPMorgan), pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated September 7, 2004, by and among the Company, MLI and JPMorgan (the Purchase Agreement), in connection with the letter agreement dated September 7, 2004, (the Forward Agreement) between the Company and MLI, relating to the forward sale by the Company of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock (no par value), have been taken under my supervision as Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.
 
As Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, I have general responsibility over the attorneys within the Company's Legal Department responsible for rendering legal counsel to the Company regarding corporate, financial, securities, and other matters. I am generally familiar with the organization, business and affairs of the Company. I am also familiar with the proceedings taken and proposed to be taken by the Company in connection with the offering and sale of the Borrowed Shares and the issuance and sale of the Settlement Shares, and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of the law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, I have responsibility for supervising lawyers who may have been asked by me or others to review legal matters arising in connection with the offering and sale of the Borrowed Shares and the issuance and sale of the Settlement Shares. Accordingly, some of the
 
matters referred to herein have not been handled personally by me, but I have been made familiar with the facts and circumstances and the applicable law, and the opinions herein expressed are my own or are opinions of others in which I concur.
 
On this basis I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and the Forward Agreement; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the respective laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
3. The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
4. The Forward Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
5. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' properties is subject other than any proceedings described in the Prospectus and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Purchase Agreement or the Forward Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Prospectus.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Virginia and I do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without my prior written consent. I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein resulting from matters that may hereinafter arise or that may hereinafter be brought to my attention.
 
Yours very truly,

In case of the failure of ML punctually to make any such payment, ML & Co. hereby agrees to make such payment, or cause such payment to be made, promptly upon demand made by the Company to ML & Co.; provided, however that delay by the Company in giving such demand shall in no event affect ML & Co.'s obligations under this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect or shall be reinstated (as the case may be) if at any time any payment guaranteed hereunder, in whole or in part, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Company upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of ML or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
ML & Co. hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Agreement; the absence of any action to enforce the same; any waiver or consent by the Company concerning any provisions thereof; the rendering of any judgment against ML or any action to enforce the same; or any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or a defense of a guarantor. ML & Co. covenants that this guarantee will not be discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the Agreement. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective if ML merges or consolidates with or into another entity, loses its separate legal identity or ceases to exist.
 
ML & Co. hereby waives diligence; presentment; protest; notice of protest, acceleration, and dishonor; filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of ML; all demands whatsoever, except as noted in the first paragraph hereof; and any right to require a proceeding first against ML.

This Guarantee may be terminated at any time by notice by ML & Co. to the Company given in accordance with the notice provisions of the Agreement, effective upon receipt of such
notice by the Company or such later date as may be specified in such notice; provided, however, that this Guarantee shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any obligation of ML under the Agreement entered into prior to the effectiveness of such notice of termination.
