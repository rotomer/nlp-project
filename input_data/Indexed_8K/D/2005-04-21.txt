Exhibit 99
 
RICHMOND, Va. - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today preliminary unaudited earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2005 of $1.25 per share.
Dominion also announced today preliminary operating earnings of $1.44 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2005. Operating earnings are defined as earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP adjusted for certain items. This preliminary result falls in the upper end of the company's first quarter operating earnings guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the board of directors and for the company's annual incentive plan. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.
The following charges, all shown on an after-tax basis, are included in first quarter 2005 GAAP earnings, but are excluded from operating earnings: 13 cents per share related to the acquisition of the Panda non-utility generation facility that occurred in the first quarter and 6 cents per share of charges related to exiting certain activities. A detailed reconciliation of operating earnings to GAAP earnings will be provided with Dominion's May 4 earnings release.
 
Millstone Unit #3 Outage Not Expected to Affect Annual Guidance
An unplanned outage that began last Sunday at Unit 3 of Dominion's Millstone Nuclear Station is not expected to affect the company's full-year earnings guidance. In the normal course of planning and budgeting, management includes estimates of unplanned outage time at its nuclear facilities. Current expectations for Unit 3's resumption of service, and replacement power costs for the outage, fall well within budgeted annual estimates.
