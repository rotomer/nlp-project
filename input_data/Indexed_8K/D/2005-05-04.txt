Company reaffirms 2005 earnings guidance
Conference call scheduled for 10 a.m. EDT today
RICHMOND, Va. - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2005, of $429 million ($1.25 per share) compared to net income of $437 million ($1.34 per share) for the same period last year.
Operating earnings, which are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items, were $492 million ($1.44 per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2005, compared to operating earnings of $448 million ($1.37 per share) for the same period in 2004.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the board of directors and for the company's annual incentive plan. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2005 and 2004 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thos. E. Capps, chairman and chief executive officer, said:
"The first quarter was the latest witness to the strength in diversity of our assets. We were able to absorb the impact of some production delays with improved performance in other areas. We are pleased to have delivered operating earnings in the upper end of our guidance and reaffirm full-year operating earnings guidance of $5.00 to $5.10 per share as we continue our focus on delivering on 2005 expectations one quarter at a time."
In providing operating earnings guidance, Dominion management is not aware of differences between expected 2005 operating earnings and GAAP earnings beyond those recorded in the first quarter. The corresponding GAAP equivalent for 2005 earnings per share guidance is $4.81 to $4.91 per share.
 
First-quarter 2005 operating earnings compared to guidance
Dominion's operating earnings of $1.44 per share came in near the top of the company's operating earnings guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share. Key drivers were the earlier-than-planned closing on the Dominion New England asset acquisition; the positive effect of establishing regulatory assets in connection with the North Carolina rate case settlement; higher contributions from the company's Producer Services business; higher-than-expected sales in our franchise service areas due to cooler-than-normal weather, and the benefit of higher-than-forecasted oil prices at Dominion Exploration & Production (E&P). These positive effects were partially offset by production delays in the Gulf of Mexico and the resulting impact from the discontinuance of hedge accounting on the delayed volumes; higher-than-planned unrecoverable fuel expenses at Dominion Virginia Power; and the write-off of certain start-up and integration costs associated with joining the PJM regio nal transmission organization.
Complete details of first-quarter 2005 results compared to company guidance can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
 
First-quarter 2005 operating earnings compared to 2004
First-quarter 2005 operating earnings of $1.44 per share compares to $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Dominion New England; higher natural gas and oil prices at E&P; higher contributions from the company's Producer Services business as well as Dominion Retail; the favorable impact of the North Carolina rate case settlement; and lower purchased-power capacity expenses. These positives were partially offset by higher expenses at E&P, primarily due to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for certain oil hedges, including subsequent changes in fair value of those hedges; and an increase in
unrecoverable fuel expenses at Dominion Virginia Power
.
Complete details of first-quarter 2005 operating earnings compared to 2004 can be found on Schedule 5 of this release.
 
Second-quarter 2005 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects second-quarter 2005 operating earnings in the range of 73 cents to 85 cents per share. This compares to 81 cents per share in the second quarter of 2004. Drivers that compare favorably to 2004 include contributions from Dominion New England; higher commodity prices at E&P; higher margins from the company's Producer Services business; customer growth; and the effect of the second-quarter 2004 write-off of Virginia fuel expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2004 that had been deferred. Expected offsets include a return to normal weather; the effects of favorable second-quarter 2004 items at E&P not expected to recur in the second quarter of 2005, such as gains on oil options and a positive tax adjustment; higher expenses at E&P; and the effect of an unplanned outage at the Millstone power station.
In providing second-quarter 2005 operating earnings guidance, Dominion management is not aware of differences between operating earnings and GAAP earnings. Therefore the corresponding GAAP equivalent for second-quarter 2005 earnings per share guidance also is 73 cents to 85 cents per share.
Complete details of Dominion's second-quarter 2005 guidance can be found on the company's Web site at .
