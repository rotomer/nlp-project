(b) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect.

reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Loan Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permissible under applicable law.

The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permitted by applicable law.
 
3.8.
Sharing of Payments.
 
Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or L/C Obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its pro rata share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation in Loans made to the Borrower may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

Evidence of Debt.
 
(a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by or for the account of the Borrower from time to time under this Credit Agreement.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 12.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
 
(c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.9 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; , , that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, the Register or such subaccounts, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender to the Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof.

In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any request by the Borrower for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, and (B) any request by the Borrower for conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for conversion into or continuation of Base Rate Loans.

(A) declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender to the Borrower hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
 
(B) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it to the Borrower be converted to Base Rate Loans in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans.
 
(ii) In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (A) or (B) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender to the Borrower or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to the Borrower shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans made by such Lender to the Borrower in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.
 
(c) . If at any time a Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to the making, the commitment to make or the maintaining of any Eurodollar Loan because of (i) any change since the date of this Credit Agreement in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or such order) including, without limitation, the imposition, modification or deemed applicability of any reserves, deposits or similar requirements (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or (ii) other circumstances affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market; then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender promptly upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender may determine in its sole discretion) as may be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder.

Each determination and calculation made by a Lender under this Section 4.1 shall, absent manifest error, be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

Capital Adequacy.
 
If, after the date hereof, any Lender has determined that the adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its parent corporation) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's (or parent corporation's) capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to the Borrower to a level below that which such Lender (or its parent corporation) could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's (or parent corporation's) policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its parent corporation) for such reduction.

(b) if any repayment, continuation or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan by the Borrower occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, including, without limitation, in connection with any demand, acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise (including any demand under this Section 4); or
 
(c) if the Borrower fails to repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Credit Agreement.
 
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 4.3 shall be made as though the Lender has actually funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America; , , that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 4.3.

charge is made or entered on the books of such Lender subsequent thereto.
