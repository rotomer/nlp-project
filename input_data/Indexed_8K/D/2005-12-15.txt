Dear Tom,
After 34 years on the Boards of either Virginia Electric and Power Company or Dominion, I will retire December 31, 2005. My last Board meeting will be December 16, 2005.
My affiliation with Dominion has been educational and enlightening. Thank you for your leadership. I hope that you and Sandy will stay in touch.
