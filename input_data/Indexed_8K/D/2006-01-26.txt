Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: January 26, 2006

 
RICHMOND, Va. - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2005, of $1.03 billion ($3.00 per share) compared to net income of $1.25 billion ($3.78 per share) for the same period last year.
Operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2005, were $1.56 billion ($4.53 per share) compared to operating earnings of $1.52 billion ($4.61 per share) for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2004. Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Operating earnings in 2005 exceeded earnings guidance provided Nov. 3 of $4.11 to $4.21 per share largely due to earlier-than-expected resumption of storm-delayed natural gas and oil production at the company's offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Also contributing favorably to operating earnings was a non-cash, mark-to-market benefit from hedges de-designated following the storms. These benefits were partially offset by lower-than-expected gas and oil price realization, primarily due to increased locational basis differentials.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the board of directors and for the companys annual incentive plan. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
 
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2005 and 2004 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Tom Farrell, president and chief executive officer, said:
Our 2005 results reflect the ingenuity and diligence of our employees, particularly our E&P team. By finding unconventional ways to deliver offshore gas and oil production to market following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we were able to overcome obstacles and deliver 2005 earnings above post-hurricane expectations. This also benefits Dominions cash flow and reduces our potential business interruption insurance claims.
The structural factors that will drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2007, 2008 and 2009 remain in place. Because of this, our Board of Directors demonstrated its confidence in our outlook by declaring a 2-cents per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend. This results in an annual dividend rate of $2.76 per share or a 3-percent increase over 2005.
Fourth-quarter earnings
Dominion also announced today unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2005, of $257 million (74 cents per share) compared to net income of $224 million (67 cents per share) for the same period last year.
Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2005, were $353 million ($1.02 per share) compared to operating earnings of $408 million ($1.22 per share) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2004.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2005 and 2004 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Fourth-quarter 2005 operating earnings compared to guidance
Dominions fourth-quarter 2005 actual operating earnings of $1.02 per share compares to fourth-quarter
operating earnings guidance of 60 to 70 cents per share provided on Nov. 3. The earlier-than-expected resumption of approximately 23 Bcfe of natural gas and oil production resulted in a 38-cents per share benefit in the quarter. In addition, 2005 operating earnings include a 23-cents per share non-cash mark-to-market benefit from de-designated hedges. The mark-to-market benefit is due to lower 2006 gas and oil prices as of Dec. 31 as compared to prices on Sept. 30. These positives were partially offset by 17 cents per share due to lower natural gas prices and increased locational basis differentials, net of basis hedges. Items detailed above also explain the difference between Dominions full-year 2005 actual operating earnings of $4.53 per
 
share as compared to operating earnings guidance of $4.11 to $4.21 per share updated on Nov. 3.
Complete details of fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 results versus guidance can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
 
2005 operating earnings compared to 2004
Fourth-quarter 2005 operating earnings of $1.02 per share compares to operating earnings of $1.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease is primarily attributable to hurricane-related delays in gas and oil production, business interruption insurance proceeds recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 but not in the fourth quarter of 2005, and higher Virginia fuel expenses. These negatives were partially offset by higher realized gas and oil prices and a non-cash, mark-to-market benefit from hedges de-designated following the hurricanes.
Full-year 2005 operating earnings of $4.53 per share compares to operating earnings of $4.61 per share in 2004. The decrease is primarily attributable to hurricane-related delays in gas and oil production, higher Virginia fuel expenses, and the effect of gains on oil options in 2004 that did not recur in 2005. These negatives were partially offset by higher realized gas and oil prices, higher contributions from the companys merchant generation and producer services businesses, and gains on the sale of excess emissions allowances.
Complete details of 2005 operating earnings compared to 2004 can be found on Schedule 5 of this release.
2006 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects 2006 operating earnings in the range of $5.05 to $5.25 per share. This compares to the companys previous operating earnings guidance of $5.00 to $5.25 per share provided on May 4, 2005. An expected benefit from higher commodity prices is the primary earnings driver that compares favorably to original guidance. Drivers expected to offset the benefit of higher prices include the negative effect of increased locational basis differentials, lower gas and oil production, increased business interruption insurance policy premiums and higher pension and benefits expenses.
In providing operating earnings guidance, there could be differences between expected GAAP and operating earnings, for matters such as, but not limited to, changes in accounting principles. At this time Dominion is aware of potential differences related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment
, but is not at this time able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for 2006 earnings per share guidance.
