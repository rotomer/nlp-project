(i) By approximately 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) on such Remarketing Date, (A) the Remarketing Agent shall advise by telephone the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary, the Depositary and the Trustee of the Reset Rate determined in the Remarketing, (B) the Remarketing Agent shall advise each purchaser of Senior Notes sold in the Remarketing or such purchaser's DTC participant (the "Depositary Participant") of the Reset Rate and the number of Senior Notes such purchaser is to purchase, and (C) the Remarketing Agent shall request each purchaser to give instructions to its Depositary Participant to pay the purchase price on the third Business Day after the Remarketing Date (the "Remarketing Settlement Date") in same day funds against delivery of the Remarketing Senior Notes purchased through the facilities of the Depositary.
 
In accordance with the Depositary's normal procedures, on the Remarketing Settlement Date or the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, as applicable, the transactions described above with respect to Senior Notes remarketed in the Remarketing shall be executed through the Depositary, and the accounts of the respective Depositary Participants shall be debited and credited, respectively, and such Remarketing Senior Notes delivered by book-entry, as necessary to effect purchases and sales of such Remarketing Senior Notes; provided, however, that, the settlement procedures set forth herein, including provisions for payment by purchasers of the Remarketing Senior Notes in the Remarketing, shall be subject to modification to the extent required by the Depositary or if the book-entry system is no longer available for the Remarketing Senior Notes at the time of the Remarketing, to facilitate the remarketing of the Remarketing Senior Notes in certificated form and the Remarketing Agent may modify such settlement procedures in order to facilitate the settlement process.
 
(ii) Upon receipt of the proceeds from a Successful Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall:
 
(A) deduct and retain for itself an amount equal to 0.25% of the Principal Amount of the Remarketing Senior Notes as a fee for the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder;

(C) if any Separated Senior Notes were included in such Successful Remarketing, remit to the Collateral Agent for payment to the holders of such Separated Senior Notes the amounts specified in clauses 1(ii) and 2(ii) of the definition of Remarketing Value; and
 
(D) remit any remaining balance of such proceeds after the application of such proceeds as set forth in clauses (A) through (C) above, if any, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and to the Collateral Agent for the holders of any remarketed Separated Senior Notes, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that if such Successful Remarketing is consummated after 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) on such Remarketing Date and, despite using its commercially reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot cause the applications of the proceeds specified above to occur on the Remarketing Settlement Date, then the Remarketing Agent may make such applications and remittances on the next succeeding Business Day.
 
The Remarketing Agent may, in its discretion, communicate with holders of the Senior Notes, and prospective purchasers of Remarketing Senior Notes in connection with its remarketing efforts in order to facilitate the remarketing and the intent and purpose of this Agreement despite the fact that such communication may not be expressly required herein.

If a Failed Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent and the Company, as applicable, shall take the following actions:
 
(i) The Remarketing Agent shall notify by telephone the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Trustee that a Failed Remarketing has occurred, whereupon the Company shall notify the Depositary, by telephone, that a Failed Remarketing has occurred.

(h) If there are no Pledged Senior Notes and no holders of Separated Senior Notes elect to participate in the Remarketing and deliver their Separated Senior Notes and a notice of such election to the Collateral Agent by the Election Date in accordance with the Supplemental Indenture, then:
 
(i) the Remarketing Agent shall, in its sole discretion, determine the rate that, in its judgment, would have been established had a Remarketing been held on the Final Remarketing Date, and such rate shall be the Reset Rate;
 
(ii) the Remarketing Agent shall advise by telephone the Company and the Trustee of such Reset Rate, whereupon the Company shall notify the Depositary in writing of such Reset Rate; and

(f) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request to qualify any of the Remarketing Senior Notes for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as the Remarketing Agent may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Senior Notes; that in connection therewith, the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to submit to any requirements which it deems unduly burdensome.

Section 7.
Conditions to the Remarketing Agent's Obligations.
 
The obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder are subject to (i) the accuracy, on and as of the date when made, of the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein or in any Certificates of any officer of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and (iii) each of the following additional terms and conditions:

(b) The Remarketing Agent shall not have discovered and disclosed to the Company on or prior to the Remarketing Date that the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto contains any untrue statement of a fact which, in the opinion of counsel to the Remarketing Agent, is material or omits to state any fact which, in the opinion of such counsel, is material and is required to be stated therein or is necessary to make the statements therein not misleading unless the Company shall have filed an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or otherwise acted to correct the matter so disclosed.
 
(c) Both counsel to the Company and counsel to the Remarketing Agent shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent their written opinions, addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated the Initial Remarketing Date and, if applicable, any Subsequent Remarketing Date and the Final Remarketing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent, to the effect that:
 
(i) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, which have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states), is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture, the Senior Notes and this Agreement by the Company or for the Remarketing of the Senior Notes.
 
(ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of, the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
 
(iii) The Senior Notes have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
 
(iv) The Remarketing Senior Notes and the Remarketing Agreement, when the Remarketing Senior Notes are remarketed pursuant to this Agreement, will conform to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus and in the Time of Sale Information, and the Indenture is in substantially the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
 
(v) The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the Remarketing Date and the Indenture was qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations specified in such opinion; and, to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose is pending or threatened by the Commission.
 
(vi) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that such counsel need express no comment or belief with respect to the financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus).
 
(vii) The statements contained in the Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES as supplemented by the statement under DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement, insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein, constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all material respects.
 
(viii) Based upon current law and the assumptions stated or referred to therein, the statements relating to the Remarketing Senior Notes set forth in the Prospectus or in the Time of Sale Information under UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, insofar as they purport to
 
constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that its opinion is limited to matters governed by the Federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of New York. Such counsel shall also advise the Remarketing Agent that although such counsel is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility or liability for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Remarketing Date, they have no reason to believe that any of such documents (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when such documents became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Securities Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading. Such counsel shall also advise the Remarketing Agent that although such counsel is not passing upon and, except as set forth in clauses (vii) and (viii) above, assumes no responsibility or liability for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to such date, such counsel has no reason to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such date (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, at the Time of Sale, the Time of Sale Information contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Remarketing Date (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Commencement Date, the Remarketing Date and the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, either the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Remarketing Date (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such
 
counsel may state that its opinion is given on the basis that any statement contained in an Incorporated Document shall be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
 
(d) The General Counsel of the Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent a written opinion, addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated the Initial Remarketing Date and, if applicable, any Subsequent Remarketing Date and the Final Remarketing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent, to the effect that:
 
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(ii) Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has the power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(iii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
(iv) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, other than (A) as described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and (B) actions, suits or proceedings which such counsel believes are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.
 
(e) On the Initial Remarketing Date and, if applicable, any Subsequent Remarketing Date and the Final Remarketing Date, the Company shall have furnished to
 
the Remarketing Agent a letter addressed to the Remarketing Agent and dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent, of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" with respect to certain financial information contained in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
 
(f) The Company shall have furnished to the Remarketing Agent a certificate, dated the Initial Remarketing Date and, if applicable, any Subsequent Remarketing Date and the Final Remarketing Date, of its President or any Vice President, stating that:
 
(i) the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Remarketing Date, and the Company performed all obligations and satisfied all conditions required of it under this Agreement; and
 
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before, or to such officer's knowledge, threatened by the Commission on the date hereof.
 
(g) Subsequent to fifteen Business Days prior to the Remarketing Date and prior to the Remarketing on the Remarketing Date, except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there shall not have occurred:
 
(i) any change in the common stock or long-term debt of the Company (other than (y) a decrease in the aggregate principal amount of such debt outstanding and (z) an increase in the aggregate principal amount of such debt outstanding due to the borrowing by Dominion Energy Brayton Point, LLC of $47,000,000 in connection with the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency's issuance of its Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds, (Dominion Energy Brayton Point Issue), Series 2006);
 
(ii) any material adverse change in the general affairs, financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; or
 
(iii) any material transaction entered into by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary other than a transaction in the ordinary course of business,
 
the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), is, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, so material and so adverse as to make it impracticable to proceed with the Remarketing on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement.
 
(h) Subsequent to fifteen Business Days prior to the Remarketing Date and prior to the Remarketing on the Remarketing Date, there shall not have occurred any of the following:
 
(i) a downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's senior unsecured notes, or securities that are to the Company's senior unsecured notes, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act) or any public announcement by any such organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of such securities;
pari passu
 
(ii) any general suspension of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or any limitation on prices for such trading or any restriction on the distribution of securities established by the New York Stock Exchange or by the Commission or by any federal or state agency or by the decision of any court;
 
(iii) a suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange;
 
(iv) a banking moratorium declared by federal or New York state authorities; or
 
(v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or crisis resulting in the declaration of a national emergency, or any material adverse change in the financial markets,
 
the effect of which outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, crisis or material adverse change, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, makes it impracticable to proceed with the Remarketing on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement.
 
(i) Without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Indenture shall not have been amended in any manner, or otherwise contain any provision not contained therein as of the date hereof that, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, materially changes the nature of the Remarketing Senior Notes or the Remarketing Procedures. The foregoing shall not require notice to, or the obtaining of consent from, the Remarketing Agent with respect to any amendment or change in the Indenture that does not materially change the nature of the Remarketing Senior Notes or the Remarketing Procedures.
 
(j) All corporate proceedings and other legal matters incident to the authorization, form and validity of this Agreement, the Indenture, the Remarketing Senior Notes, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus, the Registration Statement and all other legal matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be reasonably satisfactory in all material respects to counsel to the Remarketing Agent, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel all documents and information that they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
 
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Remarketing Agent.
 
Section 8.
Indemnification.
 
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and each person who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Remarketing Agent or any such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other statute or common law and to reimburse the Remarketing Agent and any such controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by the Remarketing Agent or any such controlling person in connection with investigation or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of, or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), (B) any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the Effective Date) or (C) the Time of Sale Information, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; that the indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 8(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of, or based upon, any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent for use therein. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 8(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent or any such controlling person, and shall survive the Remarketing of the Remarketing Senior Notes.
provided, however,
 
(b) The Remarketing Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigation or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), (B) any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the Effective Date) or (C) the Time of Sale Information, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to
 
state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent for use therein. The indemnity agreement of the Remarketing Agent contained in this Section 8(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the Remarketing of the Remarketing Senior Notes.
 
(c) Upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Remarketing Agent or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or
provided
 
not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
Section 9.
Contribution.
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were to be determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such claim or action. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
Section 10.
Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agent.
 
The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder by giving 60 days' prior written notice to the Company, the Depositary, the Indenture Trustee and the Purchase Contract Agent. The Company may, in its discretion, remove the Remarketing Agent by giving 60 days' prior written notice (or seven days' prior written notice on or after the Initial Remarketing Date if the Initial Remarketing is not successful) to the removed Remarketing Agent, the Depositary, the Indenture Trustee and the Purchase Contract Agent.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 10, no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which
 
it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of Sections 5, 8 and 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Section 11.
Dealing in the Remarketing Senior Notes.
 
The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketing Senior Notes. The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketing Senior Notes may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
 
Section 12.
Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.
 
The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Senior Notes. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement, the Indenture or the Senior Notes. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Indenture or the Senior Notes as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketing Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The Company and the Remarketing Agent each acknowledge and agree that in connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Remarketing Agent have an arms length business relationship that creates no fiduciary duty on the part of either party and each expressly disclaims any fiduciary relationship, except that the Remarketing Agent acknowledges that it owes a duty of trust or confidence to the Company as contemplated by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 100 (17 CFR 243.100) of Regulation FD under the Securities Exchange Act.
 
Section 13.
Termination.
 
This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 10. In addition, the obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may be terminated by it by notice given to the Company prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Remarketing Date if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(g), (h) and (i) shall have occurred.

We have been requested, as your special tax counsel, to render federal tax advice in connection with the remarketing of your 2002 Series A 5.75% Senior Notes due May 15, 2008 pursuant to the Company's Prospectus, dated February 13, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), which is a part of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-131810), and Prospectus Supplement, dated February 15, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Prospectus Supplement.
 
We have reviewed the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" and hereby advise you that we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although such discussion does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and the incorporation of this opinion by reference in the Registration Statement and to references to us under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement and under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. We do not admit by giving this consent that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
