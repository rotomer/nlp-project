Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 31, 2006, the Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) Organization, Compensation and Nominating (OCN) Committee approved the 2006 Long-Term Compensation Program (the Program) for its officers, including those officers named in Dominions 2006 Proxy Statement. The Program is being awarded pursuant to Dominions 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan and consists of two components of equal value: a restricted stock grant and a cash-based performance grant. The restricted stock is subject to a three year cliff vesting period, while payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of two performance metrics: total shareholder return and return on invested capital. Payout on the performance grant will be made by March 2008, with the amount of the award to vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics.
Also on March 31, 2006, the OCN Committee approved an amendment to the Employment C
ontinuity Agreement
(ECA) between Dominion and each officer. The ECA was amended to reflect a change in Dominions policy for pro-rata vesting for retirement, death, disability and termination without cause and (ii) to comply with new Internal Revenue Service rules for nonqualified deferred compensation.
The amendment makes the vesting of any equity grant dependent on the terms of each grant; with any grants made before April 2006 continuing to fully vest upon a change in control.
The Forms of Restricted Stock Grant and Performance Grants are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2. The amendment to the ECA is included as Exhibit A to the Form of Restricted Stock Grant.

and
 
_________
 
("Participant"), is made pursuant and subject to the provisions of the Dominion Resources, Inc. 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") to the extent provided below. All terms used herein that are defined in the Plan have the same meaning given them in the Plan. The Performance Grant will be administered by the Organization, Compensation and Nominating Committee (OCN Committee) of the Companys Board of Directors.
Total Shareholder Return Performance (TSR Performance) shall determine fifty percent (50%) of the Target Amount (TSR Percentage). TSR Performance is defined in Exhibit A. The Performance Period for the TSR Performance is the period beginning April 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2007. The portion of the 50% of the Target Amount that will be paid out, if any, is based on the following table.
 
To the extent that the Companys TSR Performance ranks in a percentile within the 1st, 2nd or 3rd Quartiles of Relative TSR Performance, then the TSR Percentage Payout shall be interpolated between the top and bottom of the Percentage Payout of TSR Percentage range for that Quartile.
No payment will be made if the TSR Performance is in the 4th Quartile, except that a payment of 25% of the TSR Percentage shall be made if the Companys TSR Performance was at least ___% on a compounded annual basis for the Performance Period.
Return on Invested Capital Performance (ROIC Performance) shall determine fifty percent (50%) of the Target Amount (ROIC Percentage). ROIC Performance is defined in Exhibit A. The Performance Period for the ROIC Performance is the period beginning January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2007. The portion of the 50% of the Target Amount that will be paid out is based on the following table.
 
To the extent that the Companys ROIC Performance is between ___% and ___%, then the ROIC Percentage payout shall be interpolated between the top and bottom of the applicable Percentage Payout of ROIC Percentage range set forth above.
The ROIC Performance in the table is based on the Companys actual 2006 budget and the projected 2007 budget at the date of grant. The ROIC Performance may be adjusted by the OCN Committee based on the Companys actual 2007 budget. Any adjustments to the ROIC Performance will be communicated to the Participant when made.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Company has caused this Agreement to be signed by a duly authorized officer.
 
 
EXHIBIT A
The TSR Performance will be measured based on where the Companys total shareholder return during the Performance Period ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period. In general, Total Shareholder Return consists of the difference between the value of a share of common stock at the beginning and end of the Performance Period, plus the value of dividends paid as if reinvested in stock and other appropriate adjustments for such events as stock splits. For purposes of TSR Performance, the total shareholder return of the Company and the Comparison Companies will be the total shareholder return as calculated by Bloomberg L.P. As soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Period, the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies will be obtained from Bloomberg L.P. and ranked from highest to lowest. The Companys total shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among the Comparison Companies.
The Comparison Companies are:
[list of companies]
ROIC shall mean Total Return divided by Average Invested Capital for the two-year Performance Period.
Total Return is Operating Earnings (as disclosed on the Companys earnings report filed on Form 8-K) + After-tax Interest & PSST Expenses + Preferred Dividends, all determined for the two-year Performance Period.
Average Invested Capital is the Average Balances for Long & Short-term Debt + PSST + MC + Preferred Equity + (Common Equity excluding AOCI). The Average Balances for a year are calculated by performing the calculation at the end of each month during the fiscal year plus the last month of the prior fiscal year and then averaging those amounts over 13 months. For the final calculation, the Average Invested Capital for 2006 and 2007 are combined.
PSST is the preferred securities of subsidiary trusts shown as junior subordinated notes payable to affiliated trusts (five subsidiary capital trusts) on the Companys financial statements.
 
MC is mandatory convertible debt.
AOCI is accumulated other comprehensive income as shown on the Companys financial statements.
