Exhibit 99
RICHMOND, Va. - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended June 30, 2006 of $161 million (46 cents per share) compared to net income of $332 million (97 cents per share) for the same period last year.
Operating earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2006 amounted to $295 million (84 cents per share) compared to operating earnings of $340 million (99 cents per share) for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the board of directors and for the companys annual incentive plan. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2006 and 2005 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Tom Farrell, president and chief executive officer, said:
The first six months of the year reflect operational strength across all of our businesses. Of note, our large coal units achieved the highest year-to-date capacity factor on record of 84.3 percent. Throughput in our wet gas system is up approximately 7 percent year to date. Virginias service territory continues to prosper, and our electric new connects grew 2.5 percent compared to the same period last year.
Last years second quarter included business interruption insurance income that did not recur in the second quarter of this year. After normalizing for the receipt of insurance income, our quarterly operating earnings compared favorably to last years second quarter.
In looking to the second half of the year, we have reached an agreement in principle on our outstanding business interruption insurance claims for Katrina and Rita. We anticipate recognizing the income in the third quarter. Additionally, we are revising our 2006 gas and oil production forecast upward, partially reflecting the early return of our production following the hurricanes.
With our solid second-quarter performance, our expected receipt of business interruption insurance income in the third quarter and our revised production estimate, we are affirming our full-year operating earnings guidance of $5.05 to $5.25 per share.
 
In affirming 2006 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected GAAP and operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on GAAP earnings. Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for operating earnings guidance.
Second-quarter 2006 operating earnings compared to 2005
Second-quarter 2006 operating earnings of 84 cents per share compares to 99 cents per share in the second quarter of 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of business interruption insurance income and lower sales of excess emissions allowances, partially offset by higher contributions from the companys merchant generation business.
Complete details of second-quarter 2006 operating earnings compared to 2005 can be found on Schedule 5 of this release.
Third-quarter 2006 operating earnings assumptions
In the third-quarter 2005, Dominion reported operating earnings of $1.08 per share. Third-quarter 2006 drivers that are expected to compare favorably to third-quarter 2005 include recovery of business interruption insurance income, higher contributions from the companys merchant generation business and lower unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses. Partial offsets include an expected return to normal weather in the electric utility service area, lower sales of excess emissions allowances and a scheduled refueling outage at our Kewaunee power station.
Dominions third-quarter 2006 operating earnings assumptions compared to 2005 can be found on Schedule 6 of this release
.
