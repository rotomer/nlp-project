The Representatives shall have received, prior to payment for the Junior Subordinated Notes, a certificate dated the Closing Date and signed by the President or any Vice President of the Company to the effect that no such stop order is in effect and that no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission.
(ii) On the Closing Date the Representatives shall receive, on behalf of the several Underwriters, the opinions of Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel to the
 
Underwriters, McGuireWoods LLP, counsel to the Company, and the Company's General Counsel, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Schedules III, IV and V, respectively.
(iii) The Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date letters addressed to the Representatives containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' SAS 72 "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, including any pro forma financial information.
(iv) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (A) except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (exclusive of amendments or supplements after the date hereof), there shall not have occurred (1) any change in the debt securities of the Company of the same class as the Junior Subordinated Notes or any class senior to the Junior Subordinated Notes (other than a decrease in the aggregate principal amount thereof outstanding), (2) any material adverse change in the general affairs, financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (3) any material transaction entered into by the Company other than a transaction in the ordinary course of business, the effect of which in each such case in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is so material and so adverse that it makes it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement, and (B) there shall not have occurred (1) a downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's Junior Subordinated Notes, or securities that areto the Company's Junior Subordinated Notes, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act) and no such organization shall have given any notice of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change with possible negative implications in its ratings of such securities, (2) any general suspension of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or any limitation on prices for such trading or any restrictions on the distribution of securities established by the New York Stock Exchange or by the Commission or by any federal or state agency or by the decision of any court, (3) a suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (4) a banking moratorium declared either by federal or New York State authorities or (5) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or crisis resulting in the declaration of a national emergency, or any material adverse change in the financial markets; provided the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, crisis or material adverse change shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement.
pari passu
 
(v) On the Closing Date, the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be true and correct as if made on and as of such date, and the Company shall have performed all obligations and satisfied all conditions required of it under this Agreement; and, on the Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received a certificate to such effect signed by the President or any Vice President of the Company.
(vi) All legal proceedings to be taken in connection with the issuance and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall have been satisfactory in form and substance to Troutman Sanders LLP.
(b) In case any of the conditions specified above in Section 7(a) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives upon mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however, that in case the conditions specified in subsections 7(a)(v) and (vi) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may not be so terminated by the Representatives unless Underwriters who have agreed to purchase in the aggregate 50% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall have consented to such termination and the aforesaid notice shall so state. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 7(c) and 9 hereof.
(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (in addition to the fees and disbursements of their outside counsel as provided in Section 6(h)) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder and, upon such reimbursement, the Company shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 6(c) and 9.
8. . The obligation of the Company to deliver the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 7(a)(i) and in Section 7(a)(ii). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Representatives. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 9 and 10 hereof.
Conditions of the Obligation of the Company
9. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person who controls any Underwriter within the
 
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each such Underwriter, director, officer, and controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used on or prior to the date hereof), the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, in any Preliminary Prospectus or in the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 9(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, and each person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the Time of Sale Information or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter for
 
use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to either thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the respective Underwriters contained in this Section 9(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(c) The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that, upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company, or against such Underwriter or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; provided that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall,
 
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
10. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes, then the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes which such defaulting
Termination
 
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so fail or refuse to purchase Junior Subordinated Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Junior Subordinated Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter (except as provided in Sections 6(g) and 9) or of the Company (except as provided in Sections 6(b) and 9). In any such case not involving a termination, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
12. . The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company, the Underwriters and, with respect to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each controlling person and each officer and director of the Company and the Underwriters referred to in Section 9, and their respective successors, assigns, executors and administrators. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. The term "successors" as used in this Agreement shall not include any purchaser, as such, of any of the Junior Subordinated Notes from any of the several Underwriters. The Company and the Underwriters each acknowledge and agree that in connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Underwriters have an arms length business relationship that creates no fiduciary duty on the part of either party and each expressly disclaims any fiduciary relationship, except that the Underwriters acknowledge that they owe a duty of trust or confidence to the Company as contemplated by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 100 (17 CFR 243.100) of Regulation FD under the Securities Exchange Act.
Miscellaneous
13. . All communications hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to the Representatives at the address set forth on Schedule II hereto, or if to the Company shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to it, attention of Treasurer, Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 (facsimile number: (804) 819-2211).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the arrangements for issuance by Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company) of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2006 Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes Due 2066 (the Junior Subordinated Notes) and the offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes by you pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated September 26, 2006 by and between you and the Company (the
 
Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals or copies certified to our satisfaction of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
In addition, we attended the closing held today at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement that are required to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.
Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Prospectus.
2. No approval or consent by any public regulatory body is legally required in connection with the sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement (except to the extent that compliance with the provisions of securities or blue sky laws of certain states may be required in connection with the sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes in such states) and the carrying out of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
5. The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when completed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture,
 
except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
6. The Registration Statement with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Junior Subordinated Notes in the manner therein specified.
7. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except that we express no comment or belief with respect to any historical or pro forma financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
8. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES, as supplemented by the statements under SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, and the statements relating to the Replacement Capital Covenant contained under CERTAIN TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, are substantially accurate and fair.
9. With regard to the discussion in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, under the caption CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering the aforementioned opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
We have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes statistical statements in the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the
 
accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraphs 8 and 9 in regard to the statements described in such paragraphs 8 and 9. We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus as it was initially issued and as it has been supplemented or amended, and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Underwriting Agreement. None of the foregoing participation, review or attendance disclosed to us any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, or the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued or the date it was supplemented or amended, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto, and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (or, with respect to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, now omits) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1)  (9) above and in making the statements expressed in the preceding paragraph, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
TROUTMAN SANDERS LLP

as Representatives for the Underwriters
listed in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2006 Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes Due 2066 (the Junior Subordinated Notes) pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated
 
September 26, 2006, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
On this basis we are of the opinion that:
1. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement or the due execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
2. The Indenture has been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
3. The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when completed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
4. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-135112) with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission
 
not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Junior Subordinated Notes in the manner therein specified.
5. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
6. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES, as supplemented by the statements under SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, and the statements relating to the Replacement Capital Covenant contained under CERTAIN TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, are substantially accurate and fair.
7. With regard to the discussion in the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006, under the caption CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering the aforementioned opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus were discussed, and we have consulted with officers and other employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. We have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which our investigation led us to deem pertinent. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement. We have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which our investigation did not lead us to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in
 
the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraphs 6 and 7 in regard to the statements described in such paragraphs 6 and 7. But such conferences, consultation, examination and attendance disclosed to us no information with respect to such other matters that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, the Prospectus contained on the date it was issued, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules and other financial information and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or Prospectus), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such date or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is provided on the basis that, except as otherwise provided in Section 3A(a) of the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Time of Sale Information, any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
The arrangements for issuance of up to up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2006 Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes Due 2066 (the Junior Subordinated Notes), of Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated September 26, 2006, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement), have been taken under my supervision as Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
As Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, I have general responsibility over the attorneys within the Company's Legal Department responsible for rendering legal counsel to the Company regarding corporate, financial, securities and other matters. I am generally familiar with the organization, business and affairs of the Company. I am also familiar with the proceedings taken and proposed to be taken by the Company in connection with the offering and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of the law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, I have responsibility for supervising lawyers who may have been asked by me or others to review legal matters arising in connection with the offering and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Accordingly, some of the matters referred to herein have not been handled personally by me, but I have been made familiar with the facts and circumstances and the applicable law, and the opinions herein expressed are my own or are opinions of others in which I concur.
 
On this basis I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the respective laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
4. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' properties is subject other than any proceedings described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
I am a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Virginia and I do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent. I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein resulting from matters that may hereinafter arise or that may hereinafter be brought to my attention.
Yours very truly,

The Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes is September 30, 2066, which may not be shortened or extended.
2.2 Stated Maturity.
2.3 Form and Payment; Minimum Transfer Restriction.
(a) The Junior Subordinated Notes shall be issued in fully registered definitive form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable, the transfer of such Junior Subordinated Notes will be registrable and such Junior Subordinated Notes will be exchangeable for Junior Subordinated Notes bearing identical terms and provisions
 
at the principal office of the Trustee; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such address as shall appear in the Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Paying Agent by the Record Date. The Register for the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be kept at the principal office of the Trustee, and the Trustee is hereby appointed registrar and Paying Agent for the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(b) The Junior Subordinated Notes may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes in a denomination of less than $1,000 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever. Any such transferee shall be deemed not to be the holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes for any purpose, including but not limited to the receipt of payments in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes and such transferee shall be deemed to have no interest whatsoever in such Junior Subordinated Notes.
The Junior Subordinated Notes will be issued to the holders in accordance with the following procedures:
2.4 Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Junior Subordinated Notes; Restrictions on Transfers; Depositary.
(a) So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the Depositary, or unless required by law, all Junior Subordinated Notes that are so eligible will be represented by one or more Junior Subordinated Notes in global form (a "Global Note") registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. Except as provided in Section 2.4(c) below, beneficial owners of a Global Note shall not be entitled to have Definitive Note Certificates registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Note Certificates and will not be registered holders of such Global Notes.
(b) The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in Global Notes shall be effected through the Depositary in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures and standing instructions of the Depositary and the Trustee shall make appropriate endorsements to reflect increases or decreases in principal amounts of such Global Notes.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in this Section 2.4(c)), a Global Note may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Junior Subordinated Notes registered, and no transfer of a Global Note may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof unless (i) such Depositary (A) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Note or (B) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act and no successor Depositary has been appointed by the Company within 90 days after its receipt of such notice or its becoming aware of such ineligibility, (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, or any event which after notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default under the Indenture, with respect to such Note, or (iii) the Company, in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary, instructs the Trustee to exchange such Global Note for a Junior Subordinated Note that is not a Global Note (in which case such exchange (subject to such procedures) shall be effected by the Trustee).
 
The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes. Initially, the Global Notes shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co.
Definitive Junior Subordinated Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of a Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall deliver such definitive Junior Subordinated Notes to the person in whose names such definitive Junior Subordinated Notes are so registered.
So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes, (i) the registrar for the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the clearing agency for all purposes of the Indenture relating to such Global Notes as the sole holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes evidenced by such Global Notes and shall have no obligations to the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes; and (ii) the rights of the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes shall be exercised only through the clearing agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such holders and the clearing agency and/or the participants in the clearing agency.
At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been paid, redeemed, exchanged, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Junior Subordinated Notes, redeemed by the Company pursuant to Article III or canceled, or transferred for part of a Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary be reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by, or at the direction of, the Trustee to reflect such reduction or increase.
2.5 Interest.
(a) Each Junior Subordinated Note will bear interest at (i) the rate of 6.30% per annum (the "Fixed Coupon Rate") until September 30, 2011 (the "Fixed Rate Period"), and (ii) the Three-Month LIBOR Rate plus 2.30% per annum, reset quarterly on the LIBOR Rate Reset Dates (the "Floating Coupon Rate" and, together with the Fixed Coupon Rate, the "Coupon Rate"), from September 30, 2011 up to, but not including, the Stated Maturity (the "Floating Rate Period"), and will bear interest on any overdue principal at the then prevailing Coupon Rate and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the then prevailing Coupon Rate ("Additional Interest"), compounded semi-annually for the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly for the Floating Rate Period, payable (subject to the provisions of Article IV) semi-annually in arrears on the 30
th
day of March and September of each year during the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly in arrears
 
on the 30
th
day of March, June, September and December of each year during the Floating Rate Period (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on March 30, 2007 for the Fixed Rate Period and December 30, 2011 for the Floating Rate Period to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered, subject to certain exceptions, at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The "Record Date" for payment of interest will be the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless such Junior Subordinated Note is registered to a holder other than the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
(b) During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and during the Floating Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360. During the Fixed Rate Period, if an Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable. During the Floating Rate Period, if any Interest Payment Date, other than a redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. Also, if a redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after a redemption date or the Stated Maturity. During the Floating Rate Period, if any LIBOR Rate Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. During the Floating Rate Period, the interest rate in effect on any LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on that date and the interest rate applicable to any other day will be the interest rate as reset on the immediately preceding LIBOR Rate Reset Date.
An Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes provided that the nonpayment of interest for so long as and to the extent that interest is permitted to be deferred pursuant to Article IV herein shall not be deemed to be a default in the payment of interest for the purposes of Article VI of the Base Indenture and shall not otherwise be deemed an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be an Event of Default except those that are specifically identified as an Event of Default under the Indenture.
2.6 Events of Default.
 
If a Tax Event shall occur and be continuing, the Company may redeem the Junior Subordinated Notes within 90 days after the occurrence of that Tax Event, in whole but not in part, before September 30, 2011, at the Tax Event Make-Whole Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the redemption date. The Tax Event Make-Whole Amount shall be paid prior to 2:30 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such redemption, provided that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Tax Event Make-Whole Amount by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such Tax Event Make-Whole Amount is to be paid. The Company will notify the Trustee of the amount of the Tax Event Make-Whole Amount promptly after the calculation thereof, and the Trustee will not be responsible for such calculation.

The Company shall have the option to redeem the Junior Subordinated Notes (i) at any time, in whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount (the "Optional Redemption Price") plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the redemption date on one or more occasions on or after September 30, 2011 or (ii) at any time, in whole or in part, before September 30, 2011 at the Make-Whole Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the redemption date. The Optional Redemption Price or the Make-Whole Amount, as applicable, shall be paid prior to 2:30 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such redemption, provided that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Optional Redemption Price or the Make-Whole Amount, as applicable, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such Optional Redemption Price or the Make-Whole Amount, as applicable, is to be paid. The Company will notify the Trustee of the amount of the Make-Whole Amount promptly after the calculation thereof, and the Trustee will not be responsible for such calculation.

Subject to Article III of the Base Indenture, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Article III will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed at such holder's registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the applicable redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest shall cease to accrue on such Junior Subordinated Notes called for redemption.
3.3 Notice of Redemption.
At the Company's option, it may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of interest payments may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period.
4.1 Option to Defer Interest Payments.
 
Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the Coupon Rate then applicable to the Junior Subordinated Notes, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes, it will not and its Subsidiaries shall not do any of the following:
 
 
 
However, at any time, including during an Optional Deferral Period, the Company may:
 
 
 
The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of any optional deferral of interest at least 10 Business Days and not more than 60 Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee shall forward such notice promptly to each holder of record of Junior Subordinated Notes.
4.2 Notice of Extension.
In connection with the offering, sale and issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company shall:
5.1 Payment of Expenses.
(a) pay all costs and expenses relating to the offering, sale and issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes, including commissions to the Underwriters payable pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and compensation of the Trustee under the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.6 of the Base Indenture; and
 
(b) be primarily liable for any indemnification obligations arising with respect to the Underwriting Agreement.
Upon termination of this Second Supplemental Indenture or the Base Indenture or the removal or resignation of the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.10 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all amounts owed to it under Section 7.6 of the Base Indenture accrued to the date of such termination, removal or resignation.
5.2 Payment Upon Resignation or Removal.

Additional Junior Subordinated Notes without limitation as to amount, and without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes, may also be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 2.1 of the Base Indenture. Any such additional Junior Subordinated Notes will have the same Stated Maturity and other terms as those initially issued and shall be consolidated with and part of the same series of Notes as the Junior Subordinated Notes initially issued under this Second Supplemental Indenture.

Registered Holder:
DOMINION RESOURCES, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (herein referred to as the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Holder named above, the principal sum [of Dollars]
                                    
**[specified in the Schedule annexed hereto]
*** on September 30, 2066 (the "Stated Maturity"), in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. The Company further promises to pay to the registered Holder of this note (the "Note") as hereinafter provided (a) interest on said principal sum (subject to deferral as set forth herein) at the rate of 6.30% per annum, in like coin or currency, semi-annually in arrears on the 30
th
day of March and September until September 30, 2011 and at the rate per annum equal to the Three-Month LIBOR Rate plus 2.30% (determined in the manner set forth in the Second Supplemental Indenture hereinafter referred to), reset quarterly on the LIBOR Rate Reset Dates, in like coin or currency, quarterly in arrears on the 30
th
day of March, June, September and December (each an "Interest Payment Date") commencing March 30, 2007 in the first instance and December 30, 2011 in the second instance, from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date hereof to which interest has been paid or duly provided for (unless (i) no interest has yet been paid or duly provided for on this Note, in which case from September 29, 2006, or (ii) the date hereof is before an Interest Payment Date but after the related Record Date (as defined below), in which case from such following Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if the Company shall default in payment of the interest due on such following Interest Payment Date, then from the next preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or if no interest has yet been paid or duly provided for on this Note, in which case from September 29, 2006), until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for, plus (b) Additional Interest, as
 
defined in the Indenture, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on any interest payment that is not made on the applicable Interest Payment Date, which shall accrue at the then prevailing rate per annum borne by this Note, compounded semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable.
The interest so payable will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date. The Record Date shall be the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless this Note is registered to a holder other than The Depository Trust Company or a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, in which case the Record Date will be the fifteenth calendar day preceding such Interest Payment Date whether or not a Business Day. This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest at the principal corporate trust office of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as paying agent for the Company, maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company (i) by check mailed to such address of the person entitled thereto as the address shall appear on the Register of the Notes or (ii) by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Record Date. While this Note bears interest at a fixed rate, interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and while this Note bears interest at the Three-Month LIBOR Rate, the amount of interest payable on this Note for any period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period divided by 360.
At the Company's option, it may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of interest payments may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period.
Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the Coupon Rate then applicable to the Junior Subordinated Notes, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes, it will not and its Subsidiaries shall not do any of the following:
 
 
 
However, at any time, including during an Optional Deferral Period, the Company may:
 
 
 
The Company shall give the Trustee written notice of any optional deferral of interest at least 10 Business Days and not more than 60 Business Days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date. The Trustee shall forward such notice promptly to each holder of record of Junior Subordinated Notes.
This Note is issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture II (the "Original Indenture"), dated as of June 1, 2006, between the Company, as issuer, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 and a Second Supplemental Indenture (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") dated as of September 1, 2006 (as so supplemented and as further supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Indenture"). Reference is made to the Indenture for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders (the word "Holder" or "Holders" meaning the registered holder or registered holders) of the Notes. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Original Indenture as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture.
The Notes of this series shall have an initial aggregate principal amount of Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000).
The Notes evidenced by this Certificate may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Notes in a denomination of less than $1,000 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Note, including the principal hereof and interest hereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to Holders of Priority Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Note, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture.
 
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, DOMINION RESOURCES, INC. has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
This is one of the Securities, of the series designated herein, referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions in the Indenture, the Company shall have the option to redeem the Notes of this series at any time on or after September 30, 2011, in whole or in part, at the Optional Redemption Price and in whole or in part, before September, 30, 2011 at the Make-Whole Amount plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

In the case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes of this series may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
Any consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note given as provided in the Indenture (unless effectively revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange, registration of transfer, or otherwise in lieu hereof irrespective of whether any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Notes. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note, at the places, at the respective times, at the rates and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Register of the Notes of this series upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the offices maintained by the Company or its agent for such purpose, duly endorsed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, but without payment of any charge other than a sum sufficient to reimburse the Company for any tax or other governmental charge incident thereto. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Note or Notes of authorized denomination or denominations for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name this Note shall be registered upon the Register of the Notes of this series as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest due hereon and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
The Company and, by acceptance of this Note or a beneficial interest in this Note, each holder hereof and any person acquiring a beneficial interest herein, agree that for United States federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Note constitute indebtedness.

The Notes are being issued under the Junior Subordinated Indenture II dated as of June 1, 2006, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), to be supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 1, 2006 (collectively the "Indenture"), the unanimous written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company dated January 24, 2006 and the Approval of Authorized Officers dated September 26, 2006, and are being offered to the public in accordance with an Underwriting Agreement, dated September 26, 2006, among the Company and the Underwriters named on Schedule I thereto.

On the basis of such examination and review, we advise you that, in our opinion, when the Notes have been duly issued and sold in the manner contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, and assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.

Exhibit 8
Dominion Resources, Inc.
120 Tredegar Street
Richmond, Virginia 23219
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Dominion"), in connection with the Registration Statement filed on June 19, 2006, as amended through the date hereof, and the Prospectus Supplement dated September 26, 2006 (the "Offering Documents"), for the purpose of offering $500,000,000 principal amount of 2006 Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due September 30, 2066.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined the Junior Subordinated Indenture II, dated as of June 1, 2006, the form of Second Indenture to Junior Subordinated Indenture II of Dominion, and the form of Note, each to be entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Offering Documents and such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion.
In our examination, we have assumed that (i) the statements concerning the issuance of the Notes contained in the Offering Documents are true, correct and complete, (ii) the terms of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph will be complied with, (iii) the factual representations made to us by the Dominion in its officer's certificate dated as of the date hereof and delivered to us for purposes of this opinion (the "Officer's Certificate") are true, correct and complete, and (iv) any factual representations made in the Offering Documents or the Officer's Certificate "to the best knowledge of," in the "belief" of, or similarly qualified are true, correct and complete without such qualification. If any of the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the issuance of the Notes is consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which it is described in the Offering Documents, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.
Subject to and based solely upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that (1) the Notes will be treated as indebtedness of Dominion for United States federal income tax purposes (although there is no controlling authority directly on point) and (2) insofar as it relates to matters of United Stated federal income tax law, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" is a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein.
Our opinion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Regulations (including temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations) issued thereunder, Internal Revenue Service rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Our opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein. Our opinion is rendered only as of the date hereof, and its validity could be affected by subsequent changes in applicable law. We have not undertaken to advise you or any other person with respect to any such change subsequent to the date hereof. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court would not take a contrary position with respect to any of the conclusions contained herein.
We are rendering this opinion to you solely in connection with the offering of the Notes, and this opinion is not to be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
