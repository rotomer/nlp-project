The restricted stock is subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, while payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of two performance metrics: total shareholder return versus the 2007 peer group and return on invested capital. Payout on the performance grant will be made by March 15, 2009, with the amount of the award to vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics. The Forms of Restricted Stock Grant and Performance Grants under the Program are included as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2.
Also on March 30, 2007, the CGN Committee approved a separate 2007 Long-Term Compensation Program for the President and Chief Executive Officer of Dominion Exploration & Production, Inc. (the E&P Program). The E&P Program is being awarded pursuant to Dominions 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan and consists of two components: a restricted stock grant and a cash-based performance grant. The restricted stock is subject to a one year vesting period, while the payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of funding and payout goals established for the Dominion Exploration & Production segment under Dominions 2007 Annual Incentive Plan. Payout on the performance grant will be made by March 15, 2008, with the amount of the award to vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics.

No payment will be made if the TSR Performance is in the 4th Quartile, except that a payment of 25% of the TSR Percentage shall be made if the Companys TSR Performance was at least

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) are determined under policies established by the CGN Committee. The calculations of the performance measures are summarized below.
The TSR Performance will be measured based on where the Companys total shareholder return during the Performance Period ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period. TSR reflects the change in stock price during the Performance Period plus any dividends paid.
The Comparison Companies are:
The list of Comparison Companies is subject to adjustment in accordance with policies established by the CGN Committee. Any adjustments to the list of Comparison Companies will be communicated to the Participant when made.
ROIC reflects the Companys total return divided by average invested capital for the Performance Period
.
For this purpose, total return is the Companys operating earnings plus its after-tax interest and related charges plus preferred dividends. In accordance with policies established by the CGN Committee, the ROIC Performance may be adjusted negatively by the CGN Committee based on the Companys performance under the final approved ROIC goals for non-executive officers for their 2007 performance grants. Any adjustments to the ROIC Performance will be communicated to the Participant when made.
