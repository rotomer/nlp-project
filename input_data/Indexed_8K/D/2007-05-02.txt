Exhibit 99
RICHMOND, Va. - Dominion (NYSE: D) announced today unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2007 of $453 million ($1.29 per share) compared to net income of $534 million ($1.53 per share) for the same period last year.
Operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2007 amounted to $525 million ($1.50 per share) compared to operating earnings of $573
million ($1.64 per
share) for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, reporting to the board of directors and for the companys annual incentive plan. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2007 and 2006 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
Our first-quarter results again reflect the strength of the core businesses that will remain after we successfully reposition the company. Adjusting for the impact of weather and unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses, first-quarter 2007 total operating earnings per share for our delivery, energy and generation segments were 9 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2006.
As indicated by our announcement that we have reached an agreement to sell our offshore gas and oil operations, we remain on target to carry out our strategic initiatives. Robust economic growth in Virginia, combined with planned expansions in merchant generation, natural gas pipelines and storage, will position us to grow long-term operating earnings per share 4 to 6 percent on an average annual basis.
First-quarter 2007 operating earnings compared to 2006
First-quarter 2007 operating earnings of $1.50 per share compare to operating earnings of $1.64 per share in the first quarter of 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of a mark-to-market benefit from hedges de-designated following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, higher unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses, lower contributions from the companys producer services business, and higher DD&A expenses in the companys E&P business. These negatives were partially offset by a return to comparatively normal weather in the electric and gas utility service areas and higher contributions from the companys retail energy marketing, gas transmission and merchant generation businesses.
 
Complete details of first-quarter 2007 operating earnings compared to 2006 can be found on Schedules 4 and 5 of this release.

This release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our projected future long-term operating earnings growth rate, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations may include factors that are beyond the company's ability to control or estimate precisely, such as fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, including changes in the cost of fuel for our regulated electric business, the timing of the closing dates of acquisitions or divestitures (including our divestiture of The Peoples Natural Gas Company and Hope Gas, Inc. and any divestiture of our natural gas and oil assets), the amount of net proceeds received from any divestitures, additional risk exposure associated with the termination of business interruption and offshore property damage related to our exploration and production operations and our inability to replace such insurance on commercially reasonable terms, estimates of future market conditions, estimates of proved and unproved reserves, the companys ability to meet its natural gas and oil production forecasts, the behavior of other market participants, and the effects of hurricanes on our operations, gas and oil production and realized prices. Other factors include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, governmental regulations, economic conditions in the company's service area, risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures, changes to regulated gas and electric rates collected by Dominion, risks associated with the realignment of our operating assets (including the potential dilutive effect on earnings in the near term, costs associated with any sale of our exploration and production business and the redeployment of proceeds from any sales), changes to rating agency requirements and ratings, changing financial accounting standards, trading counter-party credit risks, risks related to energy trading and marketing, and other uncertainties. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominions most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
