RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2008, of $680 million ($1.18 per share) compared to net income of $453 million (65 cents per share) for the same period in 2007.
Operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2008, amounted to $578 million ($1.00 per share) compared to operating earnings of $518 million (74 cents per share) for the same period in 2007.  Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts.  Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2008 and 2007 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
We had an outstanding quarter operationally, and w Despite warmer than normal weather in our Virginia service area, our quarterly results exceeded the upper end of our guidance range.
e continue to provide excellent service while developing growth projects across our regulated and nonregulated businesses.
The quarter positions us to meet our 2008 earnings target. We affirm our operating earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.15 per share for the year and reiterate our expected annual earnings per share growth rate of at least 6 percent.
First-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to guidance
First-quarter 2008 operating earnings of $1.00 per share compare to guidance of 89 cents to 94 cents per share.  Drivers that compared favorably to guidance include contributions from the generation businesses and certain tax benefits.  Factors that compared negatively to guidance include warmer-than-normal-weather and storm restoration-related expenses in the companys electric utility service area.
First-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007
The increase in first-quarter 2008 operating earnings per share as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses due to the deferral of fuel expenses in excess of current period recovery; higher contributions from the merchant generation business; higher volumes and realized prices from the companys remaining E&P operations, including volumes associated with reacquired overriding royalty interests arising from the volumetric production payment agreements terminated in 2007; lower interest expense; and accretion due to share repurchases.  These positives were partially offset by the absence of earnings resulting from the  divestiture of the companys U.S. E&P operations; the exclusion of earnings from Peoples Natural Gas and Hope Gas, Inc.; and warmer-than-normal-weather in the companys electric utility service area.
Complete details of first-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Second-quarter 2008 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects second-quarter 2008 operating earnings in the range of 47 cents to 52 cents per share.  This compares to operating earnings of 44 cents per share in the second-quarter of 2007.  Drivers expected to compare favorably to 2007 include the absence of unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses due to the deferral of fuel expenses in excess of current period recovery; higher volumes and realized prices for the companys remaining E&P operations, including volumes associated with reacquired overriding royalty interests arising from the volumetric production payment agreements terminated in 2007; lower interest expense; and accretion due to share repurchases. Expected offsets include the absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys U.S. E&P operations; a return to normal weather in our electric utility service area;  higher maintenance and depreciation expenses in our electric utility businesses; and the exclusion of earnings from Peoples Natural Gas and Hope Gas, Inc. Complete details of the companys second-quarter 2008 guidance can be found in Dominions first-quarter 2008 Earnings Release Kit published this morning on Dominions Web page under Financial Modeling, Earnings Release Kits at http://.

In providing its second-quarter 2008 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there will be differences between expected 2008 GAAP and operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on GAAP earnings. Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance and outlook.
