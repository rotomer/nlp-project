RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended June 30, 2008, of $298 million (51 cents per share) compared to a loss of $530 million (76 cents per share) for the same period in 2007.
Operating earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2008, amounted to $289 million (50 cents per share) compared to operating earnings of $310 million (44 cents per share) for the same period in 2007.  Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts.  Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2008 and 2007 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
This quarter was notable not only for our excellent operational results but also for our continued success in implementing our major strategic initiatives. We obtained approval to begin construction of our coal and biomass plant in Southwest Virginia; we reached an agreement to sell drilling rights for a portion of our Marcellus acreage in Appalachia; and we also announced our intent to construct a pipeline from the Appalachian basin to markets on the East Coast. These actions position us to achieve our expected future earnings growth and remain a leader in energy infrastructure.
In consideration of our year-to-date operating earnings and our limited sensitivity to commodity price changes, we are comfortable in tightening our 2008 operating earnings guidance range per share from $3.05 to $3.15 to $3.10 to $3.15.
We are also raising our 2009 operating earnings outlook per share from $3.25 to $3.40 to $3.30 to $3.45. This change reflects expected positive impacts of sale of Marcellus shale drilling rights and higher margins from our generation business. We reiterate our expected annual operating earnings per share growth rate of at least 6 percent.
Second-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to guidance
Second-quarter 2008 operating earnings of 50 cents per share compare to guidance of 47 cents to 52 cents per share.  Drivers that compared favorably to guidance include contributions from the generation and gas transmission businesses, warmer-than- normal weather in the companys electric utility service area and contributions from Dominion Retail.  Factors that compared negatively to guidance include storm restoration-related expenses in the companys electric utility service area; lower contributions from the producer services business; and certain state tax impacts.
Second-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007
The increase in second-quarter 2008 operating earnings per share as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of unrecovered Virginia fuel expenses due to the deferral of fuel expenses in excess of current period recovery; higher margins from the merchant generation business; higher volumes and realized prices from the companys remaining E&P operations, including volumes associated with reacquired overriding royalty interests arising from the volumetric production payment agreements terminated in 2007; lower interest expense; and accretion due to share repurchases in 2007.  These positives were partially offset by the absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the majority of the companys U.S. E&P operations and an increase in outage costs within the generation business.
Complete details of second-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Third-quarter 2008 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects third-quarter 2008 operating earnings in the range of 87 cents to 92 cents per share.  This compares to operating earnings of 86 cents per share in the third quarter of 2007.  Drivers expected to compare favorably to 2007 include higher contributions from its merchant generation business; growth in electric utility sales; higher volumes and realized prices for the companys remaining E&P operations, including volumes associated with reacquired overriding royalty interests arising from the volumetric production payment agreements terminated in 2007; and accretion due to share repurchases in 2007.
Expected offsets include a return to normal weather in its electric utility service area; higher maintenance and depreciation expenses in the companys electric and gas utility businesses; and the impact of certain state income tax legislation enacted in July 2008. Complete details of the companys third-quarter 2008 guidance can be found in Dominions second-quarter 2008 Earnings Release Kit published this morning on Dominions Web page under Financial Modeling, Earnings Release Kits at http://.

In providing its third-quarter, full year 2008 and full year 2009 operating earnings outlook, the company notes that there will be differences between expected GAAP and operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on GAAP earnings. Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance and outlook.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations may include factors that are beyond the company's ability to control or estimate precisely, such as fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, the timing of the closing dates of acquisitions or divestitures, estimates of future market conditions, estimates of proved and unproved reserves, the companys ability to meet its natural gas and oil production forecasts, the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned projects, acquisitions and divestitures, and the ability to complete planned construction or expansion projects as scheduled.  Other factors include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes on operations, the behavior of other market participants, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments and changes to environmental and other laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, greenhouse gases and other emissions to which we are subject, economic conditions in the company's service area, risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures, changes to regulated gas and electric rates collected by Dominion, changes to rating agency requirements and ratings, changing financial accounting standards, trading counter-party credit risks, risks related to energy trading and marketing, adverse outcomes in litigation matters, and other uncertainties.  Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominions most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
