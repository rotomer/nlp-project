RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited net income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2008, of $508 million (87 cents per share). This compares to net income of $2.3 billion ($3.62 per share) for the same period in 2007, which primarily reflected the benefit from the sale of the majority of the companys non-Appalachian E&P operations.
Operating earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2008, amounted to $545 million (94 cents per share) compared to operating earnings of $551 million (86 cents per share) for the same period in 2007.  Operating earnings are defined as GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings outlook and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payout ratios.  Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2008 and 2007 GAAP earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
Amid the present economic turmoil and despite unfavorable weather, our quarterly earnings exceeded the top end of our provided guidance. Year to date, we continue to see strong results, driven by our generation and energy infrastructure businesses.
We feel comfortable affirming our full year guidance of $3.10 to $3.15 operating earnings per share, as well as our 2009 outlook of $3.30 to $3.45 operating earnings per share.
Given its confidence in the strength of our companys earnings and business model, the board of directors recently declared our fourth-quarter dividend and reconfirmed our dividend policy to sustain increases in 2009 and 2010 that will allow us to reach our targeted 2010 payout ratio of 55 percent.
Third-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to guidance
Third-quarter 2008 operating earnings of 94 cents per share compare favorably to guidance of 87 cents to 92 cents per share.  Drivers that compared favorably to guidance include higher contributions from the producer services business, lower expenses at the utility generation business and higher contributions from the gas distribution business. Factors that compared negatively to guidance include milder-than-normal weather in the companys electric utility service area and lower contributions from Dominion Retail.
Third-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007
The increase in third-quarter 2008 operating earnings per share as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to higher margins from the merchant generation business, higher contributions from the producer services business and accretion due to share repurchases in 2007. These positives were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and milder-than-normal weather in the companys electric utility service area. Complete details of third-quarter 2008 operating earnings compared to 2007 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Fourth-quarter 2008 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects fourth-quarter 2008 operating earnings in the range of 67 cents per share to 72 cents per share.  This compares to operating earnings of 52 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Drivers expected to compare favorably to 2007 include higher contributions from the merchant generation business, lower outage expenses at the utility generation business, higher contributions from the gas distribution and gas transmission businesses and higher margins from the companys remaining E&P operations.
Expected offsets include the absence of earnings from Peoples Natural Gas and Hope Gas, Inc.; lower contributions from the companys producer services business; higher depreciation and amortization expense at the electric utility; and higher interest expense. Complete details of the companys fourth-quarter 2008 guidance can be found in Dominions third-quarter 2008 Earnings Release Kit published this morning on Dominions Web page under Financial Modeling, Earnings Release Kits at http://.

In providing its fourth-quarter, full year 2008 guidance and full year 2009 operating earnings outlook, the company notes that there will be differences between expected GAAP and operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on GAAP earnings. Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance and outlook.
