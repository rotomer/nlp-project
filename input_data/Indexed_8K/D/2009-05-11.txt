Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 23, 2009, the Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) Compensation, Governance and Nominating (CGN) Committee recommended amendments to the 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan), and on February 24, 2009, the Dominion Board of Directors approved, subject to shareholder approval, the amended and restated 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Amended Plan).  The Amended Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 5, 2009.
The Amended Plan provides for:  (i) an extension of the term under the initial Plan until the date after the 2016 Annual Meeting; (ii) an increase in the number of reserved shares from 30 million to 36 million shares; (iii) shareholder approval of performance criteria required by the Internal Revenue Service, including four new performance criteria based on book value, environmental considerations, safety and reliability; and (iv) clarifications for compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the Amended Plan the following types of incentive awards may be granted to eligible employees of Dominion and its subsidiaries:  performance grants, restricted stock grants, goal-based stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs).  Performance grants are subject to the achievement of pre-established goals and may be paid in cash, stock or both. The Amended Plan generally provides for a three-year minimum vesting schedule on restricted stock awards that are not subject to performance-based criteria and no restricted stock awards may vest in less than one year.  Goal-based shares are subject to pre-established performance criteria and are not issued until the goals have been met.  With respect to stock options, the CGN Committee establishes the terms and conditions for each stock option; however, the Amended Plan sets the maximum term for stock options and SARs at eight years and does not permit the repricing of stock options without the prior approval of shareholders.  The Amended Plan prohibits the use of discounted stock options and SARs, except in certain merger or acquisition transactions.  When granting awards under the Amended Plan,  the CGN Committee may allow the awards to become fully exercisable or vested upon a Change of Control, as defined in the Amended Plan.  The awards will become vested only if a Change of Control actually occurs.
The Amended Plan provides for a fixed reserve of 36 million shares and does not provide for any annual increase of available shares.  Shares subject to an award under the Amended Plan that are forfeited or otherwise terminate unexercised without issuance will again be available for award.  Shares exchanged as payment of an option exercise or retained to satisfy withholding taxes are not added to shares available for awards.  Reload options are expressly prohibited.
Any material amendments to the Amended Plan require shareholder approval.
The description of the Amended Plan is a summary only and is qualified by reference to the Amended Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.

The Committee shall have the power and complete discretion, as provided in Section 16, to select eligible employees to receive Incentive Awards and to determine for each employee the nature of the award and the terms and conditions of each Incentive Award.

6.
Performance Grants
(a)           Each Performance Grant shall contain the Performance Goals for the award, including the Performance Criteria, the target and maximum amounts payable and any other terms and conditions as are applicable to the Performance Grant.  The terms of a Performance Grant may be set in an annual bonus plan or other similar document.  Each Performance Grant shall be granted and administered to comply with the requirements of Code section 162(m).  The aggregate maximum cash amount payable under the Plan to any Participant in any Plan Year shall not exceed 0.5% of Dominions consolidated operating income, before taxes and interest, as reported on its annual financial statements for the prior Plan Year.  In the event of any conflict between a Performance Grant and the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall govern.
(b)           The Committee shall establish the Performance Goals for Performance Grants.  The Committee shall determine the extent to which any Performance Criteria shall be used and weighted in determining Performance Grants.  The Committee may vary the Performance Criteria, Performance Goals and weightings from Participant to Participant, Performance Grant to Performance Grant and Plan Year to Plan Year.  The Committee may increase, but not decrease, any Performance Goal during a Plan Year.
(c)           The Committee shall establish for each Performance Grant the amount of cash or Company Stock payable at specified levels of performance, based on the Performance Goal for each Performance Criteria.  Any Performance Grant shall be made not later than 90 days after the start of the period for which the Performance Grant relates and shall be made prior to the completion of 25% of the period.  All determinations regarding the achievement of any Performance Goals will be made by the Committee.  The Committee may not increase during a Plan Year the amount of cash or Common Stock that would otherwise be payable upon achievement of the Performance Goal or Goals but may reduce or eliminate the payments as provided in a Performance Grant.
(d)           The actual payments to a Participant under a Performance Grant will be calculated by applying the achievement of a Performance Criteria to the Performance Goal as established in the Performance Grant.  All calculations of actual payments shall be made by the Committee and the Committee shall certify in writing the extent, if any, to which the Performance Goals have been met.
(e)           Performance Grants will be paid in cash, Company Stock or both, at the time or times as are provided in the Performance Grant.  A Performance Grant payable in cash may allow a Participant to elect to receive a payment in Company Stock that has a greater Fair Market Value than the cash award, and the Performance Grant may impose restrictions on the Company Stock issued under the election.
(f)           Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed in any way to limit or restrict any Employer or the Committee from making any award or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
(g)           A Participant who receives a Performance Grant payable in Company Stock shall have no rights as a shareholder until the Company Stock is issued pursuant to the terms of the Performance Grant.  The Company Stock may be issued without cash consideration.
(h)           A Participants interest in a Performance Grant may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered.
(i)           Whenever payments under a Performance Grant are to be made in cash, the Employer will withhold therefrom an amount sufficient to satisfy any Applicable Withholding Taxes.  Each Participant shall agree as a condition of receiving a Performance Grant payable in the form of Company Stock, to pay to the Employer, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Employer regarding the payment to the Employer of, Applicable Withholding Taxes.  Until the amount has been paid or arrangements satisfactory to the Employer have been made, no stock certificate shall be issued to the Participant.  As an alternative to making a cash payment to the Employer to satisfy Applicable Withholding Taxes, if the Performance Grant so provides, the Participant may elect to have the Employer retain that number of shares of Company Stock (valued at their Fair Market Value) that would satisfy all or a specified portion of the Applicable Withholding Taxes.
           .
7.
Restricted Stock Awards
(a)           The Committee may make grants of Restricted Stock to Participants.  Whenever the Committee deems it appropriate to grant Restricted Stock, notice shall be given to the Participant stating the number of shares of Restricted Stock granted and the terms and conditions to which the Restricted Stock is subject.  This notice shall be the Grant Agreement between the Employer and the Participant.  Restricted Stock may be awarded by the Committee in its discretion without cash consideration.
(b)           The Committee shall establish as to each award of Restricted Stock the terms and conditions upon which the restrictions set forth in paragraph (c) below shall lapse.  Restrictions conditioned on employment and the passage of time shall not expire less than three years from the Date of Grant of the Restricted Stock except that up to two million four hundred thousand 2,400,000 shares of Restricted Stock may be granted with a restriction of no less than one year.  Restrictions conditioned on the achievement of Performance Goals or other performance conditions shall not expire less than one year from the Date of Grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may in its discretion, and without limitation, provide that restrictions will expire as a result of the Disability, death or retirement of the Participant or the occurrence of a Change of Control.  The terms and conditions may include the achievement of a Performance Goal, which shall be governed by the provisions of Section 6 to the extent that the award is intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 162(m).
(c)           No shares of Restricted Stock may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of until the restrictions on the shares as set forth in the Participants Grant Agreement have lapsed or been removed.

Certificates representing Restricted Stock shall be held by Dominion until the restrictions lapse and upon request the Participant shall provide Dominion with appropriate stock powers endorsed in blank.
(e)           Each Participant shall agree at the time his or her Restricted Stock is granted, and as a condition thereof, to pay to the Employer, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Employer regarding the payment to the Employer of, Applicable Withholding Taxes.

As an alternative to making a cash payment to the Employer to satisfy Applicable Withholding Taxes, if the grant so provides, the Participant may elect to have the Employer retain that number of shares of Company Stock (valued at their Fair Market Value) that would satisfy all or a specified portion of the Applicable Withholding Taxes.
(f)           To the extent authorized by the Committee, a Participant may elect to not receive all or a portion of an annual cash incentive plan award and instead receive Restricted Stock in place of the designated cash award.  The Committee shall determine which cash incentive plan awards are eligible for this election.  The Committee may coordinate eligibility for the election with any share ownership guideline applicable to a Participant.  The following provisions shall apply if an election is made under this paragraph (f).
(i)           On the date the designated Incentive Award would otherwise be received, the Company shall issue Restricted Stock to the Participant in an amount equal to a pre-designated percentage of the designated Incentive Award.  The Restricted Stock will be valued based on the Fair Market Value of Company Stock.
(ii)           The restrictions on the Restricted Stock will lapse and the Restricted Stock will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the Restricted Stock.  The restrictions shall also lapse on the earlier of the Participant's death, disability or upon a Change of Control (or, if necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, a Qualifying Change of Control)..

A Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder until the Committee has certified that the performance objectives of the Goal-Based Stock award have been met and the Goal-Based Stock is issued.  Goal-Based Stock may be issued without cash consideration.
(d)           A Participants interest in a Goal-Based Stock award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered.
(e)           The Committee may at any time, in its sole discretion, remove or revise any and all performance criteria for an award of Goal-Based Stock.
(f)           Each Participant shall agree at the time of receiving an award of Goal-Based Stock, and as a condition thereof, to pay to the Employer, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Employer regarding the payment to the Employer of, Applicable Withholding Taxes.  Until the amount has been paid or arrangements satisfactory to the Employer have been made, no stock certificate shall be issued to the Participant.  As an alternative to making a cash payment to the Employer to satisfy Applicable Withholding Taxes, if the grant so provides, the Participant may elect to have the Employer retain that number of shares of Company Stock (valued at their Fair Market Value) that would satisfy all or a specified portion of the Applicable Withholding Taxes.

(i)           No Incentive Stock Option may be exercised after the first to occur of (x) eight years from the Date of Grant, (y) three months following the date of the Participants retirement or termination of employment with all Employers for reasons other than Disability or death, or (z) one year following the date of the Participants termination of employment on account of Disability or death.
 
(ii)           An Incentive Stock Option by its terms shall be exercisable in any calendar year only to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Date of Grant) of the Company Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during the calendar year does not exceed $100,000 (the Limitation Amount).  Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan and all other plans of any Employer shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Limitation Amount has been exceeded.  The Committee may impose any conditions as it deems appropriate on an Incentive Stock Option to ensure that the foregoing requirement is met.  If Incentive Stock Options that first become exercisable in a calendar year exceed the Limitation Amount, the excess Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options to the extent permitted by law.
 
(d)           No modification (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(B)) shall be made with respect to any Option if the modification would result in the Option constituting a deferral of compensation, and no extension (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(C)) shall be made with respect to any Option if the extension would result in the Option having an additional deferral feature from the Date of Grant, in each case without the Participants consent.
 
           .
10.
Stock Appreciation Rights
(a)           Whenever the Committee deems it appropriate, Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in connection with all or any part of an Option to a Participant or in a separate Incentive Award.  No Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised after the expiration of eight (8) years from the Date of Grant. Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection with an Option must have the same Date of Grant as the Option.
(b)           The following provisions apply to all Stock Appreciation Rights that are not granted in connection with Options:
(i)           Stock Appreciation Rights shall entitle the Participant, upon exercise of all or any part of the Stock Appreciation Rights, to receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Company Stock covered by the surrendered Stock Appreciation Right over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Company Stock on the Date of Grant of the Stock Appreciation Right.  The Committee may limit the amount that the Participant will be entitled to receive upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee may not revise or amend a Stock Appreciation Right to reduce the Fair Market Value of Company Stock on the Date of Grant, except as provided in Section 15.
(ii)           A Stock Appreciation Right may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value of the Company Stock covered by the Stock Appreciation Right exceeds the Fair Market Value of the Company Stock on the Date of Grant of the Stock Appreciation Right.
(c)           The following provisions apply to all Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted in connection with Options:
(i)           Stock Appreciation Rights shall entitle the Participant, upon exercise of all or any part of the Stock Appreciation Rights, to surrender to the Company unexercised that portion of the underlying Option relating to the same number of shares of Company Stock as is covered by the Stock Appreciation Rights (or the portion of the Stock Appreciation Rights so exercised) and to receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Company Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the underlying Option over (y) the exercise price of the Company Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the underlying Option.  The Committee may limit the amount that the Participant will be entitled to receive upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights.
(ii)           Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right and surrender of the related portion of the underlying Option, the Option, to the extent surrendered, shall not thereafter be exercisable.
(iii)           Subject to any further conditions upon exercise imposed by the Committee, a Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable and a Stock Appreciation Right shall expire no later than the date on which the related Option expires.
(iv)           The Stock Appreciation Right is only transferable when the related Options are otherwise transferable.
(v)           A Stock Appreciation Right may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market Value of the Company Stock covered by the Stock Appreciation Right exceeds the exercise price of the Company Stock covered by the underlying Option.
(d)           The manner in which the Companys obligation arising upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be paid shall be determined by the Committee and shall be set forth in the Incentive Award.  The Incentive Award may provide for payment in Company Stock or cash, or a fixed combination of Company Stock or cash, or the Committee may reserve the right to determine the manner of payment at the time the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.  Shares of Company Stock issued upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise.
(e)           No modification (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(B)) shall be made with respect to any Stock Appreciation Right if the modification would result in the Stock Appreciation Right constituting a deferral of compensation, and no extension (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(C)) shall be made with respect to any Stock Appreciation Right if the extension would result in the Stock Appreciation Right having an additional deferral feature from the Date of Grant, in each case without the Participants consent.
           .
11.
Method of Exercise of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
(a)           Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised by the Participant giving written notice of the exercise to the Employer, stating the number of shares the Participant has elected to purchase under the Option or the number of Stock Appreciation Rights the Participant has elected to exercise.  In the case of the purchase of shares under an Option, the notice shall be effective only if accompanied by the exercise price in full in cash; provided, however, that if the terms of an Option so permit, the Participant may (i) deliver a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Employer, from the sale or loan proceeds with respect to the sale of Company Stock or a loan secured by Company Stock, the amount necessary to pay the exercise price and, if required by the terms of the Option, Applicable Withholding Taxes, (ii) deliver Mature Shares (valued at their Fair Market Value) in satisfaction of all or any part of the exercise price, or (iii) use any other methods of payment as the Committee, at its discretion, deems appropriate.
(b)           Dominion may place on any certificate representing Company Stock issued upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right any legend deemed desirable by the Dominions counsel to comply with federal or state securities laws, and Dominion may require a customary written indication of the Participants investment intent.  Until the Participant has made any required payment, including any Applicable Withholding Taxes, and has had issued a certificate for the shares of Company Stock acquired, he or she shall possess no shareholder rights with respect to the shares.
(c)           Each Participant shall agree as a condition of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right to pay to the Employer, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Employer regarding the payment to the Employer of, Applicable Withholding Taxes.  Until the amount has been paid or arrangements satisfactory to the Employer have been made, no stock certificate shall be issued upon the exercise of an Option.
(d)           As an alternative to making a cash payment to the Employer to satisfy Applicable Withholding Taxes, if the Option or Stock Appreciation Rights agreement so provides, the Participant may elect to to have the Employer retain that number of shares of Company Stock (valued at their Fair Market Value) that would satisfy all or a specified portion of the Applicable Withholding Taxes.  The shares of Company Stock retained may not exceed the amount of the Applicable Withholding Taxes.
               Nonstatutory Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may be transferable by a Participant and exercisable by a person other than the Participant, but only to the extent specifically provided in the Incentive Award.  Incentive Stock Options, by their terms, shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable, during the Participants lifetime, only by the Participant.
12.
Transferability of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
              The original effective date of the Plan was May 1, 2005.  The effective date of this amendment to and restatement of the Plan shall be May 5, 2009, subject to approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Dominions shareholders.  Until (i) the Plan, as amended and restated herein, has been approved by Dominions shareholders, and (ii) the requirements of any applicable Federal or State securities laws have been met, no Restricted Stock or Goal-Based Stock shall be awarded on shares in excess of the shares already available for issuance under the Plan (without regard to this amendment and restatement), unless such grant is contingent on these events, and no Option granted with respect to shares in excess of the shares already available for issuance under the Plan (without regard to this amendment and restatement) shall be exercisable.
13.
Effective Date of the Plan.
              If not sooner terminated by the Dominion Board, the Plan, as amended and restated herein, shall terminate at the close of business on the date after the 2016 Annual Meeting of shareholders of Dominion.  No Incentive Awards shall be made under the Plan after its termination.  The Dominion Board may amend or terminate the Plan in any respects as it shall deem advisable; provided that, if and to the extent required by the Code, no change shall be made that increases the total number of shares of Company Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to Incentive Awards granted under the Plan (except pursuant to Section 15), materially modifies the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or materially increases the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, unless the change is authorized by the shareholders of Dominion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dominion Board may unilaterally amend the Plan and Incentive Awards with respect to Participants as it deems appropriate to ensure compliance with Rule 16b-3 or Code section 409A and to cause Incentive Stock Options and Performance Grants to meet the requirements of the Code and regulations thereunder.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, a termination or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the Participant, adversely affect a Participants rights under an Incentive Award previously granted to him or her.
14.
Termination, Modification, Change.
15.           Change in Capital Structure.
(a)           In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares, recapitalization or merger in which Dominion is the surviving corporation or other change in Dominions capital stock (including, but not limited to, the creation or issuance to shareholders generally of rights, options or warrants for the purchase of common stock or preferred stock of Dominion), the number and kind of shares of stock or securities of Dominion to be subject to the Plan and to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights then outstanding or to be granted thereunder, the maximum number of shares or securities which may be delivered under the Plan (including the maximum limit on Incentive Stock Options, Incentive Awards, Restricted Stock, Goal-Based Stock and Performance Grants under Section 4), the maximum number of shares or securities that can be granted to an individual Participant under Section 4, the exercise price of Options, the initial Fair Market Value of Company Stock under Stock Appreciation Rights, the terms of Incentive Awards and other relevant provisions shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination shall be binding on all persons.  If the adjustment would produce fractional shares with respect to any unexercised Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee may adjust appropriately the number of shares covered by the Option or Stock Appreciation Right so as to eliminate the fractional shares.
(b)           If Dominion is a party to a consolidation or a merger in which Dominion is not the surviving corporation, a transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of Dominions outstanding stock by a single person or entity, or a sale or transfer of substantially all of Dominions assets or if a Change of Control as defined in Section 2(d)(i) or (ii) otherwise occurs (a Corporate Event), then the Committee may take any actions with respect to outstanding Incentive Awards as the Committee deems appropriate; provided, however, the Committee may not accelerate the time or schedule of any payment of any Incentive Award that is subject to Code section 409A, or take any other action to cause such an award to violate Code section 409A, without the Participants consent.
(c)           Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may take the foregoing actions without the consent of any Participant, and the Committees determination shall be conclusive and binding on all persons for all purposes.
16.           Administration of the Plan.
(a)           The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  Subject to the express provisions and limitations set forth in this Plan, the Committee shall be authorized and empowered to do all things necessary or desirable, in its sole discretion, in connection with the administration of this Plan, including, without limitation, the following:
(i)           to prescribe, amend and rescind policies relating to this Plan, and to interpret the Plan, including defining terms not otherwise defined;
 
(ii)           to determine which persons will be Participants, to which of the Participants, if any, Incentive Awards shall be granted hereunder and the timing of any Incentive Awards;
 
(iii)          to grant Incentive Awards to Participants and determine the terms and conditions thereof, including the number of shares of Company Stock subject to Incentive Awards and the exercise or purchase price of the shares of Company Stock and the circumstances under which Incentive Awards become exercisable or vested or are forfeited or expire, which terms may but need not be conditioned upon the passage of time, continued employment, the satisfaction of Performance Goals, the occurrence of certain events, or other factors;
 
(iv)          to establish or verify the extent of satisfaction of any Performance Goals or other conditions applicable to the grant, issuance, exercisability, vesting and/or ability to retain any Incentive Award;
 
(v)           to prescribe and amend the terms of the award agreements or other documents evidencing Incentive Awards made under this Plan (which need not be identical);
 
(vi)          to determine whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 15;
 
(vii)         to interpret and construe this Plan, any policies under this Plan and the terms and conditions of any Incentive Award granted hereunder, and to make exceptions to any provisions for the benefit of the Company;
 
(viii)        to delegate any portion of its authority under the Plan to make Incentive Awards to an executive officer of Dominion, subject to any conditions that the Committee may establish, and
 
(ix)           to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Plan.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no tandem stock options (where two stock options are issued together and the exercise of one option affects the right to exercise the other option) may be issued in connection with Incentive Stock Options.  The Committee shall have the power to amend the terms of previously granted Incentive Awards that were granted by that Committee so long as the terms as amended are consistent with the terms of the Plan and provided that the consent of the Participant is obtained with respect to any amendment that would be detrimental to him or her, except that the consent will not be required if the amendment is for the purpose of complying with Rule 16b-3, Code section 409A or any other section or requirement of the Code applicable to the Incentive Award.
 
(b)           The interpretation and construction of any provision of the Plan by the Committee shall be final and conclusive as to any Participant.  The Committee may consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the Company, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel.
 
(c)           A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and all actions of the Committee shall be taken by a majority of the members present.  Any action may be taken by a written instrument signed by all of the members, and any action so taken shall be fully effective as if it had been taken at a meeting.
 
(d)           The Committee may delegate the administration of the Plan to an officer or officers of the Company, and the administrator(s) may have the authority to execute and distribute agreements or other documents evidencing or relating to Incentive Awards granted by the Committee under this Plan, to maintain records relating to the grant, vesting, exercise, forfeiture or expiration of Incentive Awards, to process or oversee the issuance of shares of Company Stock upon the exercise, vesting and/or settlement of an Incentive Award, to interpret the terms of Incentive Awards and to take any other actions as the Committee may specify, provided that in no case shall any administrator be authorized to grant Incentive Awards under the Plan.  Any action by an administrator within the scope of its delegation shall be deemed for all purposes to have been taken by the Committee and references in this Plan to the Committee shall include any administrator, provided that the actions and interpretations of any administrator shall be subject to review and approval, disapproval or modification by the Committee.
 
              All notices and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or mailed first class, postage prepaid, as follows (a) if to Dominionat the principal business address of Dominion to the attention of the Corporate Secretary of Dominion; and (b) if to any Participantat the last address of the Participant known to the sender at the time the notice or other communication is sent.
17.
Notice.
              The Plan is intended to operate in compliance with the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 16b-3 and to facilitate compliance with, and optimize the benefits from, Code section 162(m) and Code section 409A.  The terms of this Plan are subject to all present and future regulations and rulings of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States or his or her delegate relating to the qualification of Incentive Stock Options under the Code.  If any provision of the Plan conflicts with any such regulation or ruling, then that provision of the Plan shall be void and of no effect.  The terms of this Plan shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
18.
Interpretation.
           .   A Participant may designate a Beneficiary to receive benefits due under an Incentive Award, if any, upon the Participants death.  Designation of a Beneficiary shall be made by execution of a form approved or accepted by the administrator.  In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, a Participants surviving Spouse, if any, and if none, the Participants estate, shall be the Beneficiary.
19.
Beneficiary Matters
(a)           A Participant may change a prior Beneficiary designation made under Section 19 by a subsequent execution of a new Beneficiary designation form.  The change in Beneficiary will be effective upon receipt by the administrator.
(b)            Any payment made to a Beneficiary under this Plan by the administrator in good faith shall fully discharge the Company from all further obligations with respect to that payment.  If the administrator has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary to receive a payment under this Plan, the administrator shall have the right to withhold such payment until the matter is fully adjudicated.
(c)           In making any payment to or for the benefit of any minor or an incompetent Beneficiary, the administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may make a distribution to a legal or natural guardian or other relative of a minor or court-appointed representative of such incompetent.  Alternatively, it may make a payment to any adult with whom the minor or incompetent temporarily or permanently resides.  The receipt by a guardian, representative, relative or other person shall be a complete discharge of the Companys obligations under the Plan.  The Company shall have no responsibility to see to the proper application of any payment so made.
           With respect to any Incentive Award that provides for a deferral of compensation for purposes of Code section 409A and that is payable under its terms on a Participants  termination of employment (including a Participants termination of employment on account of retirement, if applicable), (i) any references herein and in the Participants Grant Agreement to the Participants termination of employment or date of termination of employment shall refer to the Participants Separation from Service or date of Separation from Service, as the case may be; and (ii) notwithstanding any provision herein or in the Participants Incentive Award to the contrary, if at the time of payment under such an Incentive Award, the Participant is a specified employee (as defined below), no such payment shall occur prior to the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of the Participants Separation from Service, or (B) the date of the Participants death.  Upon the expiration of the six (6)-month deferral period referred to in the preceding sentence or the Participants death, all amounts that would otherwise have been paid during such period but for this Section 20 shall be paid and any amounts that remain to be paid under the Award shall be paid in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Award Agreement.  The term specified employee shall have the same meaning as assigned to that term under Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and whether a Participant is a specified employee shall be determined in accordance with written guidelines adopted by Dominion for such purposes.
20.
Separation from Service.  
             With respect to any Award that provides for a deferral of compensation for purposes of Code section 409A and that is payable under its terms upon a Change of Control, or under which the time or form of payment of the Award varies depending on whether a Change of Control has occurred, any references herein and in the Participants Grant Agreement to a Change of Control or date of the Change of Control shall refer to a Qualifying Change of Control or the date of a Qualifying Change of Control, as the case may be.
21.
Qualifying Change of Control.
             If at any time on or after the effective date of this amended and restated Plan as described in Section 16 above, the Committee should determine that the issuance of any shares of Company Stock under an Incentive Award granted under the Plan, whether pursuant to the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise, would result in the violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws with respect to the Plan, then no shares of Company Stock shall be issued, and no Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercised, unless and until the Committee has determined that the issuance of such shares or the exercise of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights would not result in such violation.  If a Participants right to exercise an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is suspended pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Committee may provide that any time period to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right is extended or tolled during such period of suspension.
