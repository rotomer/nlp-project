Separately, the Company has agreed to enter into a Replacement Capital Covenant under which the Company promises and covenants to and for the benefit of designated covered debtholders (as may be designated from time to time, with the initially designated covered debt and the initial covered debtholders being the Company's Series B 7.0% Senior Notes due 2038 issued by the Company on June 17, 2008 and the holders thereof) that the Company shall not redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, "defease" or "a defeasance") all or any part of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and shall cause its majority owned subsidiaries not to purchase all or any part of the Junior Subordinated Notes, on or before June 15, 2034 (which date will be automatically extended as set forth in the Replacement Capital Covenant for additional quarterly periods to no later than June 15, 2049, if and to the extent that the maturity date of the Junior Subordinated Notes is extended), unless, subject to certain limitations, during the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance the Company has received a specified amount of proceeds as set forth in the Replacement Capital Covenant from the sale of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like then, the applicable characteristics of the Junior Subordinated Notes at that time, as more fully described in the Replacement Capital Covenant.

Representations and Warranties of the Company

At or before 1:50 p.m. on the date hereof (the Time of Sale), the Company had prepared the following information in connection with the offering (collectively, the Time of Sale Information): the Base Prospectus dated January 29, 2009, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet (as defined in Section 6(a)) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Section 3A(c)) listed on Schedule VI hereto. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, each document included in the Time of Sale Information shall be deemed to include all documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) incorporated therein by reference, whether any such Incorporated Document is filed before or after the document into which it is incorporated, so long as the Incorporated Document is filed before the Time of Sale.
(b) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or otherwise preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust Indenture Act), and the rules, regulations and releases of the Commission under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act (the Rules and Regulations); neither the Registration Statement on any date on which it has been deemed to have become effective (the Effective Date), the Prospectus as of its date nor the Time of Sale Information at the Time of Sale contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and, on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules

(c) Other than the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the documents listed on Schedule VI, the Prospectus, or any document not constituting a prospectus under Section 2(a)(10)(a) of the Securities Act or Rule 134 under the Securities Act, the Company (including its agents and representatives, other than the Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not made, used, prepared, authorized, approved or referred to and will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to, any "written communication" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Junior Subordinated Notes, unless such written communication is approved in writing in advance by the Representatives. To the extent any such written communication constitutes an "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act and referred to herein as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus complied or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 433(c) and, if the filing thereof is required pursuant to Rule 433, such filing has been or will be made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d).

(d) If, at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, the Company (i) has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Underwriters through the Representatives of such conflict and, (ii) at its expense, has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict; provided, that the foregoing representations and warranties in this Section 3A(d) shall not
 
apply to conflicts arising from statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by the Underwriters or on the Underwriters' behalf through the Representatives for use in such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole have no material contingent financial obligation which is not disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
(f) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who has audited certain of the Company's financial statements filed with the Commission and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, is an independent registered public accounting firm as required by the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations.

All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary that is a corporation has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable, and, with the exception of the outstanding preferred stock of Virginia Electric and Power Company which is owned by third parties, the capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary that is a corporation is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, claim, encumbrance or equitable right. With respect to the Significant Subsidiary that is a limited liability company, the membership interests of such Significant Subsidiary are owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, claim, encumbrance or equitable right.

and compliance by the Company with its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Notes do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary is subject (except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not have a Material Adverse Effect), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any subsidiary, or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or operations, and the Company has full power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Junior Subordinated Notes as contemplated by this Agreement.
(i) The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, will not be, an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it may use a free writing prospectus that is (i) the Final Term Sheet; (ii) an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Schedule VI or otherwise approved in writing in advance by the Representatives pursuant to Section 3A(c) above or (iii) one or more term sheets relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes that do not contain substantive changes from or additions to the Final Term Sheet.

The hour and date of such delivery and payment are herein called the "Closing Date."

6. . The Company agrees that:
Covenants of the Company
(a) The Company will file the final Prospectus with the Commission within the time periods specified by Rule 424(b) and Rule 430B under the Securities Act; will prepare a final term sheet, substantially in the form of Schedule VI hereto (the Final Term Sheet) and file such Final Term Sheet in compliance with Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act; will file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Securities Act; and will file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the date of the Prospectus and within the Prospectus Delivery Period. The Company will pay the registration fees for this offering within the time period required by Rule 456(b)(i) under the Securities Act and, in any event, prior to the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date.
 
(b) If the Representatives so request, the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, or any Additional Closing Date, as applicable, will deliver to the Representatives conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed, including all exhibits, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to each such document, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested by the Representatives, provided however that if any of the foregoing documents are delivered prior to the Closing Date, such documents need not be provided prior to any Additional Closing Date.

(c) The Company will pay all expenses in connection with (i) the preparation and filing by it of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes, (iii) any fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee and the Series Trustee and (iv) the printing and delivery (by first class mail) to the Underwriters, in reasonable quantities, of copies of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus (each as originally filed and as subsequently amended).

(d) If, during the time when a prospectus relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs as a result of which (i) the Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (ii) it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act, the Company promptly will (y) notify the Underwriters through the Representatives to suspend solicitation of purchases of the Junior Subordinated Notes and, (z) at its expense, prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance. During the period specified above, the Company will continue to prepare and file with the Commission on a timely basis all documents or amendments required under the Securities Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; provided, that the Company shall not file such documents or amendments without also furnishing copies thereof to the Representatives and Troutman Sanders LLP. Any such documents or amendments which
 
are electronically available through EDGAR shall be deemed to have been furnished by the Company to the Representatives and Troutman Sanders LLP.
(e) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement prior to filing; and the Company will also advise the Representatives promptly of the filing of any such amendment or supplement, of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof, or of receipt from the Commission of any notice of objection to the use of the Registration Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or any such notice of objection and to obtain as soon as possible their lifting, if issued.
(f) The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon as it is practicable to do so, an earnings statement of the Company (in reasonable detail, in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 under the Securities Act and which need not be audited), covering a period of at least 12 months beginning within three months after the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158 under the Securities Act) of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
(g) The Company will furnish such information as may be lawfully required for, and otherwise cooperate in, qualifying the Junior Subordinated Notes for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in any state to qualify as a foreign corporation, or to file a general consent to service of process, or to submit to any requirements which it deems unduly burdensome.
(h) Fees and disbursements of Troutman Sanders LLP, who is acting as counsel for the Underwriters, (exclusive of fees and disbursements of Troutman Sanders LLP which are to be paid as set forth in Section 6(c)) shall be paid by the Underwriters; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions of Sections 7 or 8 hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Representatives for the account of the Underwriters for the amount of such fees and disbursements.
(i) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing to and including the later of (i) 30 days after the date of this Agreement or (ii) 30 days after any election to exercise the Over-Allotment Option, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, sell or offer to sell or otherwise dispose of any Junior Subordinated Notes or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Junior Subordinated Notes or any debt securities substantially similar to Junior Subordinated Notes (except for the Junior Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to this Agreement).
 
(j) The Company will use best efforts to list the Junior Subordinated Notes on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The Representatives shall have received, prior to payment for the Junior Subordinated Notes, a certificate dated the Closing Date, and if applicable, any Additional Closing Date and signed by the President or any Vice President of the Company to the effect that no such stop order is in effect and that no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission.
(ii) On the Closing Date, and if applicable, any Additional Closing Date, the Representatives shall receive, on behalf of the several Underwriters, the opinions of Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, McGuireWoods LLP, counsel to the Company, and the Company's General Counsel, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Schedules III, IV and V, respectively. In lieu of any such opinion to be delivered on an Additional Closing Date, such counsel may furnish the Representatives, on behalf of the several Underwriters, with a letter to the effect that they may rely upon the opinion delivered on the Closing Date by such counsel to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter authorizing reliance.
(iii) The Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP on the date of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, and if applicable, any Additional Closing Date, letters addressed to the Representatives containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' SAS 72 "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, including any pro forma financial information.
(iv) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, if applicable, (A) except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (exclusive of amendments or supplements after the date hereof), there shall not have occurred (1) any change in the debt securities of the Company of the same class as the Junior Subordinated Notes or any class senior to the Junior Subordinated Notes (other than a decrease in the aggregate
 
principal amount thereof outstanding or issuances of commercial paper in the ordinary course of business), (2) any material adverse change in the general affairs, financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (3) any material transaction entered into by the Company other than a transaction in the ordinary course of business, the effect of which in each such case in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is so material and so adverse that it makes it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement, and (B) there shall not have occurred (1) a downgrading in the rating accorded the debt securities of the Company of the same class as the Junior Subordinated Notes or any class senior to the Junior Subordinated Notes, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act) and no such organization shall have given any notice of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change with possible negative implications in its ratings of such securities, (2) any general suspension of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or any limitation on prices for such trading or any restrictions on the distribution of securities established by the New York Stock Exchange or by the Commission or by any federal or state agency or by the decision of any court, (3) a suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (4) a banking moratorium declared either by federal or New York State authorities or (5) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or crisis resulting in the declaration of a national emergency, or any material adverse change in the financial markets; provided the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, crisis or material adverse change shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement.
(v) On the Closing Date, and if applicable, any Additional Closing Date, the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be true and correct as if made on and as of such date, and the Company shall have performed all obligations and satisfied all conditions required of it under this Agreement; and, on the Closing Date, and if applicable, any Additional Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received a certificate to such effect signed by the President or any Vice President of the Company.
(vi) All legal proceedings to be taken in connection with the issuance and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall have been satisfactory in form and substance to Troutman Sanders LLP.
(vii) The Company shall have applied for listing of the Junior Subordinated Notes on the NYSE.
 
(b) In case any of the conditions specified above in Section 7(a) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives upon mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however, that in case the conditions specified in subsections 7(a)(v) and (vi) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may not be so terminated by the Representatives unless Underwriters who have agreed to purchase in the aggregate 50% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall have consented to such termination and the aforesaid notice shall so state. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 7(c) and 9 hereof.
(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (in addition to the fees and disbursements of their outside counsel as provided in Section 6(h)) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder and, upon such reimbursement, the Company shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 6(c) and 9.
8. . The obligation of the Company to deliver the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 7(a)(i) and in Section 7(a)(ii). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Representatives. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 9 and 10 hereof.
Conditions of the Obligation of the Company
9. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each such Underwriter, director, officer, and controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used on or prior to the date hereof), the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements
 
thereto shall have been furnished), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, in any Preliminary Prospectus or in the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 9(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the Time of Sale Information or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to either thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the respective Underwriters contained in this Section 9(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(c) The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that, upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company, or against such Underwriter or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom
 
indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; provided that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
 
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
10. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes, then the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so fail or refuse to purchase Junior Subordinated Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Junior Subordinated Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter (except as provided in Sections 6(h) and 9) or of the Company (except as provided in Sections 6(c) and 9). In any such case not involving a termination, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or, if applicable, any Additional Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action
Termination
 
taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
12. . The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company, the Underwriters and, with respect to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each controlling person and each officer and director of the Company and the Underwriters referred to in Section 9, and their respective successors, assigns, executors and administrators. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. The term "successors" as used in this Agreement shall not include any purchaser, as such, of any of the Junior Subordinated Notes from any of the several Underwriters. The Company and the Underwriters each acknowledge and agree that in connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Underwriters have an arms length business relationship that creates no fiduciary duty on the part of either party and each expressly disclaims any fiduciary relationship, except that the Underwriters acknowledge that they owe a duty of trust or confidence to the Company as contemplated by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 100 (17 CFR 243.100) of Regulation FD under the Securities Exchange Act.
Miscellaneous
13. . All communications hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to the Representatives at the address set forth on Schedule II hereto, or if to the Company shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to it, attention of Treasurer, Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 (facsimile number: (804) 819-2211).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the arrangements for issuance by Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company) of up to U.S. $625,000,000 (subject to an increase of up to $62,500,000 upon exercise of the Over-Allotment Option) aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Series A 8.375% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the Junior Subordinated Notes) and the offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes by you pursuant to an Underwriting
 
Agreement dated June 10, 2009 by and between you and the Company (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals or copies certified to our satisfaction of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, the Indenture Trustee and the Series Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Indenture Trustee and the Series Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
In addition, we attended the closing held today at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement that are required to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.
Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
2. No approval or consent by any public regulatory body is legally required in connection with the sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement (except to the extent that compliance with the provisions of securities or blue sky laws of certain states may be required in connection with the sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes in such states) and the carrying out of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
5. The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when completed and authenticated by the Series Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in
 
the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
6. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-157013) with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Junior Subordinated Notes in the manner therein specified.
7. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except that we express no comment or belief with respect to any historical or pro forma financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
8. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES, as supplemented by the statements under SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, and the statements relating to the Replacement Capital Covenant contained under CERTAIN TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, are substantially accurate and fair.
9. With regard to the discussion in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, under the caption CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering the aforementioned opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
We have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration
 
Statement (which includes statistical statements in the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraphs 8 and 9 in regard to the statements described in such paragraphs 8 and 9. We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus as it was initially issued and as it has been supplemented or amended, and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Underwriting Agreement. None of the foregoing participation, review or attendance disclosed to us any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, or the Prospectus contained on its date or the date it was supplemented or amended, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto, and the Statement of Eligibility of the Indenture Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (or, with respect to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, now omits) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1)  (9) above and in making the statements expressed in the preceding paragraph, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
TROUTMAN SANDERS LLP

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of up to U.S. $625,000,000(subject to an increase of up to $62,500,000 upon exercise of the Over-Allotment Option) aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Series A 8.375% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the Junior Subordinated Notes) and pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated
 
 
June 10, 2009, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company, the Indenture Trustee and the Series Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Indenture Trustee and the Series Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
On this basis we are of the opinion that:
1. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement or the due execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
2. The Indenture has been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
3. The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when completed and authenticated by the Series Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is in a proceeding in equity or at law).
4. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-157013) with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration
 
statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Junior Subordinated Notes in the manner therein specified.
5. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
6. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES, as supplemented by the statements under SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, and the statements relating to the Replacement Capital Covenant contained under CERTAIN TERMS OF THE REPLACEMENT CAPITAL COVENANT in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, are substantially accurate and fair.
7. With regard to the discussion in the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009, under the caption CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS, subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, we are of the opinion that under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion does not purport to disclose all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes, such discussion constitutes an accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering the aforementioned opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus were discussed, and we have consulted with officers and other employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. We have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which our investigation led us to deem pertinent. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement. We have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which our investigation did not lead us to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We
 
accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraphs 6 and 7 in regard to the statements described in such paragraphs 6 and 7. But such conferences, consultation, examination and attendance disclosed to us no information with respect to such other matters that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, the Prospectus contained as of its date, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules and other financial information and the Statement of Eligibility of the Indenture Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such date or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is provided on the basis that, except as otherwise provided in Section 3A(a) of the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Time of Sale Information, any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
MCGUIREWOODS LLP

(the Company), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated June 10, 2009, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement), have been taken under my supervision as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
As Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, I have general responsibility over the attorneys within the Company's Legal Department responsible for rendering legal counsel to the Company regarding corporate, financial, securities and other matters. I am generally familiar with the organization, business and affairs of the Company. I am also familiar with the proceedings taken and proposed to be taken by the Company in connection with the offering and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of the law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, I have responsibility for supervising lawyers who may have been asked by me or others to review legal matters arising in connection with the offering and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Accordingly, some of the matters referred to herein have not been handled personally by me, but I have been made familiar with the facts and circumstances and the applicable law, and the opinions herein expressed are my own or are opinions of others in which I concur.
 
On this basis I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the respective laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
4. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' properties is subject other than any proceedings described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
I am a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Virginia and I do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent. I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein resulting from matters that may hereinafter arise or that may hereinafter be brought to my attention.

The final maturity date of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be no later than June 15, 2079, on which date the entire principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes will become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall mean the maturity date of the Junior Subordinated Notes as extended in accordance with this Section 3.2, which may not be otherwise shortened or extended.
3.2 Maturity.
 
With respect to each extension beginning on June 15, 2019, the following shall constitute the extension conditions:

Principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable, the transfer of such Junior Subordinated Notes will be registrable and such Junior Subordinated Notes will be exchangeable for Junior Subordinated Notes bearing identical terms and provisions at the Corporate Trust Office of the Series Trustee; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at such address as shall appear in the Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Paying Agent by the Record Date. The Register for the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Series Trustee, and the Series Trustee is hereby appointed registrar and Paying Agent for the Junior Subordinated Notes.
(b) The Junior Subordinated Notes may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes in a denomination of less than $25 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever. Any such transferee shall be deemed not to be the holder of such Junior Subordinated Notes for any purpose, including but not limited to the receipt of payments in respect of such Junior Subordinated Notes and such transferee shall be deemed to have no interest whatsoever in such Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
The Junior Subordinated Notes will be issued to the holders in accordance with the following procedures:
3.4 Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Junior Subordinated Notes; Restrictions on Transfers; Depositary.
(a) So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are eligible for book-entry settlement with the Depositary, or unless required by law, all Junior Subordinated Notes that are so eligible will be represented by one or more Junior Subordinated Notes in global form (a "Global Note") registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. Except as provided in Section 3.4(c) below, beneficial owners of a Global Note shall not be entitled to have Definitive Note Certificates registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Definitive Note Certificates and will not be registered holders of such Global Notes.
(b) The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in Global Notes shall be effected through the Depositary in accordance with the Indenture and the procedures and standing instructions of the Depositary and the Series Trustee shall make appropriate endorsements to reflect increases or decreases in principal amounts of such Global Notes.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in this Section 3.4(c)), a Global Note may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Junior Subordinated Notes registered, and no transfer of a Global Note may be registered, in the name of any person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof unless (i) such Depositary (A) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Note or (B) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act and no successor Depositary has been appointed by the Company within 90 days after its receipt of such notice or its becoming aware of such ineligibility, (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, or any event which after notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default under the Indenture, with respect to such Junior Subordinated Note, or (iii) the Company, in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary, instructs the Series Trustee to exchange such Global Note for a Junior Subordinated Note that is not a Global Note (in which case such exchange (subject to such procedures) shall be effected by the Series Trustee).
The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes. Initially, the Global Notes shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited with the Series Trustee as custodian for Cede & Co.
Definitive Note Certificates issued in exchange for all or a part of a Global Note pursuant to this Section 3.4(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Series Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Series Trustee shall deliver such Definitive Note Certificates to the person in whose names such Definitive Note Certificates are so registered.
 
So long as Junior Subordinated Notes are represented by one or more Global Notes, (i) the registrar for the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Series Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the clearing agency for all purposes of the Indenture relating to such Global Notes as the sole holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes evidenced by such Global Notes and shall have no obligations to the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes; and (ii) the rights of the holders of beneficial interests in such Global Notes shall be exercised only through the clearing agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such holders and the clearing agency and/or the participants in the clearing agency.
At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been paid, redeemed, exchanged, repurchased or canceled, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Series Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for Definitive Note Certificates, redeemed by the Company pursuant to Article III or canceled, or transferred for part of a Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions of the Depositary be reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note by, or at the direction of, the Series Trustee to reflect such reduction or increase.
3.5 Interest.
(a) Each Junior Subordinated Note will bear interest at the rate of 8.375% per annum from the Original Issue Date. Subject to the Company's right to defer interest payments described in Article V below, interest is payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the annual rate of 8.375% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable will be paid to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered, at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for, and that is not deferred pursuant to Article V hereof, will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holders on such Record Date and may either be paid (i) to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note (or any Junior Subordinated Note issued upon registration of transfer or exchange thereof) is registered at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Base Indenture or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which the Junior Subordinated Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. The "Record Date" for payment of interest will be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless such Junior Subordinated Note is registered to a holder other than the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
(b) If an Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and
 
principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable.
An Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes provided that the nonpayment of interest for so long as and to the extent that interest is permitted to be deferred pursuant to Article V herein shall not be deemed to be a default in the payment of interest for the purposes of Article VI of the Base Indenture and shall not otherwise be deemed an Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Series Trustee or the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be an Event of Default except those that are specifically identified as an Event of Default under the Indenture.
3.6 Events of Default.
The Company shall have the option to redeem the Junior Subordinated Notes:
4.1 Optional Redemption by Company.
(a) in whole or in part at any time before June 15, 2014 at a redemption price equal to the Make-Whole Amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date;
(b) in whole or in part at any time before June 15, 2014, if a Rating Agency Event occurs, at a redemption price equal to the Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date;
(c) in whole, but not in part, at any time before June 15, 2014, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinate Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date; and
(d) in whole or in part at any time on or after June 15, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but not including, the redemption date.
The applicable redemption price shall be paid prior to 2:30 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such redemption, provided that the Company shall deposit with the Series Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such redemption price is to be paid. The Company will notify the Series Trustee of the amount of any applicable Make-Whole Amount or Rating Agency Event Make-Whole Amount promptly after the calculation thereof, and the Series Trustee will not be responsible for such calculation.
Subject to Article III of the Base Indenture, notice of any redemption pursuant to this Article III will be mailed at least 20 days but not more than 60 days
4.2 Notice of Redemption.
 
before the redemption date to each holder of Junior Subordinated Notes to be redeemed at such holder's registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the applicable redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest shall cease to accrue on such Junior Subordinated Notes called for redemption.
So long as there is no Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes under the Base Indenture, the Company, at its option, may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of interest payments may not end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date any may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period. Such accrued interest shall be payable to the persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
5.1 Option to Defer Interest Payments.
Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to 8.375% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any additional interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes and is not deferring any interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes at such time, it will not and its Subsidiaries shall not do any of the following:
 
 
 
However, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making:
(a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
 
(b) any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clause (i) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
(c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
(d) dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
(e) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or
(f) payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, any trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, junior subordinated debentures or junior subordinated notes, or any guarantees of any of the foregoing, in each case that rank equal in right of payment to the Junior Subordinated Notes, so long as the amount of payments made on account of such securities or guarantees is paid on all such securities and guarantees then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of such securities and guarantees is then entitled if paid in full.
The Company shall give the Series Trustee written notice of its election to begin a deferral period at least one Business Day before the Record Date for the next Interest Payment Date. The Series Trustee will forward any written notice that the Company gives of its election to begin a deferral period to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. However, the Company's failure to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of a deferral period unless the Company pays such interest payment within five Business Days after the Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral.
5.2 Notice of Deferral.
 
The Junior Subordinated Notes and the Series Trustee's Certificate of Authentication to be endorsed thereon are to be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
6.1 Form of Junior Subordinated Note.

The Original Trustee and the Series Trustee shall not constitute co-trustees of the same trust, and each of the Original Trustee and the Series Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under the Indenture separate and apart from any trust or trusts under the Indenture administered by the other trustee.

DOMINION RESOURCES, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (herein referred to as the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Holder named above, the principal sum [of              Dollars]**[specified in the Schedule annexed hereto]*** on the date of Stated Maturity, as hereafter defined, and to pay (subject to deferral as set forth herein) interest thereon at the rate of 8.375% per annum, such interest to accrue from June 17, 2009. Subject to the Company's right to defer interest payments described herein, interest is payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing on September 15, 2009 (the "Interest Payment Dates"), until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the annual rate of 8.375% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
The maturity date of this note (this "Note") initially will be June 15, 2064, but will be automatically extended, except for any portion of the principal amount of this Note that shall have been earlier redeemed or with respect to which notice of redemption shall have been given to the Holder hereof, for additional quarterly periods on each of March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, beginning on June 15, 2014 through and including March 15, 2019, without notice to, or consent of, the Holder of this Note. Subject to the conditions described below, the maturity date will be further automatically extended for additional quarterly periods beginning on June 15, 2019 through and including March 15, 2029, except for any portion of the principal amount of this Note that shall have been earlier redeemed or with respect to which notice of redemption shall have been given to the Holder hereof. The final maturity date of this Note will be no later than June 15, 2079, on which date the entire principal amount of this Note
 
 
will become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The Stated Maturity of this Note shall mean the maturity date of this Note as extended in accordance with this paragraph, and may not be otherwise shortened or extended.
With respect to each extension beginning on June 15, 2019, the following shall constitute the extension conditions:
(a) On the applicable extension date the ratings on the Junior Subordinated Notes satisfy at least two of the three following ratings criteria: (i) at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), (ii) at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("Standard & Poor's") and (iii) at least BBB- by Fitch Ratings Ltd ("Fitch"), or, if Moody's, Standard & Poor's and/or Fitch (or their respective successors) are no longer in existence, the equivalent rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; and
(b) During the three years prior to the applicable extension date:
(i) no event of default has occurred in respect of any of the Company's then outstanding indebtedness for money borrowed; and
(ii) the Company did not have (and does not have at the extension date) any outstanding deferred payments under any of its then-outstanding preferred stock or debt securities.
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable on an Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered, at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for, and that is not deferred as described below, will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Record Date and may either be paid (i) to the Person in whose name this Note (or any Junior Subordinated Note issued upon registration of transfer or exchange thereof) is registered at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Base Indenture or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which the Junior Subordinated Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. The "Record Date" for payment of interest will be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, unless this Note is registered to a holder other than the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary, in which case the Record Date for payment of interest will be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day.
If an Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date, redemption date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable.
 
This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest at the office of the Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company (i) by check mailed to such address of the person entitled thereto as the address shall appear on the Register of the Notes or (ii) by transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Register, provided that proper transfer instructions have been received by the Record Date. Payment of the principal and interest on this Note shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
So long as there is no Event of Default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes under the Base Indenture, the Company, at its option, may, on one or more occasions, defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on the Junior Subordinated Notes for a period of up to 10 consecutive years (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an "Optional Deferral Period"). A deferral of interest payments may not end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date and may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period and may not pay current interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period. Such accrued interest shall be payable to the persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
Any deferred interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to 8.375% per annum, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any additional interest accrued on the deferred interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes as described above, but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
Unless the Company has paid all accrued and payable interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes and is not deferring any interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes at such time, it will not and its Subsidiaries shall not do any of the following:
(i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment on any of Dominion Resources, Inc's capital stock;
(ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any of its debt securities that rank on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes (including debt securities of other series issued under the Base Indenture); or
(iii) make any guarantee payments on any guarantee of debt securities if the guarantee ranks on a parity with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes.
 
However, the foregoing provisions shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making:
(a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of its capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire its capital stock;
(b) any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of dividend described in clause (i) above as a result of a reclassification of its capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of its capital stock for another class or series of its capital stock;
(c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of its capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of its capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
(d) dividends or distributions paid or made in its capital stock (or rights to acquire its capital stock), or repurchases, redemptions or acquisitions of capital stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of capital stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred;
(e) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of, or with respect to, any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; or
(f) payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, any trust preferred securities, subordinated debentures, junior subordinated debentures or junior subordinated notes, or any guarantees of any of the foregoing, in each case that rank equal in right of payment to the Junior Subordinated Notes, so long as the amount of payments made on account of such securities or guarantees is paid on all such securities and guarantees then outstanding on a pro rata basis in proportion to the full payment to which each series of such securities and guarantees is then entitled if paid in full.
The Company shall give the Series Trustee written notice of its election to begin a deferral period at least one Business Day before the Record Date for the next Interest Payment Date. The Series Trustee will forward any written notice that the Company gives of its election to begin a deferral period to the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes. However, the Company's failure to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of a deferral period unless the Company pays such interest payment within five Business Days after the Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral.
 
The Notes of this series shall have an initial aggregate principal amount of up to Six Hundred Eighty Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($687,500,000).
The Notes evidenced by this Certificate may be transferred or exchanged only in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof, and any attempted transfer, sale or other disposition of Notes in a denomination of less than $25 shall be deemed to be void and of no legal effect whatsoever.
The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Note, including the principal hereof and interest hereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to Holders of Priority Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Note, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture.

D.

the Corporation hereby covenants and agrees as follows in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder.
NOW, THEREFORE,
SECTION 1. . Capitalized terms used in this Replacement Capital Covenant (including the Recitals) have the meanings set forth in Schedule I hereto.
Definitions

(i) the Corporation shall identify each series of its then outstanding long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is Eligible Debt;
(ii) if only one series of the Corporation's then outstanding long-term indebtedness for money borrowed is Eligible Debt, such series shall become the Covered Debt commencing on the related Redesignation Date;
(iii) if the Corporation has more than one outstanding series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is Eligible Debt, then the Corporation shall identify a specific series that has the latest stated final maturity date as of the date on which the Corporation is applying the procedures in this Section 3(b) and such series shall become the Covered Debt commencing on the related Redesignation Date;
 
(iv) the series of outstanding long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is determined to be the Covered Debt pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above shall be the Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for the period commencing on the related Redesignation Date and continuing to but not including the Redesignation Date as of which a new series of outstanding long-term indebtedness is next determined to be the Covered Debt pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 3(b); and
(v) in connection with such identification of a new series of the Covered Debt, notice shall be given, and a Form 8-K shall be filed, as provided for in Section 3(d) within the time frame provided for in such section.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Replacement Capital Covenant, (i) if a series of Eligible Senior Debt of the Corporation has become the Covered Debt in accordance with Section 3(b), on the date on which the Corporation issues a new series of Eligible Subordinated Debt, then immediately upon such issuance such series shall become the Covered Debt and the applicable series of Eligible Senior Debt shall cease to be the Covered Debt.
(d) In order to give effect to the intent of the Corporation described in Recital C, the Corporation covenants that (i) simultaneously with the execution of this Replacement Capital Covenant, or as soon as practicable after the date hereof, (A) notice shall be given to the Holders of the Initial Covered Debt, in the manner provided in the indenture or other instrument under which such Initial Covered Debt was issued, of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the rights granted to such Holders hereunder and (B) the Corporation shall file a copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant with the Commission as an exhibit to a Form 8-K; (ii) so long as the Corporation is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, the Corporation will include or cause to be included in each Form 10-K filed with the Commission by the Corporation a description of the covenant set forth in Section 2 and identify the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Covered Debt as of the date such Form 10-K is filed with the Commission; (iii) if a series of the Corporation's long-term indebtedness for money borrowed (A) becomes Covered Debt or (B) ceases to be Covered Debt, notice of such occurrence will be given within 30 days to the holders of such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed was issued and the Corporation shall report such change in a Form 8-K, which must include or incorporate by reference this Replacement Capital Covenant, and, if reported in a Form 8-K, also in the next Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as applicable, of the Corporation; (iv) if, and only if, the Corporation ceases to be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, the Corporation will (A) post on its website the information otherwise required to be included in Securities Exchange Act filings pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) above; and (B) cause a notice of this Replacement Capital Covenant to be posted on the Bloomberg screen for the Initial Covered Debt or any successor Bloomberg screen or, if none, a similar third-party vendor's screen the Corporation reasonably believes is appropriate (each an "Investor Screen") and cause a hyperlink of this Replacement Capital Covenant to be included on the Investor Screen for each series of the Covered Debt, in each case to the extent permitted by Bloomberg or such similar third-party vendor, as the case may be; and (v) promptly upon the request of any Holder of Covered Debt, the Corporation will provide such Holder with an executed copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant.
SECTION 4. .
Termination and Amendment
(a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "Termination Date") to occur of (i) (x) June 15, 2034 or (y) if the maturity date of the Notes shall be extended in accordance with the Third Supplemental and Amending Indenture, the date which is 30 years prior to the maturity
 
date, as extended, or if earlier, the date on which the Notes are otherwise paid, redeemed, defeased or purchased in full (in compliance with the terms of Section 2 of this Replacement Capital Covenant), (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the then effective Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (iii) the date on which the Corporation ceases to have any Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (ii) of the definition of each such term), or (iv) the date on which the Notes are accelerated as a result of a default thereunder. From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect with respect to the Holders, or otherwise.
(b) This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation after obtaining the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the then-effective Covered Debt; provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders) if any of the following apply: (i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities, if, in the case of this clause, after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that, or the Corporation has been otherwise advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that, there is more than an insubstantial risk that failure to eliminate Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States or International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") if then applicable to the Corporation; (ii) the sole effect of such amendment or supplement is either (A) to impose additional restrictions on the ability of (1) the Corporation to redeem, purchase or defease Notes or (2) any majority-owned Subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase Notes, or (B) to impose additional restrictions on, or to eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities (other than securities which are covered by clause (i) above) and in each case an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such Covered Debt was issued a written certificate to that effect; (iii) such amendment or supplement extends the date specified in Section 4(a)(i), the Stepdown Date or both; or (iv) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such Covered Debt was issued a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt. For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Replacement Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Replacement Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Holders of the Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy the definition of Explicit Replacement Covenant.
(c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement this Replacement Capital Covenant or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall be the Holders of the then effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
 
SECTION 5.
. Miscellaneous
(a)
This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
(b) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation (and its successors and assigns) and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates a claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Person's rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt). The Corporation agrees that, if at any time the Covered Debt is held by a trust (for example, where the Covered Debt is part of an issuance of trust preferred securities), a holder of the securities issued by such trust may enforce (including by instituting legal proceedings) this Replacement Capital Covenant directly against the Corporation as though such holder owned the Covered Debt directly, and the holders of such trust securities shall be deemed Holders of the Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for so long as the indebtedness held by such trust remains the Covered Debt hereunder. Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the two previous sentences, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant. In particular, no holder of the Notes is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Base Indenture.
(c) The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants.
(d) All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), or (iii) if sent by telecopier, on the day telecopied, or if not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, provided that the telecopy is promptly confirmed by telephone confirmation thereof, and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the Corporation may thereafter post on its website as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant:

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 
Schedule I
means, with respect to any Qualifying Capital Securities, provisions in the related transaction documents that permit the issuer, in its sole discretion, to defer Distributions in whole or in part on such Qualifying Capital Securities for one or more consecutive Distribution Periods of up to ten years and that require the issuer thereof to issue (or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue), in its sole discretion, one or more types of APM Qualifying Securities raising "eligible proceeds" (as defined in (a) below) at least equal to the deferred Distributions on such Qualifying Capital Securities and apply the proceeds to pay unpaid Distributions on such Qualifying Capital Securities, commencing on the earlier of (x) the first Distribution Date after commencement of a deferral period on which such issuer pays current Distributions on such Qualifying Capital Securities and (y) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such deferral period, and that:
"Alternative Payment Mechanism"
(a) define "eligible proceeds" to mean, for purposes of such Alternative Payment Mechanism, the net proceeds (after underwriters' or placement agents' fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuance or sale of the relevant securities, where applicable, and including the fair market value of property received by the issuer or its Subsidiaries as consideration for such securities) that such issuer has received during the 180 days prior to the related Distribution Date from the issuance of APM Qualifying Securities to Persons other than the Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries, up to the Preferred Cap (as defined in (e) below) in the case of APM Qualifying Securities that are Qualifying Preferred Stock or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock;
(b) permit such issuer to pay current Distributions on any Distribution Date out of any source of funds but (x) require such issuer to pay deferred Distributions only out of eligible proceeds and (y) prohibit such issuer from paying deferred Distributions out of any source of funds other than eligible proceeds;
(c) if deferral of Distributions continues for more than one year (or such shorter period as may be provided for in the terms of such securities), require such issuer or any of its Subsidiaries not to redeem or purchase any securities that rank pari passu with or junior to any APM Qualifying Securities that such issuer has issued to settle deferred Distributions in respect to that deferral period until at least one year after all deferred Distributions have been paid (a "Purchase Restriction"), other than the following (none of which shall be restricted or prohibited by a Purchase Restriction):
(i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Common Stock in connection with any employment or compensatory contract, compensation or benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants; or
(ii) purchases or other acquisitions of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy shares of Common Stock entered into prior to the beginning of the related deferral period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan;
(d) limit the obligation of such issuer to issue (or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue) APM Qualifying Securities that are Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants to settle deferred Distributions pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism either (i) during the first five years of any deferral period or (ii) before an anniversary of the commencement of any deferral period that is not earlier than the fifth such anniversary and not later than the ninth such anniversary (as designated in the terms of such Qualifying Capital Securities) with respect to deferred Distributions attributable to the first five years of such deferral period, either:
 
(A) to an aggregate amount of such securities, the net proceeds from the issuance of which is equal to 2% of the product of the average of the current Market Value of the Common Stock on the ten consecutive trading days ending on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance multiplied by the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Corporation's most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements; or
(B) to a number of shares of Common Stock and shares issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants, in the aggregate, not in excess of 2% of the outstanding number of shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Corporation's most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements (the "Common Cap");
(e) limit the right of such issuer to issue (or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue) APM Qualifying Securities that are Qualifying Preferred Stock or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, to an amount from the issuance of such Qualifying Preferred Stock and then-still outstanding Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the related Alternative Payment Mechanism (including, in the case of Qualifying Preferred Stock, at any point in time from all prior issuances thereof pursuant to such Alternative Payment Mechanism) equal to 25% of the initial liquidation or principal amount of the Qualifying Capital Securities that are the subject of the related Alternative Payment Mechanism (the "Preferred Cap");
(f) in the case of Qualifying Capital Securities include a Bankruptcy Claim Limitation Provision; and
(g) permit such issuer, at its option, to provide that if such issuer is involved in a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, statutory share exchange, conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets to any other person or a similar transaction (a "business combination") where immediately after the consummation of the business combination more than 50% of the surviving or resulting entity's voting securities is owned by the equityholders of the other party to the business combination, or the entity to whom all or substantially all of such issuer's assets are conveyed, leased or otherwise transferred, then clauses (a), (b) and (c) above will not apply to any deferral period that is terminated on the next Distribution Date following the date of consummation of the business combination;
provided (and it being understood) that:
(h) the Alternative Payment Mechanism may at the discretion of such issuer include a share cap limiting the issuance of APM Qualifying Securities consisting of Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case to a maximum issuance cap to be set at the discretion of such issuer (a "Share Cap"); provided that such Share Cap will be subject to such issuer's agreement to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to increase the Share Cap when reached and (i) only to the extent it can do so and simultaneously satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under other securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in Common Stock or (ii) if such issuer cannot increase the Share Cap as contemplated in the preceding clause, by requesting its board of directors to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of shares of such issuer's authorized Common Stock or preferred stock for purposes of satisfying its obligations to pay deferred Distributions;
(i) such issuer shall not be obligated to issue (or use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to issue) APM Qualifying Securities for so long as a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing;
 
(j) if, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, such issuer is able to raise and apply some, but not all, of the eligible proceeds necessary to pay all deferred Distributions on any Distribution Date, such issuer will apply an amount equal to any available eligible proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid Distributions on the applicable Distribution Date in chronological order subject to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap, and the Share Cap (if any), as applicable; and
(k) if such issuer has outstanding more than one class or series of securities under which it is obligated to sell a type of APM Qualifying Securities and apply some part of the proceeds to the payment of deferred Distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by such issuer from those sales and available for payment of deferred Distributions on such securities shall be applied to such securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Cap, the Preferred Cap and the Share Cap (if any), as applicable, in proportion to the total amounts that are due on such securities.
means, with respect to any Alternative Payment Mechanism, any Debt Exchangeable for Preferred Equity or any Mandatory Trigger Provision, one or more of the following (as designated in the transaction documents for any Qualifying Capital Securities that include an Alternative Payment Mechanism or a Mandatory Trigger Provision or for any Debt Exchangeable for Preferred Equity):

(B) the Corporation may, without the consent of the holders of the Qualifying Capital Securities, amend the definition of APM Qualifying Securities to eliminate Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants (but not both) from the definition if, after the issue date, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance relating to an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards followed by the Corporation becomes effective or applicable to the Corporation such that, or the Corporation has been otherwise advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants from the definition of APM Qualifying Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's EPS.
(ii) if the APM Qualifying Securities for any Alternative Payment Mechanism or Mandatory Trigger Provision includes Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock and/or Qualifying Preferred Stock,
 
(A) such Alternative Payment Mechanism or Mandatory Trigger Provision may permit, but need not require, the Corporation to issue Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock; and
(B) the Corporation may, without the consent of the holders of the Qualifying Capital Securities, amend the definition of APM Qualifying Securities to eliminate Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock from the definition if, after the issue date, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance relating to an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards followed by the Corporation becomes effective or applicable to the Corporation such that, or the Corporation has been otherwise advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock from the definition of APM Qualifying Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's EPS.
means:
"Applicable Percentage"

In addition to the documents described above, we have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and reviewed such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion.
On the basis of such examination and review, we advise you that, in our opinion, when the Notes have been duly issued and sold in the manner contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, and assuming due authentication thereof by the Series Trustee or the Authenticating Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and the incorporation of this opinion by reference in the Registration Statement and to references to us under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes.

Exhibit 8.1
Dominion Resources, Inc.
120 Tredegar Street
Richmond, Virginia 23219
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement filed on January 29, 2009, as amended through the date hereof, and the Prospectus Supplement dated June 10, 2009 (the "Offering Documents"), for the purpose of offering up to $687,500,000 aggregate principal amount (including up to $62,500,000 aggregate principal amount issuable upon exercise of an over-allotment option) of the Company's 2009 Series A 8.375% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due June 15, 2064, subject to extensions to no later than June 15, 2079.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined the Junior Subordinated Indenture II, dated as of June 1, 2006, the form of Third Supplemental and Amending Indenture, and the form of Note, each to be entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Offering Documents and such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion.
In our examination, we have assumed that (i) the statements concerning the issuance of the Notes contained in the Offering Documents are true, correct and complete, (ii) the terms of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph will be complied with, (iii) the factual representations made to us by the Company in its officer's certificate dated as of the date hereof and delivered to us for purposes of this opinion (the "Officer's Certificate") are true, correct and complete, and (iv) any factual representations made in the Offering Documents or the Officer's Certificate "to the best knowledge of," in the "belief" of, or similarly qualified are true, correct and complete without such qualification. If any of the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the issuance of the Notes is consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which it is described in the Offering Documents, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.
Subject to and based solely upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that (1) the Notes will be treated as indebtedness of the Company for United States federal income tax purposes (although there is no controlling authority directly on point) and (2) insofar as it relates to matters of United Stated federal income tax law, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" is a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein.
Our opinion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Regulations (including temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations) issued thereunder, Internal Revenue Service rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Our opinion is limited to the matters expressly stated herein. Our opinion is rendered only as of the date hereof, and its validity could be affected by subsequent changes in applicable law. We have not undertaken to advise you or any other person with respect to any such change subsequent to the date hereof. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or a court would not take a contrary position with respect to any of the conclusions contained herein.
We are rendering this opinion to you solely in connection with the offering of the Notes, and this opinion is not to be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
/s/ McGuireWoods LLP
