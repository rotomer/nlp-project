Representations and Warranties of the Company

Such registration statement (i) is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) became effective not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date (as defined below), and the Company has not received any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act. As used herein, "Registration Statement" means, at any given time, such registration statement including the amendments thereto up to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the Incorporated Documents (as defined below) at such time and documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein at such time pursuant to the Rules and Regulations (as defined below); "Rule 430B Information" means information that was omitted from the Registration Statement at the time it became effective but that is deemed to be part of and included in the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act; "Base Prospectus" means the base prospectus included in the Registration Statement; "Preliminary Prospectus" means the Base Prospectus and any prospectus supplement used in connection with the offering of the Senior Notes that omitted the Rule 430B Information and is used prior to the filing of the Prospectus (as defined below); "Prospectus" means the prospectus supplement to

As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement," "Base Prospectus," "Preliminary Prospectus," "Prospectus" and "Prospectus Supplement" include all documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) incorporated therein by reference, whether such incorporated documents are filed before or after the date of such Registration Statement or Prospectus (collectively, the Incorporated Documents). When such Incorporated Documents are filed after the date of the document into which they are incorporated, they shall be deemed included therein from the date of filing of such Incorporated Documents.
At or before 1:25 p.m. on the date hereof (the Time of Sale), the Company had prepared the following information in connection with the offering (collectively, the Time of Sale Information): the Base Prospectus dated January 29, 2009, each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Term Sheet (as defined in Section 6(a)) and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined in Section 3A(c)) listed on Schedule VI hereto. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, each document included in the Time of Sale Information shall be deemed to include all documents (including any Current Report on Form 8-K) incorporated therein by reference, whether any such Incorporated Document is filed before or after the document into which it is incorporated, so long as the Incorporated Document is filed before the Time of Sale.
(b) No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or otherwise preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus has been issued by the Commission and is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the Trust Indenture Act), and the rules, regulations and releases of the Commission under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act (the Rules and Regulations); neither the Registration Statement on any date on which it has been deemed to have become effective (the Effective Date), the Prospectus as of its date nor the Time of Sale Information at the Time of Sale contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and, on the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including any amendments and supplements thereto) will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations, and none of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses (as supplemented by and taken together with the Time of Sale Information) or the Prospectus will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, that the foregoing representations and warranties in this Section 3A(b) shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free

(c) Other than the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the documents listed on Schedule VI, the Prospectus, or any document not constituting a prospectus under Section 2(a)(10)(a) of the Securities Act or Rule 134 under the Securities Act, the Company (including its agents and representatives, other than the Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not made, used, prepared, authorized, approved or referred to and will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to, any "written communication" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Senior Notes, unless such written communication is approved in writing in advance by the Representatives. To the extent any such written communication constitutes an "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act and referred to herein as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus), such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus complied or will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 433(c) and, if the filing thereof is required pursuant to Rule 433, such filing has been or will be made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433(d).

(e) Except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements after the date hereof), since the respective most recent dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendments or supplements after the date hereof), there has not been any material adverse change or event which would result in a material adverse effect on the condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, financial or otherwise (a Material Adverse Effect). The Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole have no material contingent financial obligation which is not disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.

(g) Dominion Energy, Inc., Dominion Transmission, Inc., Virginia Electric and Power Company and Virginia Power Energy Marketing, Inc. are the Company's only direct, and Dominion Energy Marketing, Inc., Dominion Exploration & Production, Inc., and Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. are the Company's only indirect, Significant Subsidiaries as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X, substituting in such definition June 30, 2009 and the 12 months period ended June 30, 2009 for the end of the most recently completed fiscal year and for the most recently completed fiscal year, respectively (each of the foregoing entities, a Significant Subsidiary and, collectively, the Significant Subsidiaries). All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable, and, with the exception of the outstanding preferred stock of Virginia Electric and Power Company which is owned by third parties, the capital stock of each such Significant Subsidiary is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, claim, encumbrance or equitable right.

(ii) On the Closing Date the Representatives shall receive, on behalf of the several Underwriters, the opinions of Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, McGuireWoods LLP, counsel to the Company, and the Company's General Counsel, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Schedules III, IV and V, respectively.
 
(iii) The Representatives shall have received from Deloitte & Touche LLP on the date of this Agreement and on the Closing Date letters addressed to the Representatives containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' SAS 72 "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, including any pro forma financial information.
(iv) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (A) except as reflected in, or contemplated by, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (exclusive of amendments or supplements after the date hereof), there shall not have occurred (1) any change in the senior debt securities of the Company of the same class as the Senior Notes (other than a decrease in the aggregate principal amount thereof outstanding or issuances of commercial paper in the ordinary course of business), (2) any material adverse change in the general affairs, financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (3) any material transaction entered into by the Company other than a transaction in the ordinary course of business, the effect of which in each such case in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is so material and so adverse that it makes it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Senior Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement, and (B) there shall not have occurred (1) a downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's senior unsecured notes, or securities that areto the Company's senior unsecured notes, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act) and no such organization shall have given any notice of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change with possible negative implications in its ratings of such securities, (2) any general suspension of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange or any limitation on prices for such trading or any restrictions on the distribution of securities established by the New York Stock Exchange or by the Commission or by any federal or state agency or by the decision of any court, (3) a suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (4) a banking moratorium declared either by federal or New York State authorities or (5) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or crisis resulting in the declaration of a national emergency, or any material adverse change in the financial markets; provided the effect of such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity, crisis or material adverse change shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, make it impracticable to proceed with the public offering or delivery of the Senior Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and this Agreement.
pari passu
 
(v) On the Closing Date, the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be true and correct as if made on and as of such date, and the Company shall have performed all obligations and satisfied all conditions required of it under this Agreement; and, on the Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received a certificate to such effect signed by the President or any Vice President of the Company.
(vi) All legal proceedings to be taken in connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes shall have been satisfactory in form and substance to Troutman Sanders LLP.
(b) In case any of the conditions specified above in Section 7(a) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives upon mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however, that in case the conditions specified in subsections 7(a)(v) and (vi) shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may not be so terminated by the Representatives unless Underwriters who have agreed to purchase in the aggregate 50% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes shall have consented to such termination and the aforesaid notice shall so state. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 7(c) and 9 hereof.
(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 7(b) above or because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, then in any such case, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (in addition to the fees and disbursements of their outside counsel as provided in Section 6(h)) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder and, upon such reimbursement, the Company shall be absolved from any further liability hereunder, except as provided in Sections 6(c) and 9.
8. . The obligation of the Company to deliver the Senior Notes shall be subject to the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 7(a)(i) and in Section 7(a)(ii). In case such conditions shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company by mailing or delivering written notice thereof to the Representatives. Any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 6(c), 6(h), 9 and 10 hereof.
Conditions of the Obligation of the Company
9. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors and officers and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
 
Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each such Underwriter, director, officer, and controlling person for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used on or prior to the date hereof), the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arising out of or based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or any such omission or alleged omission, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or otherwise in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives for use in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto, in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto, in any Preliminary Prospectus or in the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the Company contained in this Section 9(a) and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Senior Notes.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or any other statute or common law and to reimburse each of them for any legal or other expenses (including, to the extent hereinafter provided, reasonable outside counsel fees) incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or in connection with defending any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in either such document as amended or supplemented (if any amendments or supplements thereto shall have been furnished), any Preliminary Prospectus (if and when used prior to the date hereof), or the Time of Sale Information or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon information furnished herein or in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to
 
either thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information. The indemnity agreement of the respective Underwriters contained in this Section 9(b) shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of the Senior Notes.
(c) The Company and each of the Underwriters agree that, upon the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against the Company or any of its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company, or against such Underwriter or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons as aforesaid, in respect of which indemnity may be sought on account of any indemnity agreement contained herein, it will promptly give written notice of the commencement thereof to the party or parties against whom indemnity shall be sought hereunder, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party or parties of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party otherwise than on account of such indemnity agreement. In case such notice of any such action shall be so given, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume (in conjunction with any other indemnifying parties) the defense of such action, in which event such defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such indemnifying party (or parties) and satisfactory to the indemnified party or parties who shall be defendant or defendants in such action, and such defendant or defendants shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional outside counsel retained by them; provided that, if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or parties) and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (or parties), the indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to participate otherwise in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel retained by the indemnified party if (i) the indemnified party shall have retained such counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to one local counsel), representing the indemnified parties under Section 9(a) or 9(b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall have elected not to assume the defense of such action, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the commencement of the action, or (iv) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
 
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such a proceeding), unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, including relative benefit. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations under this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
10. . If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Senior Notes which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, then the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the principal amount of the Senior Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Senior Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall so fail or refuse to purchase Senior Notes and the aggregate
Termination
 
principal amount of the Senior Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Senior Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter (except as provided in Sections 6(g) and 9) or of the Company (except as provided in Sections 6(b) and 9). In any such case not involving a termination, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
11. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Senior Notes.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
12. . The validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Company, the Underwriters and, with respect to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, each controlling person and each officer and director of the Company and the Underwriters referred to in Section 9, and their respective successors, assigns, executors and administrators. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give to any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. The term "successors" as used in this Agreement shall not include any purchaser, as such, of any of the Senior Notes from any of the several Underwriters. The Company and the Underwriters each acknowledge and agree that in connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Underwriters have an arms length business relationship that creates no fiduciary duty on the part of either party and each expressly disclaims any fiduciary relationship, except that the Underwriters acknowledge that they owe a duty of trust or confidence to the Company as contemplated by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 100 (17 CFR 243.100) of Regulation FD under the Securities Exchange Act.
Miscellaneous
13. . All communications hereunder shall be in writing and if to the Underwriters shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to the Representatives at the address set forth on Schedule II hereto, or if to the Company shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to it, attention of Treasurer, Dominion Resources, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 (facsimile number: (804) 819-2211).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the arrangements for issuance by Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company) of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Series A 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes) and the offering of the Senior Notes by you pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated August 11, 2009, by and between you and the Company (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and the Series Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Series Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
In addition, we attended the closing held today at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement that are required to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.
Based upon the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations that we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has the corporate power to transact its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
2. No approval or consent by any public regulatory body is legally required in connection with the sale of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement (except to the extent that compliance with the provisions of securities or blue sky laws of certain states may be required in connection with the sale of the Senior Notes in such states) and the carrying out of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
4. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
5. The Senior Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and when completed and authenticated by the Series Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
 
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
6. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-157013) with respect to the Senior Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Senior Notes in the manner therein specified.
7. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except that we express no comment or belief with respect to any historical or pro forma financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Prospectus) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
8. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Senior Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES, as supplemented by the statements under DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated August 11, 2009, are substantially accurate and fair.
We have not undertaken to determine independently the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or in the Prospectus, and as to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes statistical statements in the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraph 8 in regard to the statements described in such numbered paragraph 8. We note that the Incorporated Documents were prepared and filed by the Company without our participation. We have, however, participated in conferences with counsel for and representatives of the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus as it was initially issued and as it has been supplemented or amended, and we have reviewed the Incorporated Documents and such of the corporate records of the Company as we deemed advisable. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in the Underwriting Agreement. None of the foregoing participation, review or attendance disclosed to us any information that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, or the Prospectus contained on its date or the date it was supplemented or amended, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in all cases, excepting the financial statements and schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated
 
therein by reference, any pro forma financial information and notes thereto, and the Statement of Eligibility of the Indenture Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, included or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as to which we express no belief) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (or, with respect to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, now omits) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
In rendering the opinions set forth in paragraphs (1)  (8) above and in making the statements expressed in the preceding paragraph, we do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the Company), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2009 Series A 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes) pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated August 11, 2009, by and between
 
the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company, indentures, agreements, and other instruments, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and the Series Trustee, and other documents, as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to various questions of fact material to such opinions, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certifications by officers of the Company, the Series Trustee and other appropriate persons and statements contained in the Registration Statement hereinafter mentioned. All legal proceedings taken as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement have been satisfactory to us.
On this basis we are of the opinion that:
1. No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (other than those required under the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations, have been obtained, or as may be required under the securities or blue sky laws of the various states) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement or the due execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the Company or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Senior Notes as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
2. The Indenture has been authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
3. The Senior Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when completed and authenticated by the Series Trustee in accordance with, and in the form contemplated by, the Indenture and issued, delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will have been duly issued under the Indenture and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
4. The Registration Statement (Reg. No. 333-157013) with respect to the Senior Notes filed pursuant to the Securities Act is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that was filed with the Commission not earlier than
 
three years prior to the Closing Date, and the Prospectus may lawfully be used for the purposes specified in the Securities Act in connection with the offer for sale of Senior Notes in the manner therein specified.
5. The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (except the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act, and to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
6. We are of the opinion that the statements relating to the Senior Notes contained in the Base Prospectus under DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES and ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES, as supplemented by the statements under DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES in the Prospectus Supplement dated August 11, 2009, are substantially accurate and fair.
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus were discussed, and we have consulted with officers and other employees of the Company to inform them of the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. We have examined various reports, records, contracts and other documents of the Company and orders and instruments of public officials, which our investigation led us to deem pertinent. In addition, we participated in one or more due diligence conferences with representatives of the Company and attended the closing at which the Company satisfied the conditions contained in Section 7 of the Underwriting Agreement. We have not, however, undertaken to make any independent review of other records of the Company which our investigation did not lead us to deem pertinent. As to the statistical statements in the Registration Statement (which includes the Incorporated Documents), we have relied solely on the officers of the Company. We accordingly assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the statements made in the Registration Statement, except as stated above in numbered paragraph 6 in regard to the statements described in such paragraph 6. But such conferences, consultation, examination and attendance disclosed to us no information with respect to such other matters that gives us reason to believe that the Registration Statement contained on any date the Registration Statement became effective, the Time of Sale Information contained at the Time of Sale, the Prospectus contained as of its date, or that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contains on the date hereof (in each case, except with respect to the financial statements, any pro forma financial information and schedules and other financial information and the Statement of Eligibility of the Indenture Trustee filed on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted on such date or omits on the date hereof to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The foregoing assurance is provided on the basis that, except as otherwise provided in Section 3A(a) of the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Time of Sale Information, any statement contained in an Incorporated Document will be deemed not to be contained in the
 
Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus if the statement has been modified or superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed Incorporated Document or in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of New York and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent.
 
 
To: The Addressees Listed on Annex A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The arrangements for issuance of up to U.S. $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2009 Series A 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes), of Dominion Resources, Inc. (the Company), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated August 11, 2009, by and between the Company and the Underwriters listed on Schedule I attached thereto (the Underwriting Agreement), have been taken under my supervision as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
As Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, I have general responsibility over the attorneys within the Company's Legal Department responsible for rendering legal counsel to the Company regarding corporate, financial, securities and other matters. I am generally familiar with the organization, business and affairs of the Company. I am also familiar with the proceedings taken and proposed to be taken by the Company in connection with the offering and sale of the Senior Notes, and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of the law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In addition, I have responsibility for supervising lawyers who may have been asked by me or others to review legal matters arising in connection with the offering and sale of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, some of the matters referred to herein have not been handled personally by me, but I have been made familiar with the facts and circumstances and the applicable law, and the opinions herein expressed are my own or are opinions of others in which I concur.
 
On this basis I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Virginia, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement; and the Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the respective laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or to be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
3. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
4. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened, to which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's, or any of its subsidiaries', properties is subject other than any proceedings described in the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus and proceedings which I believe are not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the power or ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby or by the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus.
I am a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Virginia and I do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. This opinion may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any person without our prior written consent. I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein resulting from matters that may hereinafter arise or that may hereinafter be brought to my attention.

Dominion Resources, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Virginia (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to [Cede & Co.]**, or registered assigns (the "Holder"), the principal sum of          Dollars ($        ) on August 15, 2019 and to pay interest thereon from August 14, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2010, at the rate of 5.20% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, provided that any principal, and any such installment of interest, that is overdue shall
 
 
bear interest at the rate of 5.20% per annum (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Series A Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest; provided that the interest payable at Stated Maturity, on a Redemption Date or Repayment Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. The Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on the Business Day preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, that with respect to Series A Senior Notes that are not represented by one or more Global Securities, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on the 15th calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Series A Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Series Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Series A Senior Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Series A Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
Payments of interest on the Series A Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Series A Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Series A Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Series A Senior Note will be made at the office of the Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, with any such payment that is due at the Stated Maturity of any Series A Senior Note, upon redemption or repurchase being made upon surrender of such Series A Senior Note to such office or agency; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest, subject to such surrender where applicable, may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Series Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Series A Senior Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Series Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Series A Senior Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2000, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank)) (the "Original Trustee"), as amended by the Thirty-Eighth Supplemental and Amending Indenture dated as of November 1, 2008 (as so amended, the "Base Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Original Trustee and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as Series Trustee, as heretofore supplemented and as further supplemented by a Thirty-Ninth Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 1, 2009 (the "Thirty-Ninth Supplemental Indenture" and together with the Base Indenture, as it may be hereafter supplemented or amended from time to time, the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), by and between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee of the series of Securities established thereby (herein called the "Series Trustee," which term includes any successor series trustee for the Series A Senior Notes under the Indenture) and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Original Trustee, the Series Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (the "Series A Senior Notes") which is unlimited in aggregate principal amount.
The Series A Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee for the series of Securities affected, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Series A Senior Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Series A Senior Note and of any Series A Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Series A Senior Note.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Series A Senior Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Series Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of
 
Default with respect to the Series A Senior Notes, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Series Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Series Trustee and offered the Series Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Series Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Series A Senior Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Series A Senior Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or premium, if any, or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series A Senior Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series A Senior Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Series A Senior Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Series A Senior Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series A Senior Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series A Senior Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Series A Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any greater integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Series A Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes having the same Stated Maturity and of like tenor of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder upon surrender of the Series A Senior Note or Series A Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
