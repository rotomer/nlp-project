Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset. DRI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, that DRI and its Affiliates shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate, and after Closing shall cause the Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries to cooperate, with DRI in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights.

(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is prohibited without such consent or a fee is payable (unless the same has been paid by Purchaser). In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Mineral Interest(s) to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, the Contract shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any obligations under such Contract to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to perform under such Contract until such consent is obtained. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Mineral Interest or a Well and the third-party consent to the transfer of the Mineral Interest or Well is not obtained by Closing, Purchaser may elect to treat the unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title Defect (disregarding the Individual Title Threshold and Aggregate Title Deductible) and receive the appropriate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 by giving DRI written notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.5(a), except that such notice may be given up to six (6) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date. If an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.5 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b), Sellers shall be reimbursed in that final adjustment for the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Mineral Interest or Well, if not previously transferred to Purchaser under the first sentence of this Section 3.7(b), shall be transferred, and the provisions of this Section 3.7 shall no longer apply to such consent requirement.
(c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing if owned by DTI, and the affected Assets shall

be deemed to be deleted from Exhibits A-1, A-2, B-1 or B-2 to this Agreement, as applicable, for all purposes.
(d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 3.7, such Assets shall be included in the transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and DRI shall, at its sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith as set forth in Section 3.7(a).
(e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise same (whether before or after Closing), then:
(i) If the affected Assets are owned by DTI, DTI shall convey them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential right provision. If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing by DTI, Purchaser agrees to transfer the affected Assets back to DTI on the terms and provisions set out herein to permit DTI to comply with its obligation (or, if DTI requests, Purchaser shall transfer the affected Assets directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential purchase right provision);
(ii) If the affected Assets are owned by either Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable, shall transfer them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential purchase right provision. If Closing has already occurred, Purchaser shall cause such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable, to perform this obligation;
(iii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), the applicable Seller(s) shall credit Purchaser with the Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to Section 3.7(e)(i) or (e)(ii) (or, if the transfer of the Asset occurs after the Cut-Off Date, Sellers shall promptly refund to Purchaser the Allocated Value in respect of such Asset);
(iv) Such Seller(s) shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder (which shall, if received by either Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary after Closing, be paid to such Seller(s) by such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable, or by Purchaser as agent for and on behalf of such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable);
(v) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser shall account for revenues earned and costs incurred by it or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Assets during the period from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, which the Parties agree shall be calculated in the same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3 with such changes as are necessary to reflect Purchaser's, direct or indirect, ownership of such Assets during such period. The net amount of any

adjustment under this Section 3.7(e)(v), if positive, shall be paid by Purchaser to such Seller and, if negative, by such Seller to Purchaser; and
(vi) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, the Seller that transferred such Assets (or the Shares of the Company holding such Assets) shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser with respect to such Assets under Section 11.1, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by or arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such Asset from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding, however, any such Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by the actions of, or implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, after Closing, breach of any contract by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, after Closing, or gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary after Closing.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 15, 2010
 
RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced that it has agreed to sell its natural gas and oil exploration and production business to a newly-formed subsidiary of CONSOL Energy (NYSE: CNX), for a total of $3.475 billion, subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The transaction includes the rights to approximately 491,000 acres in the Marcellus formation.
"With today's announced divestiture, Dominion is taking another significant step in moving toward a more regulated business model. This transaction is accretive to earnings per share, reduces our commodity sensitivity by over 20 percent, and eliminates our need to issue new shares to fund our infrastructure growth program through 2011," said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Farrell II.
"We are gratified that CONSOL will end up with such an outstanding company. Dominion's exploration and production activities in the Appalachian region have had an excellent record of success. We wish to thank the employees of our E&P business for their outstanding work and professionalism."
"The decision to sell our E&P business came as a result of our previously-announced plan to monetize our Marcellus acreage, either in multiple transactions or all at once. As we analyzed the various alternatives, and their respective impact on the value of the remaining business, we determined that combining our conventional Appalachian E&P
operations with the rights to the Marcellus formation resulted in the best long-term value for our investors," Farrell said.
Farrell added: "Our regulated businesses are now expected to contribute about 70 percent of our consolidated operating earnings in 2011, up from less than 45 percent in 2006. Exiting the E&P business will enhance the visibility of our core natural gas pipeline and storage businesses and reduce our on-going capital expenditures by approximately $200 million per year. Our activities in the Appalachian region will focus on investments such as the Appalachian Gateway project as well as the significant amount of new gathering and pipeline infrastructure that development of the Marcellus formation will demand."
The transaction is expected to close by April 30, subject to customary closing conditions. Estimated after-tax proceeds of $2.2 to $2.4 billion, depending on the final tax determination, should enable Dominion to offset its equity needs for 2010 and 2011, fund the revenue credits to Dominion Virginia Power customers included in the rate case settlement agreement and repurchase common stock. Proceeds could also be used to fund a contribution to our employee benefit plans and/or reduce debt.
The company is affirming its 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. In providing its full-year 2010 operating earnings guidance the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported (GAAP) earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. With the exception of the Dominion Peoples and Appalachian E&P divestitures, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance. At this time, Dominion management expects the February 2010 sale of Dominion Peoples to result in an after-tax loss of approximately $140 million, as well as after-tax expenses of approximately $50 million that would negatively impact full-year 2010 reported earnings, but would not be included in operating earnings. Also, Dominion management expects an after-tax gain of approximately $1.37 billion for the Appalachian E&P sale to be reflected in 2010 reported earnings, but would not be included in 2010 operating earnings.
Dominion is being advised in the sale by the investment banking firm of Barclays Capital Inc. Baker Botts L.L.P. is the company's legal adviser for the sale.
Dominion is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy, with a portfolio of more than 27,500 megawatts of generation, 12,000 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline and 6,000 miles of electric transmission lines. Dominion operates the nation's largest natural gas storage system with 942 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and serves retail energy customers in 12 states.

This release contains certain forward-looking statements, including forecasted operating earnings for 2010 which is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations may include factors that are beyond the company's ability to control or estimate
 
precisely, such as fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, the timing of the closing dates of acquisitions or divestitures, estimates of future market conditions, access to and costs of capital, fluctuations in the value of our pension assets and assets held in our decommissioning trusts, estimates of proved and unproved reserves, the company's ability to meet its natural gas and oil production forecasts, the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned projects, acquisitions and divestitures, and the ability to complete planned construction or expansion projects as scheduled. Other factors include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes and major storms on operations, the behavior of other market participants, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments and changes to environmental and other laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, greenhouse gases and other emissions to which we are subject, economic conditions in the company's service area, risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures, changes to regulated gas and electric rates collected by Dominion, changes to rating agency requirements and ratings, changing financial accounting standards, trading counter-party credit risks, risks related to energy trading and marketing, adverse outcomes in litigation matters, and other uncertainties. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominion's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
