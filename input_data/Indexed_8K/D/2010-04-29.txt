RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended March 31, 2010, of $174 million ($0.29 per share), compared with reported earnings of $248 million ($0.42 per share) for the same period in 2009.
Operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2010, amounted to $576 million ($0.96 per share), compared to operating earnings of $574 million ($0.98 per share) for the same period in 2009. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2010 and 2009 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
First-quarter operating earnings were in line with our expectations.  In addition to the first-quarter earnings results, two significant events occurred in the quarter that will allow us to continue moving toward our goal of becoming a more regulated company and one less sensitive to commodity prices.  First, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the comprehensive settlement agreement for the 2009 Virginia Jurisdictional Base Rate case that was agreed to by all parties.  Second, we reached an agreement to sell the remainder of our natural gas and oil exploration and production business to a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy.
As we move forward, we continue to see strong growth opportunities.  Specifically, the Dominion service territory peak demand will grow an additional 5,600 megawatts over the next 10 years, as forecasted by PJM.  We continue to focus on our regulated infrastructure growth plan for new generation and electric transmission to meet the expected customer demand for electricity over the next decade.  In addition, we are focused on building the necessary pipelines, gathering and products extraction infrastructure required to meet the needs of the emerging Marcellus supply.
We are making substantial progress on our electric infrastructure expansion plans with nearly 1,200 megawatts of generation under construction through our Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center and Bear Garden projects, plus two significant 500 kV electric transmission lines.  On the gas side, construction began on our Cove Point Pier Expansion in mid-March and we recently announced our Marcellus 404 natural gas gathering, processing and transportation project, which will help meet the increasing infrastructure needs of producers in the Marcellus region.
With the solid performance in the first quarter and our plans for the remainder of the year, we are affirming our 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per share.  We will provide details about our 2010 operating earnings guidance, as well as other long-term growth drivers, on May 7 at our Investor and Analyst Meeting in New York City.
First-quarter 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
The decrease in first-quarter 2010 operating earnings per share as compared to first-quarter 2009 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to lower merchant generation margins, lower gas and oil production as a result of the expiration of overriding royalty interests associated with former volumetric production payment agreements and lower contributions from producer services.  Partially offsetting these negatives were higher contributions from the regulated electric utility and gas transmission businesses including favorable weather in the regulated electric service territory.
Complete details of first-quarter 2010 operating earnings as compared to 2009 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Second-quarter 2010 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects second-quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of 55 cents per share to 65 cents per share as compared to second-quarter 2009 operating earnings of 68 cents per share. Negative factors for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year include higher planned outage expenses, lower merchant generation margins, a higher effective income tax rate and absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys E&P operations beginning May 1, 2010.  Factors partially offsetting these negatives include higher rate adjustment clause revenues and accretion due to share repurchases. Reported earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were 76 cents per share.
In providing its second-quarter and full-year 2010 operating earnings guidance the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles.  At this time, Dominion management is able to estimate that the announced sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations would have an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion that would not be included in second-quarter 2010 operating earnings.  However, Dominion management is currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these other items on reported earnings.  Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.
