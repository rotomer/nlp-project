RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended June 30, 2010, of $1.761 billion ($2.98 per share), compared with reported earnings of $454 million ($0.76 per share) for the same period in 2009.
Operating earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2010, amounted to $426 million ($0.72 per share), compared to operating earnings of $404 million ($0.68 per share) for the same period in 2009. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2010 and 2009 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
Our core businesses continued to deliver solid results in the second quarter.  Coupled with the benefit of hot weather in our electric service territory, we are able to report second-quarter operating earnings well above expectations.
We continue to implement our regulated infrastructure investment strategy.  Our new electric generation and transmission projects, which are required to meet the growing demand for electricity by our customers, are on schedule and on budget.  During the quarter, we completed a 75 megawatt uprate at our North Anna nuclear power station.  The two generating stations under construction  Virginia City and Bear Garden  are both nearly 70 percent complete.  Also, we continue to move forward with the planned gas-fired generating station in Warren County and expect to file with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in early 2011.
Construction of our two largest electric transmission projects is proceeding as planned.  Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun phases I and II are complete and work is progressing well on the final phase.  In addition, the Carson-to-Suffolk 500 kilovolt line is now over 30 percent complete.
We were also active in our regulated gas businesses during the quarter.  In support of the Marcellus Northeast project, we announced a 15-year contract with CONSOL.  This project is an example of our ability to provide scalable projects for producers in the Marcellus region.  In addition, we filed our Appalachian Gateway project application in June with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Appalachian Gateway is designed to help meet the demand for natural gas in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States, and is on track for its planned 2012 in-service date.
Given our strong performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the second half of the year, we are increasing the bottom of our 2010 operating earnings guidance range.  The new 2010 operating earnings guidance is $3.25 to $3.40 per share, up from $3.20 to $3.40 per share.
 
 
Second-quarter 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
The increase in second-quarter 2010 operating earnings per share as compared to second-quarter 2009 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to higher contributions from the regulated electric utility business including favorable weather in the regulated electric service territory, higher FERC transmission and rate adjustment clause revenue, lower interest expense, lower outage costs and lower operation and maintenance expenses.  Partially offsetting these positives were lower merchant generation margins, lower contributions from producer services and the absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys E&P operations beginning May 1, 2010.
Complete details of second-quarter 2010 operating earnings as compared to second-quarter 2009 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Third-quarter 2010 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects third-quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of 99 cents per share to $1.04 per share as compared to third-quarter 2009 operating earnings of 99 cents per share.  Positive factors for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of the prior year include higher rate adjustment clause revenue, lower planned outage expenses and a return to normal weather.  Factors partially offsetting these positives include lower merchant generation margins and absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys E&P operations beginning May 1, 2010.  Reported earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $1.00 per share.
In providing its third-quarter and full-year 2010 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles.  At this time, Dominion management is able to estimate that the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations will result in an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion that will not be included in 2010 operating earnings.  Dominion management is also able to estimate that the implementation of a work-force reduction program, the impairment of a merchant generation asset, the sale of Peoples Gas and the elimination of certain tax deductions associated with health care legislation changes will result in a net after- tax loss of approximately $500 million that will not be included in 2010 operating earnings.  At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of other items on reported earnings.  Accordingly, Dominion is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.
