EXPLANATORY NOTE
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a 100 megabyte limitation on the size of EDGAR filings. The attached agreement, together with exhibits and schedules, which was intended to be filed with Dominion Resources, Inc.'s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for the period ended June 30, 2010 (Form 10-Q), would have caused our Form 10-Q submission to exceed 100 megabytes and therefore had to be split into a separate filing on Form 8-K in order to transmit all the information to the SEC. This Form 8-K is filed solely to submit the exhibit document that is incorporated by reference in the Form 10-Q as Exhibit 10.7.
 
In response to a request from the SEC, Dominion has committed to file with its next periodic report the entire agreement together with all exhibits and schedules, for certain of the material contracts listed in the Exhibit Index of Dominion's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009. As referenced in the Explanatory Note, because of size limitations imposed by the SEC on EDGAR filings, the agreement attached hereto as an exhibit is being filed in its entirety with this Form 8-K in order for Dominion to satisfy such commitment by incorporating the agreement by reference into its Form 10-Q. The agreement relates to the sale by Dominion, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, of certain of its oil and gas exploration and production assets and has been previously filed with the SEC; however certain of the exhibits and schedules relating thereto had been inadvertently omitted.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined as follows:
(i) if Purchaser and Sellers agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;
 
(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the appropriate Seller's, Wholly-Owned Company's or the Subsidiary's interest in the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease;
(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue interest for any Unit, Well or PUD Lease and (B) the net revenue interest or percentage stated on Exhibit B-2 or D-2 (as appropriate), then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Unit, Well or PUD Lease multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest or percentage ownership decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue interest or percentage ownership stated on Exhibit B-2 or D-2, provided that if the Title Defect does not affect the Unit, Well or PUD Lease throughout its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section 3.5(g)(iii) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period only;
(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Unit, Well or PUD Lease so affected, the portion of the respective Seller's, Wholly-Owned Company's or the Subsidiary's interest in the Unit, Well or PUD Lease affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Unit, Well or PUD Lease, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Sellers and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A) an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given prior to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with respect thereto exceeds Two Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($2,500,000), (B) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any given Unit, Well or PUD Lease shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Unit, Well or PUD Lease and (C) there shall be no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for Title Defects unless and until the aggregate Title Defect Amounts that are entitled to an adjustment under Section 3.5(g)(v)(A) and for which Claim Notices were timely delivered exceed Twenty-Five Million dollars ($25,000,000), and then only to the extent that such aggregate Title Defect Amounts exceed Twenty-Five Million dollars ($25,000,000);
(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) or (iv) above shall not be greater than the amount that can reasonably be shown to be the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Title Defect; and
(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(i) Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts by ten (10) Business Days after the Title Claim Date.

In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.5(g) and 3.5(h) and may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination.

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send (i) notices to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on Schedule 4.11 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.11 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8. The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Sellers shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate, and after Closing shall cause the Wholly-Owned Companies and the Subsidiary to cooperate, with Sellers in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights.
(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is prohibited or a fee is payable (unless the same has been paid by Purchaser) without the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Lease(s) to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, the Contract shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any obligations under such Contract to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to perform under such Contract until such consent is obtained. In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Lease and the third Person consent to the transfer of the Lease is not obtained by Closing, Purchaser may elect to treat the unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title Defect and receive the appropriate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.3 by giving DEPI written notice thereof in accordance with Section 3.5(a), except that such notice may be given up to six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If an unsatisfied consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section 3.5 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b), Sellers shall be reimbursed in that final adjustment for the amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Lease, if not previously transferred to Purchaser under the first sentence of this Section 3.6(b), shall be transferred, and the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall no longer apply to such consent requirement.
 
(c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing if owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibits B and/or D to this Agreement, as applicable, for all purposes.
(d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 3.6, such Assets shall be included in the transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and Sellers shall, at their sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall continue to be responsible for the compliance therewith.
(e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise the same (whether before or after Closing), then:
(i) If the affected Assets are owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves, DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves shall convey them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential right provision. If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchaser agrees to transfer the affected Assets back to the applicable Seller on the terms and provisions set out herein to permit such Seller to comply with this obligation (or, if the applicable Seller so requests, shall transfer the affected Assets directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential purchase right provision);
(ii) If the affected Assets are owned by a Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary, the Company or Subsidiary shall transfer them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential purchase right provision. If Closing has already occurred, Purchaser shall cause the Company or Subsidiary to perform this obligation;
(iii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), the applicable Seller(s) shall credit Purchaser with the Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to Section 3.6(e)(i) or (e)(ii);
(iv) Such Seller(s) shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder (which shall, if received by a Company or Subsidiary after Closing, be paid to such Seller(s) by such Company or Subsidiary or by Purchaser as agent for and on behalf of such Company or Subsidiary);
(v) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves and were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, Purchase Price adjustments calculated in the same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3(h) shall be calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance and the net amount of such adjustment, if positive, shall be paid by Purchaser to such Seller and, if negative, by such Seller to Purchaser;
 
(vi) If the affected Assets were owned by DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves and were previously transferred to Purchaser at Closing, DEPI, DOTEPI or Reserves, as applicable, shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser with respect to such Assets under Section 12.1, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by or arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such Asset from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding, however, any such Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by the actions of, or implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary after Closing, breach of any contract by Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary after Closing, or gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Purchaser or any Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary after Closing; and
(vii) In the event that the value of any Property operated by any Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary is materially impaired by the exercise of a preferential purchase right with respect to a Property also operated by such Seller, Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary on which infrastructure is used by the first Property without the benefit of an agreement for such use which would survive the transfer of title to the third party preferential purchase right holder, Purchaser may claim such material impairment as a Title Defect.
Section 3.7 .The representation and warranty in Section 3.1 shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date and shall have no further force and effect thereafter, provided there shall be no termination of Purchaser's or Sellers' rights under Section 3.5 with respect to any bona fide Title Defect or Title Benefit claim properly reported on or before the Title Claim Date.

In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.
Claim Notice
Claim
 
(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this Article 12. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.
(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 12.3(d), provided that the Indemnified Person may file initial pleadings as described in the last sentence of paragraph (c) above if required by court or procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30) day period in paragraph (c) above. An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).
(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity with respect to the Claim.
 
(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification hereunder.
Section 12.4 .
Casualty and Condemnation
(a) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close.

In each case, Sellers shall retain (or, if applicable, receive an assignment from the Wholly-Owned Company or the Subsidiary owning the affected properties of) all rights to insurance and other claims against third Persons with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.
(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close; provided, however, as its sole remedy for any expropriation, condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall be entitled to any awards payable to Sellers, the Wholly-Owned Companies, or the Subsidiary resulting from any such action up to the Allocated Value of the Asset; it being understood and agreed that none of Sellers, the Companies or the Subsidiary shall have any liability whatsoever to Purchaser with respect to any such expropriation, condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain, other than payment of such award (up to the Allocated Value of the Asset).

Representation and Warranties
6. . This Guarantee and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferrable by Guarantor or Purchaser except with the prior written consent of Purchaser (in the case of an assignment by Guarantor) or Guarantor (in the case of an assignment by Purchaser).
