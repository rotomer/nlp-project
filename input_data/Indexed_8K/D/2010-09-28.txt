(a) Except for Base Rate Loans computed using the Prime Rate, on which interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.
(b) It is the intent of the Lenders and each Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrowers are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum non-usurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum non-usurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans of the relevant Borrower and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the relevant Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans of the relevant Borrower. The right to demand payment of the Loans of any Borrower or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permitted by applicable law.
3.8 .
Sharing of Payments
Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from
pro
rata
 
time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation in Loans made to such Borrower may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.
3.9 .
Evidence of Debt
(a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to a Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by or for the account of each Borrower from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register for each Borrower pursuant to Section 12.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Registers and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder in accordance with the documents submitted by a Borrower under Section 2.2, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
(c) The entries made in the accounts, Registers and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.9 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of each Borrower therein recorded; , however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Registers or such subaccounts, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender to such Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof.

In the event that the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (i) that U.S. dollar deposits in the principal amounts requested with respect to a Eurodollar Loan are not generally available in the London interbank Eurodollar market or (ii) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give notice of such determination to the Borrowers and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any request by a Borrower for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), and (B) any request by a Borrower for conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Revolving Loans shall be deemed to be a request for conversion into or continuation of Base Rate Loans.
Unavailability
(b) .
Change in Legality
(i) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice to the relevant Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:
(A) declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender to such Borrower hereunder, whereupon any request by such Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
(B) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it to such Borrower be converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be).
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (A) or (B) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender to such Borrower or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to such Borrower shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) made by such Lender to such Borrower in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.
 
(c) . If at any time a Lender or Issuing Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to the making, the commitment to make or the maintaining of any Eurodollar Loan or the issuance, the commitment to issue or the maintaining of any Letter of Credit or any participation therein because of (i) any change since the date of this Credit Agreement in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or such order) including, without limitation, the imposition, modification or deemed applicability of any reserves, deposits or similar requirements (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or (ii) other circumstances affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market; then the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender promptly upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender or Issuing Lender may determine in its sole discretion) as may be required to compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder.
Increased Costs
Each determination and calculation made by a Lender or Issuing Lender under this Section 4.1 shall, absent manifest error, be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
4.2 .
Capital Adequacy
If any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that the adoption or effectiveness, after the date hereof, of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender or Issuing Lender (or its parent corporation) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Lender's (or parent corporation's) capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to any Borrower to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Lender (or its parent corporation) could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Lender's (or parent corporation's) policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Lender or Issuing Lender, the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such additional amount or amounts (but without duplication of any amounts payable under Section 4.1(c)) as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender (or its parent corporation) for such reduction. Each determination by any such Lender or Issuing Lender of amounts owing under this Section 4.2 shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.
 
4.3 .
Compensation
Each Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request, for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by the Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans to such Borrower) which such Lender may sustain:
(a) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans to such Borrower does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Competitive Bid Request to such Borrower, as the case may be;
(b) if any repayment, continuation or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan by such Borrower occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, including, without limitation, in connection with any demand, acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise (including any demand under this Section 4); or
(c) if such Borrower fails to repay its Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan when required by the terms of this Credit Agreement.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 4.3 shall be made as though the Lender has actually funded its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America; , , that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 4.3.

If such Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes (as defined in Section 4.4(b)) from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, as determined in good faith by the applicable Withholding Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.4) the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, evidence of such payment to the relevant Governmental Authority.
Tax Liabilities

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be payable by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.4(c) to the extent that such Taxes or Other Taxes resulted solely from the applicable Lender's failure to submit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or before the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Person that becomes a Lender after the Closing Date by assignment, promptly upon such assignment) the applicable forms described in Section 4.4(f).
(d) Without duplication of any amounts paid to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.7, each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for the full amount of any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings or similar charges imposed by any Governmental Authority that are attributable to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, together with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, as determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

In the event a Lender makes a request to a Borrower for additional payments in accordance with, or exercises any of its rights under, Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.4, then, that no Default or Event of Default with respect to such Borrower has occurred and is continuing at such time, such Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense to include any transfer fee payable to the Administrative Agent under Section 12.3(b) and any expense pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and in its sole discretion, require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 12.3(b)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (a) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority and (b) the Borrowers or such Eligible Assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by such assigning Lender and all other amounts owed to such assigning Lender hereunder, including amounts owed pursuant to Sections 4.1 through 4.4 hereof.

Bankruptcy
(l) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non-credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in the Credit Agreement. Further, a court may refuse to enforce a covenant if and to the extent that it deems such covenant to be violative of applicable public policy.
Equitable Principles
(m) . Whenever the phrase "to our knowledge" or "known to us" (or words of similar import) is used in this opinion letter, it means the actual knowledge of the particular McGuireWoods LLP attorneys who have represented the Borrower Parties in connection with the Credit Agreement and who have given substantive attention to the preparation and negotiation thereof. Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation (including, without limitation, conducting any review, search or investigation of any public files or records or dockets or any review of our files) to determine the existence or absence of any facts, and no inference as to our knowledge concerning such facts should be drawn from our reliance on the same in connection with the preparation and delivery of this opinion letter.
Knowledge
(n) . To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and the choice of New York forum provisions of the Credit Agreement, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen Oblig. Law 5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.

Funding of Revolving Loans
Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly inform the Lenders as to the terms thereof. Each Lender will make its share of the Revolving Loans available to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the date specified in the Notice of Borrowing by deposit (in Dollars) of immediately available funds at the offices of the Administrative Agent at its principal office in Cleveland, Ohio, or at such other address as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing.

No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder; , , that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent will make the proceeds of such Revolving Loans available to the relevant Borrower promptly after it receives funds from the Lenders as described in the preceding paragraph. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the time of any such Loan that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Loans to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Loans, and the Administrative Agent in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion without any obligation to do so) make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the relevant Borrower and such Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (a) the applicable rate for such Loan pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing, if recovered from such Borrower, and (b) the Federal Funds Rate, if recovered from a Lender.

(b) It is the intent of the Lenders and each Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrowers are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum non-usurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum non-usurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans of the relevant Borrower and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the relevant Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans of the relevant Borrower. The right to demand payment of the Loans of any Borrower or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permitted by applicable law.

Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by

repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation in Loans made to such Borrower may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

Evidence of Debt
(a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to a Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by or for the account of each Borrower from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register for each Borrower pursuant to Section 12.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Registers and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder in accordance with the documents submitted by a Borrower under Section 2.2, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
(c) The entries made in the accounts, Registers and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.9 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of each Borrower therein recorded; , however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Registers or such subaccounts, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender to such Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof.

In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any request by a Borrower for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), and (B) any request by a Borrower for conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Revolving Loans shall be deemed to be a request for conversion into or continuation of Base Rate Loans.

(A) declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender to such Borrower hereunder, whereupon any request by such Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
(B) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it to such Borrower be converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be).
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (A) or (B) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender to such Borrower or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to such Borrower shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) made by such Lender to such Borrower in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

Compensation
Each Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request, for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by the Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans to such Borrower) which such Lender may sustain:
(a) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans to such Borrower does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Competitive Bid Request to such Borrower, as the case may be;
(b) if any repayment, continuation or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan by such Borrower occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, including, without limitation, in connection with any demand, acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise (including any demand under this Section 4); or
(c) if such Borrower fails to repay its Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan when required by the terms of this Credit Agreement.
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 4.3 shall be made as though the Lender has actually funded its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America; , , that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 4.3.

The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
(j) . Our opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we do not express any opinion concerning any other law.
Applicable Law
(k) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, laws relating to preferences, fraudulent transfers and equitable subordination), reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
Bankruptcy
(l) . Our opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might limit the availability of specific equitable remedies (such as injunctive relief and the remedy of specific performance), might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of debt or exercise other remedies upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or for non-credit reasons or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants in the Credit Agreement. Further, a court may refuse to enforce a covenant if and to the extent that it deems such covenant to be violative of applicable public policy.
Equitable Principles
(m) . Whenever the phrase "to our knowledge" or "known to us" (or words of similar import) is used in this opinion letter, it means the actual knowledge of the particular McGuireWoods LLP attorneys who have represented the Borrower Parties in connection with the Credit Agreement and who have given substantive attention to the preparation and negotiation thereof. Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation (including, without limitation, conducting any review, search or investigation of any public files or records or dockets or any review of our files) to determine the existence or absence of any facts, and no inference as to our knowledge concerning such facts should be drawn from our reliance on the same in connection with the preparation and delivery of this opinion letter.
Knowledge
(n) . To the extent that any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and the choice of New York forum provisions of the Credit Agreement, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen Oblig. Law 5-1401 and 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought.

(o) . With respect to the opinions expressed in and , our opinions are limited to our review of those laws and regulations that, in our experience, are normally applicable to (i) business corporations generally, (ii) the Borrower Parties' specially regulated business activities known to us and (iii) transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement. In addition, the SCC Order will not become a final and nonappealable order until 30 days after the date of issuance, and we express no opinion with respect to the effect of an adverse decision resulting from such an appeal. However, we note that no party commented on, filed an objection to or requested a hearing with respect to the proceedings of the SCC on Virginia Electric and Power Company's application for the SCC Order.
