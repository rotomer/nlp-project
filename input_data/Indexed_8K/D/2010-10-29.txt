RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2010, of $575 million ($0.98 per share), compared to reported earnings of $594 million ($1.00 per share) for the same period in 2009.
Operating earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2010, amounted to $603 million ($1.03 per share), compared to operating earnings of $590 million ($0.99 per share) for the same period in 2009. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2010 and 2009 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the third quarter.  We achieved operating earnings near the top of our guidance range.
We continued to make significant progress on ourregulated infrastructure investment program, which is on time and on budget.  Two phases of the 500 kilovolt Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun line are complete and in operation while work continues on the remaining section of the line.  Construction on our other large electric transmission line project, the 500 kilovolt Carson-to-Suffolk line, is nearly 50 percent complete.
 
Other large infrastructure projects are proceeding on budget and according to plan.  For example, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is approximately 75 percent complete and scheduled for commercial operation in mid-2012.  Also, the Bear Garden Power Station is about 85 percent complete and is on schedule to reach commercial operations by next summer.
With a projected capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts, our proposed three-on-one, gas-fired combined-cycle facility in Warren County took another positive step toward construction and commercial operation. We have completed the steam turbine and gas turbines selection process and have executed the natural gas transportation agreement to supply fuel to the power station.  We plan to file for approval of this station with the Virginia State Corporation Commission early next year.
At Dominion Energy, we recently signed a new 15-year firm transportation agreement to move 100,000 dekatherms per day of Marcellus Shale volumes.  Also, our two major Energy construction projects, Gathering Enhancement and Cove Point Pier Expansion, remain on schedule and on budget.
Given our strong performance through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are increasing the bottom of our 2010 operating earnings guidance range.  The new 2010 operating earnings guidance is $3.30 to $3.40 per share, up from $3.25 to $3.40 per share.  The operating earnings forecast for 2011 remains unchanged at $3.00 to $3.30 per share.
Third-quarter 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
The increase in third-quarter 2010 operating earnings per share as compared to third-quarter 2009 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to favorable weather in the regulated electric service area, higher PJM ancillary service revenue, higher electric transmission revenue and rate adjustment clauses. Partially offsetting these positives were lower merchant generation margins, higher storm damage and restoration costs, and the absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys E&P operations.
Complete details of third-quarter 2010 operating earnings as compared to third-quarter 2009 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings in the range of 59 cents per share to 69 cents per share as compared to fourth-quarter 2009 operating earnings of 63 cents per share.  Positive factors for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of the prior year include higher rate adjustment clause revenue, lower planned nuclear outage expenses and a return to normal weather.  Negative factors for the quarter include lower merchant generation margins, higher income taxes and the absence of earnings resulting from the divestiture of the companys E&P operations.  Reported loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 1 cent per share.
In providing its fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 and full-year 2011 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles.  At this time, Dominion management is able to determine that the sale of substantially all of its Appalachian E&P operations resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion that will not be included in 2010 operating earnings.  Dominion management is also able to determine that the implementation of a workforce reduction program, the impairment of a merchant generation asset, the sale of Peoples Gas and the elimination of certain tax deductions associated with health care legislation changes resulted in a net after-tax loss of approximately $500 million that will not be included in 2010 operating earnings.  At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of other items on reported earnings.  Accordingly, the company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.
