2011 Annual Incentive Plan
On January 20, 2011, the Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee (CGN Committee) approved the 2011 Annual Incentive Plan (the Plan).  Under the Plan, Dominions officers are eligible for an annual performance-based cash award.  Each officer has a target incentive award under the Plan based on a percentage of base salary.  For 2011, the target percentages of base salary for Dominions named executive officers are as follows:  President and Chief Executive Officer  125%; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  100%; Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer  Dominion Virginia Power Business Unit  90%; Chief Executive Officer  Dominion Generation Business Unit  85%; and Chief Executive Officer  Dominion Energy Business Unit  85%.
The Plan is funded based on the achievement of consolidated operating earnings goals, with potential funding ranging from 0% to 200% of the target funding.  For most officers, payout of the amount funded under the Plan is subject to achievement of applicable business unit financial, safety and operating and stewardship goals.  For those Dominion officers whose compensation may be subject to the deduction limits imposed under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), payout of incentives under the Plan will be based solely on the achievement of the funding goals in order preserve the deduction of any payouts they receive under the Plan.  The CGN Committee has discretion to lower actual payouts for the named executive officers as deemed appropriate based on achievement of applicable business unit financial, safety and operating and stewardship goals established for other officers and employees, as described below.
For all officers, 5% of any funded payout is subject to the achievement of safety goals.  For all officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, another 30% of a funded payout is subject to the achievement of that officers business unit financial goal.  Certain officers have an additional 25% of their payout subject to operating and stewardship goals unique to their roles and responsibilities.
The Plan includes a provision granting the CGN Committee discretion to require repayment of payouts made to any participant who engages in fraudulent or intentional misconduct that directly causes the need for a restatement of Dominions financial statements or who engages in fraudulent or intentional misconduct related to or materially affecting the companys business operations.
2011 Long-Term Incentive Program
On January 20, 2011, the CGN Committee approved the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Program (the Program) for its officers, including its named executive officers.  The Program is being awarded pursuant to Dominions 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, and consists of two components of equal value: a restricted stock grant and a cash-based performance grant. The restricted stock is subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, while payout of the performance grant will be based on the achievement of two performance metrics: total shareholder return relative to the companys peer group (weighted 50%) and return on invested capital (weighted 50%).  Payout on the performance grant will be made by March 15, 2013, with the amount of the award to vary depending on the level of achievement of the performance metrics.  The CGN Committee retains authority to exercise negative discretion to lower payouts as it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion.  The Program includes a provision granting the CGN Committee discretion to require repayment or recovery of cash-based performance grant or restricted stock payouts made to any officer who engages in fraudulent or intentional misconduct that directly causes the need for a restatement of Dominions financial statements or who engages in fraudulent or intentional misconduct related to or materially affecting the companys business operations.
The description of the Program is a summary only and is qualified by reference to the 2011 Performance Grant Plan and form of 2011 Restricted Stock Award Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.

Binding Effect
 
EXHIBIT A
The TSR Performance will be measured based on where the Companys total shareholder return during the Performance Period ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period.  In general, Total Shareholder Return consists of the difference between the value of a share of common stock at the beginning and end of the Performance Period, plus the value of dividends paid as if reinvested in stock and other appropriate adjustments for such events as stock splits.  For purposes of TSR Performance, the total shareholder return of the Company and the Comparison Companies will be the total shareholder return as calculated by Bloomberg L.P.  As soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Period, the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies will be obtained from Bloomberg L.P. and ranked from highest to lowest.  The Companys total shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among the Comparison Companies.
The Comparison Companies are:
If a Comparison Company ceases to be a publicly traded entity, is acquired by another entity, or is merged out of existence during the Performance Period, the Comparison Company will be removed from the list of Comparison Companies.
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
 
The following terms are used to calculate ROIC for purposes of the 2011 Performance Grant:
means Total Return divided by Average Invested Capital.  Performance will be calculated for the two successive fiscal years within the Performance Period, added together and then divided by two to arrive at an annual average ROIC for the Performance Period.
ROIC
means Operating Earnings plus After-tax Interest & Related Charges, all determined for the two successive fiscal years within the Performance Period.
Total Return
means operating earnings as disclosed on the Companys earnings report furnished on Form 8-K for the applicable fiscal year.
Operating Earnings
means the Average Balances for Long & Short-term Debt plus Preferred Equity plus Common Shareholders Equity (as calculated based on the exclusion of the items described below).  The Average Balances for a year are calculated by performing the calculation at the end of each month during the fiscal year plus the last month of the prior fiscal year and then averaging those amounts over 13 months.
 Average Invested Capital
will be calculated by excluding (i) accumulated other comprehensive income (as shown on the Companys financial statements during the Performance Period); and (ii) impacts from changes in accounting principles that were not prescribed as of the Date of Grant.
Common Shareholders Equity
 

Exhibit 10.2
THIS AGREEMENT, effective as of the Date of Grant shown above, between Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia Corporation (the "Company") and the Participant named above is made pursuant and subject to the provisions of the Dominion Resources, Inc. 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan and any amendments thereto (the "Plan").  All terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Plan have the same meaning given to such terms in the Plan.
