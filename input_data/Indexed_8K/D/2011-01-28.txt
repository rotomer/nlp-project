RICHMOND, Va.  Dominion (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2010, of $2.76 billion ($4.68 per share), compared with reported earnings of $1.29 billion ($2.17 per share) for the same period in 2009.
Operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2010, amounted to $1.97 billion ($3.34 per share), compared to operating earnings of $1.94 billion ($3.27 per share) for the same period in 2009. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors.  Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2010 and 2009 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:
2010 was an extraordinary year for Dominion as we made significant progress on our strategic plan and demonstrated how our infrastructure growth plan will continue for the next five years and beyond.
In our Generation segment the majority of the projects that we announced in 2007 are now complete and two of our largest are well on their way toward coming online.  The Bear Garden Power Station, our combined cycle gas facility, is approximately 94 percent complete and will come online in the second quarter of 2011.  The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center is approximately 79 percent complete and will come online in the second quarter of 2012.   Also, in the fourth quarter, the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board unanimously approved the air permit for the Warren County Power Station.  This efficient, three-on-one combined cycle facility represents the next phase of our generation expansion plan, adding approximately 1,300 megawatts to our capacity in Virginia.  We expect to file for approval of this project with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in the spring.
Early in 2010, we announced the sale of our Appalachian E&P business for $3.475 billion, with proceeds used to offset our equity needs, invest in our pension plan and repurchase common stock.   In addition, several gas pipeline construction projects were placed in-service, including three Hub projects, which provide customers with access to natural gas supply.  Earlier this month we placed the Cove Point Pier Expansion in service.  Other major construction projects, such as Appalachian Gateway and our Gathering Expansion Project, are continuing on schedule and on budget.  Additionally, we have signed multi-year transportation service agreements to move Marcellus Shale volumes with our Northeast Expansion, Ellisburg to Craigs, and Sabinsville to Morrisville projects.
Our Dominion Virginia Power segment completed more than 400 miles of circuit reconditioning and replaced significant aging assets across our service territory. The Mount Storm to Doubs transmission line was approved by PJM Interconnection in December and we have filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission for approval.  We have completed and energized two of our new 230 kV lines, Pleasant View to Hamilton and Garrisonville.  With respect to our major electric transmission projects, Meadow Brook to Loudoun is now 98 percent complete and Carson to Suffolk is 60 percent complete. Both 500 kV lines are on track to be in-service by mid-year 2011.
We are affirming our 2011 operating earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.30 per share.  Incorporated in this guidance is the impact of the bonus depreciation provisions of the recent tax bills enacted by Congress that are expected to generate significant cash tax savings to Dominion through 2013. The company plans to use a portion of this cash benefit to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity in 2011, thereby offsetting the expected negative impact to earnings per share caused by the resulting loss of certain tax deductions and other related factors.
In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a new dividend policy that raised our target payout ratio to 60-65 percent. The Board established an annual dividend rate for 2011 of $1.97 per share of common stock, up from $1.83 per share in 2010, a 7.7 percent increase.  A first quarter dividend of 49.25 cents per share of common stock was recently declared by the Board.
Full-year 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
The increase in full-year 2010 operating earnings per share as compared to full-year 2009 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to favorable weather, share accretion, higher rate adjustment clause revenues and lower outage costs. Partially offsetting these positives were the absence of earnings from the companys E&P operations, higher income taxes and lower merchant generation margins.
 
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings per share were equivalent to fourth-quarter 2009 operating earnings per share.  Positive drivers for the quarter were favorable weather in the regulated electric service territory, higher rate adjustment clause revenue and lower outage costs.  Offsetting these positives were the absence of earnings from the companys E&P operations, a higher effective income tax rate and lower contributions from producer services.
Complete details of fourth-quarter 2010 and full-year operating earnings as compared to fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
First-quarter 2011 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects first-quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of 85 cents per share to 95 cents per share as compared to first-quarter 2010 operating earnings of 96 cents per share.  Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of the prior year include higher rate adjustment clause revenue, lower outage costs, lower storm damage and restoration costs and fewer shares outstanding.  Negative factors for the quarter include a return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from the companys E&P operations and higher interest expense.  GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were 29 cents per share.
This morning, at approximately 11:00 a.m. EST, the company will publish a detailed 2011 Guidance Kit.  The 2011 Guidance Kit will be available on Dominions website under Forecasts and Outlook at .

In providing its first-quarter and full-year 2011 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles.  At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on reported earnings.  Accordingly, the company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.
