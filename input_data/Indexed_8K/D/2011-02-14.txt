Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued an order denying a motion by Dominion Virginia Power and other interested parties to defer a required biennial rate review by one year. Following evaluation of this order on February 9, 2011, Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) concluded that it was appropriate to reverse a previously recorded reserve for potential rate credits that was included as part of Dominion Virginia Power's motion, since it is no longer probable that this motion will be accepted. This will result in an increase of $48 million or 8 cents per share to fourth-quarter and full-year 2010 reported earnings that is not included in operating earnings for 2010.
Incorporating the impact of the reversal of the reserve for potential rate credits described above, reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 is $2.81 billion ($4.76 per share), which compares with reported earnings of $1.94 billion ($2.17 per share) for the same period in 2009.
The reversal of the reserve for potential rate credits does not have an incremental impact on fourth-quarter or full-year 2010 operating earnings which Dominion reported on January 28, 2011. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion will publish on its investor information page at , a Revised 4Q 10 Earnings Release Kit, a Revised 2011 Earnings Guidance Kit and certain supplemental schedules and GAAP reconciliations incorporating the reversal of the reserve. A revised 4Q 10 Earnings Release Kit, 2010 Segment Operating Results and Supplemental Summary of 2010 Operating Earnings reflecting the adjustment to earnings are furnished with this Form 8-K as Exhibits 99.1 through 99.3, respectively.

Important Notes to Investors
This kit contains certain forward-looking statements, including forecasted operating earnings for first-quarter and full-year 2011 which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations may include factors that are beyond the company's ability to control or estimate precisely, fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, the timing of the closing dates of acquisitions or divestitures, estimates of future market conditions, access to and costs of capital, fluctuations in the value of our pension assets and assets held in our decommissioning trusts, the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned projects, acquisitions and divestitures, and the ability to complete planned construction or expansion projects as scheduled. Other factors include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes and major storms on operations, the behavior of other market participants, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments and changes to environmental and other laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, greenhouse gases and other emissions to which we are subject, economic conditions in the company's service area, risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures, changes to regulated gas and electric rates collected by Dominion, changes to rating agency requirements and ratings, changing financial accounting standards, counter-party credit risks, risks related to energy trading and marketing, adverse outcomes in litigation matters, and other uncertainties. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominion's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Certain information provided in this Release Kit includes financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including operating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, or earnings per share, and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies. Dominion has included reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures it is able to calculate and report in accordance with GAAP.
The consolidated financial data and statistics in this REVISED 4Q10 Earnings Release Kit and its individual components reflect the financial position and operating results of Dominion and its primary operating segments through December 31, 2010. Independent auditors have not audited any of the financial and operating statements. Projections or forecasts shown in this document are based on the assumptions listed in this document and are subject to change at any time. Dominion undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking information statement to reflect developments after the statement is made.
This REVISED 4Q10 Earnings Release Kit has been prepared primarily for security analysts and investors in the hope that it will serve as a convenient and useful reference document. The format of this release kit may change in the future as we continue to try to meet the needs of security analysts and investors. This release kit is not intended for use in connection with any sale, offer to sell, or solicitation of any offer to buy securities.

Earnings Report and Accompanying Schedules
Earnings Report
As of February 14, 2011, Dominion's unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2010, of $2.81 billion ($4.76 per share), compared with reported earnings of $1.29 billion ($2.17 per share) for the same period in 2009.
Operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2010, amounted to $1.97 billion ($3.34 per share), compared to operating earnings of $1.94 billion ($3.27 per share) for the same period in 2009. Operating earnings are defined as reported (GAAP) earnings adjusted for certain items.
Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power.
Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2010 and 2009 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release kit.
Full-year 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
The increase in full-year 2010 operating earnings per share as compared to full-year 2009 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to favorable weather, share accretion, higher rate adjustment clause revenues and lower outage costs. Partially offsetting these positives were the absence of earnings from the company's E&P operations, higher income taxes and lower merchant generation margins.
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings compared to 2009
Fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings per share were equivalent to fourth-quarter 2009 operating earnings per share. Positive drivers for the quarter were favorable weather in the regulated electric service territory, higher rate adjustment clause revenue
 
 
 
DOMINION  REVISED 4Q10 EARNINGS RELEASE KIT
 
and lower outage costs. Offsetting these positives were the absence of earnings from the company's E&P operations, a higher effective income tax rate and lower contributions from producer services.
Complete details of fourth-quarter 2010 and full-year operating earnings as compared to fourth-quarter and full-year 2009 can be found on Schedule 4 of this release.
First-quarter 2011 operating earnings guidance
Dominion expects first-quarter 2011 operating earnings in the range of 85 cents per share to 95 cents per share as compared to first-quarter 2010 operating earnings of 96 cents per share. Positive factors for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of the prior year include higher rate adjustment clause revenue, lower outage costs, lower storm damage and restoration costs and fewer shares outstanding. Negative factors for the quarter include a return to normal weather, lower merchant generation margins, the absence of earnings from the company's E&P operations and higher interest expense. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were 29 cents per share.
Full-year 2011 operating earnings guidance
Dominion is affirming its 2011 operating earnings guidance in the range of $3.00 to $3.30 per share. Incorporated in this guidance is the impact of the bonus depreciation provisions of the recent tax bills enacted by Congress that are expected to generate significant cash tax savings to Dominion through 2013. The company plans to use a portion of this cash benefit to repurchase $400 million to $700 million of equity in 2011, thereby offsetting the expected negative impact to earnings per share caused by the resulting loss of certain tax deductions and other related factors.
In providing its first-quarter and full-year 2011 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, of these items on reported earnings. Accordingly, the company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.
This release contains certain forward-looking statements, including forecasted operating earnings for first-quarter and full-year 2011 which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations may include factors that are beyond the company's ability to control or estimate precisely, fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, the timing of the closing dates of acquisitions or divestitures, estimates of future market conditions, access to
 
 
 
DOMINION  REVISED 4Q10 EARNINGS RELEASE KIT
 
and costs of capital, fluctuations in the value of our pension assets and assets held in our decommissioning trusts, the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned projects, acquisitions and divestitures, and the ability to complete planned construction or expansion projects as scheduled. Other factors include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes and major storms on operations, the behavior of other market participants, state and federal legislative and regulatory developments and changes to environmental and other laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, greenhouse gases and other emissions to which we are subject, economic conditions in the company's service area, risks of operating businesses in regulated industries that are subject to changing regulatory structures, changes to regulated gas and electric rates collected by Dominion, changes to rating agency requirements and ratings, changing financial accounting standards, counter-party credit risks, risks related to energy trading and marketing, adverse outcomes in litigation matters, and other uncertainties. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominion's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
