Item 8.01  Other Events
 
On September 6, 2012, Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) announced its decision to market the following merchant generation facilities for sale:
 
 
 
 
The sales are expected to be completed in the first half of 2013.
 
 
The information set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K includes certain forward-looking information, including our expectations regarding the completion and timing of the sales of the merchant generation facilities listed above. Although Dominion believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and these uncertainties may prove to be incorrect. Dominions actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties and are often beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely, such as receipt of approvals for and timing of closing dates for acquisitions and divestitures.  We have identified and will in the future identify a number of generally applicable factors in our SEC Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We refer you to those discussions for further information.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
