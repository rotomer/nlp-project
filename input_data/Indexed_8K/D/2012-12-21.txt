Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 18, 2012, the Board of Directors of Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) accepted the resignation of Dr. Frank S. Royal which was submitted in accordance with Dominions Corporate Governance Guidelines.  Dr. Royals resignation is effective December 19, 2012.
On December 17, 2012, the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee approved retention grants to Messrs. Mark F. McGettrick, Paul D. Koonce and David A. Christian, effective December 20, 2012, of 47,893, 28,736 and 28,736 shares, respectively, of restricted stock.  The grants were made pursuant to the Dominion Resources, Inc. 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan and are subject to three-year cliff vesting with all shares of restricted stock vesting on December 20, 2015 (the Vesting Date).   The restricted stock is forfeited if the executives employment with Dominion terminates for any reason prior to the Vesting Date other than for a change in control, death or disability. The shares of restricted stock are subject to vesting on a pro-rated basis in the event of a change in control, death or disability only.  Dividends will be paid on the restricted stock, but will be retained and subject to the same vesting terms as the restricted stock.  Each of the executives are required to hold any net vested shares of restricted stock for two years following the Vesting Date, to the extent the executive remains an employee of Dominion or any of its subsidiaries, and may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the net vested shares under the grant during such period.
This description of the restricted stock grants is a summary only and is qualified by reference to the Form of Restricted Stock Award Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1.
