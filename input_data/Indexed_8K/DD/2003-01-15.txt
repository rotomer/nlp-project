The registrant hereby files, pursuant to Regulation FD and in connection with Debt and/or
Equity Securities that may be offered on a delayed or continuous basis under Registration Statements on Form S-3 (No. 33-53327, No. 33-60069 and No. 333-86363), the following news release.
WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 15, 2003 -- DuPont (NYSE: DD) announced today that it
expects reported earnings for the fourth quarter 2002 to be between $.31 and $.33 per share, slightly below the company's initial outlook. The net impact of special items for the quarter is expected to be immaterial.
However, pre-tax operating results in the second half of the quarter were lower than expected.
The company expects this decline to be largely offset by a significant benefit from further reduction in the effective income tax rate for full year 2002.
DuPont will provide details on its fourth quarter and full-year 2002 results on Jan. 28, via its
fourth quarter and full-year earnings news release, Web site postings, and investor conference call.
DuPont is a 200-year-old science company offering innovative products, technologies and
services that improve the lives of people everywhere. Headquartered in Wilmington, Del., DuPont delivers science-based solutions to markets including agriculture, nutrition, electronics, communications, safety and protection, home and construction, transportation, apparel, home and textiles.
