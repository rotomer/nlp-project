Regulation FD Disclosure
          The Registrant furnishes, pursuant to Regulation FD, its earnings news release dated January 28, 2003, entitled "DuPont Reports Fourth Quarter And Full-Year 2002 Earnings," a copy of which is below.
 
Summary
Fourth quarter 2002 earnings before special items were $.34 per share compared with fourth quarter 2001 earnings of $.12. Reported earnings for fourth quarter 2002 were $.35 per share.
Segment sales for the fourth quarter were $6.3 billion up 7 percent, excluding the impact of acquired and divested businesses. This reflects 7 percent higher worldwide volumes and flat U.S. dollar prices.
Fourth quarter 2002 net income was $350 million compared with fourth quarter 2001 net income of $3,915 million, which included $3,817 million of the after-tax gain on the sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals to Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Full-year 2002 earnings per share before special items were $2.00 versus $1.19 for the year 2001. Reported earnings for the year were $1.84 per share excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
          "I am proud of what our people accomplished this year," said Charles O. Holliday, chairman and CEO. "They gained market share in our key businesses, improved our operating discipline and increased our global competitiveness."
 
Global Sales and Income
          For the quarter, consolidated sales totaled $5.7 billion compared to $5.2 billion in fourth quarter 2001. Segment sales, which include transfers and the company's pro rata share of sales by equity affiliates, were $6.3 billion versus $5.9 billion in 2001. Excluding the impact of sales attributable to acquired and divested businesses, segment sales were up 7 percent. Fourth quarter net income was $350 million, compared to $3,915 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, the latter reflecting $3,817 million of the gain on the sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals. Fourth quarter 2002 ATOI versus fourth quarter 2001 benefited from a lower full-year effective tax rate, higher sales volumes, and lower raw material costs.           For the year 2002, consolidated sales totaled $24.0 billion compared to $24.7 billion in 2001. Full-year segment sales were $26.7 billion, up 1 percent after adjusting for sales attributable to acquired and divested businesses. Full-year net income, including a $2,944 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, was a loss of $1,103 million, or $1.11 per share, versus 2001 net income of $4,339 million, or $4.16 per share, which includes a $3,866 million gain on the sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals to Bristol-Myers Squibb.

          In addition, the company will reduce stockholders' equity by approximately $2.5 billion after-tax, principally to reflect a decline in the market value of its pension assets. This adjustment does not affect cash or earnings.

          Summarized below are comments on individual segment sales and ATOI excluding special items for the fourth quarter and full-year 2002 compared to the fourth quarter and full-year 2001. Special items are detailed in the table on page 2 and in the footnotes to the financial statements. Additional segment information is available to investors and the public via the earnings data section of the DuPont Investor Web site.
Business Segment Performance
Sales of $0.7 billion were 8 percent higher reflecting 4 percent higher volume, 2 percent lower prices and 6 percent added from an acquisition. An ATOI loss of $83 million versus an ATOI loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 of $87 million, benefited from higher revenue and lower costs.
Agriculture & Nutrition
4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $4.5 billion were 5 percent higher reflecting 3 percent higher volume and a 2 percent increase due to the acquisition of Liqui-Box. ATOI was $427 million, up from $246 million in 2001, reflecting the benefit of higher seed and food ingredients sales and lower overall segment costs, the latter principally reflecting a $107 million benefit (versus prior year) from the absence of amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as required by new accounting standards.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
Sales of $1.3 billion were 7 percent higher reflecting 5 percent higher volume and 2 percent higher prices. ATOI was $136 million versus fourth quarter 2001 ATOI of $128 million.
Coatings & Color Technologies
4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $5.0 billion were 2 percent higher driven by increased sales of automotive finishes. Segment volume improved 5 percent while selling prices declined 3 percent. ATOI was $525 million compared with $498 million. The segment ATOI improvement reflects higher earnings in coatings partly offset by lower earnings in TiOproducts, the latter resulting principally from lower prices.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
2
Sales of $0.6 billion were 12 percent higher reflecting 15 percent higher volume, 5 percent lower prices and 2 percent added from portfolio changes. ATOI was $48 million compared with $49 million, essentially flat as the benefit of higher sales was offset by higher development costs.
Electronic & Communication Technologies 4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $2.5 billion were 6 percent lower reflecting 8 percent lower prices and 2 percent higher volume. Demand for many of the key products in this segment, particularly in the electronics and telecommunications markets, remained very weak. ATOI was $216 million compared with $283 million. Earnings declined in all business units reflecting lower sales and higher development costs.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
 
Sales of $1.2 billion were 7 percent higher reflecting 10 percent higher volume, 1 percent lower prices and a 2 percent reduction due to portfolio changes. ATOI was $85 million compared with $76 million, reflecting higher sales in all business units.
Performance Materials 4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $4.9 billion were 4 percent higher reflecting 8 percent higher volume and 4 percent lower prices. ATOI was $423 million compared with $277 million. 2002 earnings benefited from higher sales volumes, a lower effective tax rate, and lower energy-based raw material costs. Earnings were higher in all business units.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
Sales of $0.9 billion were 12 percent higher reflecting 10 percent higher volume, 1 percent higher prices and a 1 percent gain due to portfolio changes. ATOI was $140 million compared with $111 million. Earnings improvement reflects higher sales in all business units.
Safety & Protection 4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $3.5 billion were 3 percent lower reflecting 3 percent lower volume. ATOI was $487 million compared with $485 million. 2002 earnings reflect improved results in nonwoven products, Corian and safety consulting, more than offsetting declines in industrial chemicals and aramid products.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
Sales of $1.6 billion were 5 percent higher reflecting 4 percent volume increases and 1 percent higher prices. ATOI was $36 million compared to a loss of $11 million. Earnings results were primarily driven by volume increases in nylon and spandex products in apparel, as well as volume increases in flooring and intermediates. These volume increases more than offset negative impacts from higher raw materials costs in intermediates and other costs.
Textiles & Interiors 4Q 2002 versus 4Q 2001
Sales of $6.3 billion were 3 percent lower reflecting 5 percent higher volume, more than offset by 6 percent lower prices and a 2 percent decline due to divestitures. Price declines were attributable to the apparel and intermediates businesses. Segment ATOI was $216 million compared with $70 million in 2001. 2002 earnings benefited from reduced fixed costs reflecting restructuring programs in both years, lower energy-based raw material costs, and a lower effective tax rate.
Year 2002 versus Year 2001
          The company continues to see modest growth in many of its markets. However, in addition to the macroeconomic environment, there are two factors that influence the company's outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2003:
Outlook
 
The combined impact of pension and other postretirement expenses is expected to negatively impact 2003 earnings per share by $0.34 to $0.39, versus prior year. These are non-cash expenses.
The company estimates that its full-year base income tax rate will be 30 percent. This compares to 32.4 percent average actual base rate for the period 1998-2001. The change in estimate reflects results of a number of initiatives that have sustainably improved the company's tax position.
          Barring the occurrence of significant world events or economic disruption, the company expects 2003 first-quarter earnings per share to be roughly similar to prior-year earnings, before special items.          "Meeting our sustainable growth objectives in the first full year of our third century as a science company is extremely important to us. Every action we take will be focused on realizing that commitment to our shareholders, employees, customers and communities," Holliday said.           DuPont is a science company. Founded in 1802, DuPont puts science to work by solving problems and creating solutions that make people's lives better, safer and easier. Operating in more than 70 countries, the company offers a wide range of products and services to markets including agriculture, nutrition, electronics, communications, safety and protection, home and construction, transportation and apparel.
