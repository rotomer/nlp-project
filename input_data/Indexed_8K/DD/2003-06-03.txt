The Registrant files, pursuant to Regulation FD and in connection with Debt and/or Equity
Securities that may be offered on a delayed or continuous basis under Registration Statements on Form S-3 (No. 33-53327, No. 33-60069 and No. 333-86363), the following news release dated June 2, 2003, entitled "DuPont Announces Increase in Offer to $21.75 Indicates Final Offer."
DUPONT ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN OFFER TO $21.75INDICATES FINAL OFFER
WILMINGTON, Del., June 2, 2003 -- DuPont announced today that DCI Acquisition Inc., had
increased its offer from Cdn. $21.00 to Cdn. $21.75 per common share in cash for all the class A common shares, Series 1 of DuPont Canada not owned by DuPont or its affiliates. In connection with the increase in the offer price, the offer period has been extended to Monday, June 16, at 10:00 p.m. (Toronto time). DuPont indicated the offer was final, and that the offer period would not be further extended.
A formal Notice of Extension and Variation of the DuPont offer is expected to be mailed to
DuPont Canada's shareholders on June 3, 2003.
"Our previous (Cdn.) $21.00 offer to the minority shareholders received the unanimous support
of the independent directors comprising the Special Committee of DuPont Canada's board, and was deemed fair from a financial point of view by the Special Committee's financial advisor," said John P. Jessup, DuPont vice president and treasurer. "Our revised offer of (Cdn.) $21.75 represents a meaningful increase to what was already a full and fair offer."
On May 24, 2003, DuPont announced it had extended its offer to Monday, June 9, 2003, and
reduced the minimum condition from 90 percent to 50.1 percent of the outstanding shares not already held by DuPont and its affiliates. Approximately 23 percent of the shares not already held by DuPont and its affiliates were tendered pursuant to the offer as of the initial expiry time.
As previously announced, DuPont plans to separate DuPont Textiles & Interiors (DTI) by the
end of 2003, market conditions permitting. DuPont reaffirmed, as stated in the offering circular, that if this offer is unsuccessful DuPont intends to transfer its current share ownership interest in DuPont Canada to DuPont Textiles & Interiors. This transfer is expected to occur prior to any separation of DTI, regardless of the form of separation.
 
"The (Cdn.) $21.75 offer is final, and the expiration date of Monday, June 16, will not be
extended further," said Jessup. "We believe that the best decision for all shareholders is to take advantage of this increased offer. Whatever the outcome of the tender offer, we will proceed with our previously announced separation of DTI on the current timetable."
