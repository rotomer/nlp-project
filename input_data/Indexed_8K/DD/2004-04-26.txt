Other Events and FD Disclosure
              On November 17, 2003, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (the "company") and Koch Industries Inc. ("Koch"), announced that they had reached a definitive agreement to sell to subsidiaries of Koch substantially all of the assets of the company's Textiles & Interiors segment ("INVISTA") for $4.068 billion. In addition, Koch will assume approximately $270 million of the company's debt. In April of 2004, the company and Koch agreed to reduce the sale price from $4.068 billion to $3.828 billion. Except for three equity affiliates, this transaction is expected to be completed on April 30, 2004. The transfer of three equity affiliates will be delayed until the company receives approval from its equity partners. The company expects these affiliates will be transferred in 2004. Upon transfer of these equity affiliates, the company expects to realize a gain of approximately $77 million. This pro forma financial information assumes the transfer of these equity affiliates will be successfully completed. Upon closing, the company will indemnify Koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal matters, environmental matters and other representations and warranties. The estimated fair value of these obligations is $75 million and will be recorded when the transaction is complete.
