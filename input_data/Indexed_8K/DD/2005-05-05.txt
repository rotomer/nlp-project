               On April 30, 2004, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (the "company") completed the sale of the majority of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors, referred to as INVISTA, to subsidiaries of Koch Industries Inc. ("Koch") for $3,844 million, except for the transfer of the company's interest in certain equity affiliates. In April 2005, the company completed a transfer of its interest in an equity affiliate to Koch. As a result of this transfer, the company expects to record a gain of approximately $40 million in the second quarter 2005. The transfer of the remaining affiliates will be delayed until the company receives approval from its equity partners. Upon the transfer of the remaining equity affiliates, the company expects to realize a gain subject to adjustments related to the timing of the transfer.
               In connection with the sale, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal matters, environmental matters and representations and warranties. The fair value of these obligations is $74 million.
