               On Tuesday, May 17, 2005, DuPont was served with a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The subpoena, which was served by the Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), relates to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its salts, C8, ammonium perfluorooctanoate, and FC-143. The subpoena calls for the production of documents previously produced to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other documents related to those chemicals.
               "Consistent with our core values, DuPont is committed to operate to the highest standards of ethical behavior and environmental responsibility," said Stacey J. Mobley, senior vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel. "We will be fully responsive to the DOJ in this matter."
