Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
               On October 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (the "Company"), approved the following changes to the compensation of non-employee directors, effective January 1, 2006:
               Except as described above, the non-employee directors' compensation program will remain the same, including:
               The increase in non-employee director fees is designed to help the Company attract and retain highly qualified individuals to serve on the Company's Board and to compensate them appropriately for the commitment associated with their Board service. The levels of retainers are based on benchmarking studies prepared on behalf of the Compensation Committee by its outside consultant in respect of director fees paid by the Company's Frame of Reference Companies and director fees paid by other large public companies.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
