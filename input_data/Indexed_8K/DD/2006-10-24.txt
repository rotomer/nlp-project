     "We delivered strong results by executing our growth strategies and productivity initiatives," said Charles O. Holliday, Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive officer. "Continued pricing momentum, customer-driven product innovations, and cost control generated revenue gains, profit growth and margin expansion. We are on track for a strong second half."
Global Consolidated Net Income and Sales
     Consolidated net income for the third quarter 2006 was $485 million, or $0.52 per share including a $.03 benefit from initial insurance recoveries for prior-year hurricane damage. Net income for the third quarter 2005 was a loss of $82 million, or $.09 per share, largely due to a tax charge of $320 million, or $.32 per share, and a $95 million after-tax charge or $.10 per share for hurricane damage. Excluding significant items, earnings per share were $.49 in the third quarter 2006 compared to $.33 in the prior year.
Table of Contents
     The increase in third quarter 2006 net income principally can be attributed to higher sales volume and local selling prices, and lower fixed costs. These benefits were partly offset by the impact of higher ingredient costs.
     Consolidated net sales for the third quarter were $6.3 billion versus $5.9 billion last year, up 7 percent, with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Europe. Local selling prices were higher in every region, increasing worldwide sales 3 percent. Sales volume increased 3 percent, reflecting higher sales of titanium dioxide, engineering and packaging polymers, industrial chemicals and electronic materials. The company estimates that about 1 percentage point of worldwide volume growth can be attributed to recovery from prior year business interruptions due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Earnings Per Share
     The table below shows the variances in third quarter 2006 earnings per share (EPS) versus third quarter 2005, by major element:
Table of Contents
     Improved local pricing fully offset higher raw material costs. Fixed cost productivity, measured as a percent of sales, improved 4.2 percentage points versus last year, reflecting a $50 million year-over-year reduction in total fixed costs and a 7 percent increase in sales. After adjusting for currency and volume effects, after-tax fixed costs were $.07 per share lower than last year.
Business Segment Performance
     Segment pretax operating income (PTOI) for third quarter 2006 was $900 million versus $545 million in the prior year. Excluding a current quarter benefit of $50 million for initial insurance recoveries and prior-year charges of $146 million for hurricane damages, PTOI was $850 million versus $691 million, up 23 percent. PTOI including significant items, sales, and percentage changes versus third quarter 2005 are shown in the tables below.
     The following are summaries of third quarter 2006 performance for the business segments. Additional information on segment performance is available on the DuPont Investor Center website at .

     In the third quarter 2006, the company repurchased $100 million of its stock as part of its $5 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2005, bringing the total amount repurchased to $3.3 billion.

Outlook
     The company expects 2006 reported earnings to be about $2.86 per share, including the net benefit of $.01 per share from year-to-date significant items. Excluding significant items, the company reaffirms its full-year 2006 outlook of about $2.85 per share, which represents a 22 percent increase from the $2.34 per share earned in the prior year on the same basis.
     "We are confident we will deliver significantly higher year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter, even after adjusting for the hurricanes in 2005," Holliday said. "We are taking the right actions and continuing to invest in our exciting pipeline of new customer-driven products and technologies. Our momentum will continue into 2007 and we expect to meet our long-term financial goal of 10 percent annual growth in earnings per share."
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
     Management believes that measures of income excluding significant items ("non-GAAP" information) are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company. Such measurements are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in Schedule E.
