Item 8.01 Other Events
     On December 11, 2006, the Registrant issued a press release regarding its plan for investment and streamlining in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment. The plan is to increase investment in plant genetics, biotechnology and other high-value growth opportunities, while further improving competitiveness in low-growth areas of the company's nutrition and crop protection businesses by reducing operating costs by about $100 million a year.
     DuPont expects to reinvest all of the estimated $100 million savings in its seed business. These actions will help expand the company's competitive advantage in the seed market and increase the speed to market of seed products with next-generation biotech traits.
     DuPont will consolidate manufacturing assets, leverage technology centers and refocus product marketing strategies in its nutrition and crop protection businesses. These changes include the closing or streamlining of manufacturing units at about 10 sites and the reduction of approximately 1,500 positions globally, with most of the changes expected to be completed in 2007. In cases where redeployment is not possible, employees will receive assistance in accordance with local country and legal entity practices.
     Additionally, on December 11, 2006, the Registrant issued a press release updating its fourth quarter 2006 earnings outlook for significant items. DuPont announced that these items will be included in its fourth quarter 2006 reported earnings, providing a net benefit of approximately $370 million to net income, or $0.39 per share, and that it anticipates 2006 reported earnings per share to be about $3.25 per share.
     Based on preliminary estimates, the following items are expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter:
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
