Highlights
          "This was a strong fourth quarter for our company with improved business results across the board and strong growth outside of the United States," said Charles O. Holliday, Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive officer. "For the year, earnings per share grew 23 percent and return on invested capital increased significantly, reflecting the positive impact of executing our growth strategies and our actions to accelerate value creation. We will build on this momentum in 2007."
Global Consolidated Net Income and Sales
          Total company net income for the fourth quarter 2006 was $871 million, or $.94 per share. Fourth quarter 2005 net income was $154 million, or $.16 per share
          The increase in fourth quarter 2006 net income reflects 8 percent higher sales, flat fixed costs, significantly improved operating results in the Agriculture & Nutrition and Performance Materials platforms and recovery from the fourth quarter 2005 impact of Gulf Coast hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Table of Contents
     Fourth quarter net income included $449 million, or $.49 per share from significant items (see Schedule B), principally tax benefits realized and insurance recoveries, partly offset by charges for restructuring, an asset impairment, and adjustments having considered the provisions of the recently issued SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included a significant item benefit of $28 million or $.03 per share (see Schedule B).
     Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $6.3 billion, up 8 percent versus the fourth quarter 2005 including 2 percent higher local selling prices, and a 2 percent currency benefit. Worldwide volumes grew 4 percent, primarily from strong volume growth outside the United States reflecting higher sales of engineering and packaging polymers, elastomers, and crop protection and seed products. Volume in the United States reflects lower sales into residential construction and automotive markets, largely due to customers' efforts to reduce inventories. Global volume growth also reflects post-hurricane recovery, principally in the titanium dioxide business.
Earnings Per Share

Outlook
     The company reaffirmed its 2007 outlook of about $3.15 earnings per share. In 2007, the company expects modest volume gains as continued growth outside the United States is expected to outweigh slower growth in U.S. housing and automotive markets. Volatility in energy and ingredient costs is expected to continue, but for the full year, average costs are assumed to be about equal to 2006.
     The company will continue to advance its innovation projects, with a high priority on its differentiated bio-materials and biofuels technology platform. Additional customer-driven product launches are expected to help extend the company's three-year positive pricing trend.
      The company's 2007 cost productivity goal is to achieve savings of over $400 million to offset inflation and contribute to growth project spending. The company will continue to adjust capital and resource allocation among its businesses in an effort to further enhance return on invested capital. In addition, the company will continue implementing its previously announced restructuring programs in Coatings & Color Technologies and Agriculture & Nutrition.
     "We will build on our momentum in 2007, strengthened by the progress we have made with our productivity initiatives and growth strategies," Holliday said. "We will continue our intense focus on customer-driven product innovations and cost productivity while advancing our exciting pipeline of new products, services, and technologies."
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
     Management believes that measures of income excluding significant items ("non-GAAP" information) are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company. Such measurements are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in Schedule E.

Reconciliations of Base Income Tax Rate to Effective Income Tax Rate
The base income tax rate in the fourth quarter 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter 2005 is impacted by the regional mix of earnings, end of year full year tax rate adjustments, the effect of tax law changes in several foreign jurisdictions, tax reserve releases, and the disruptions to business suffered as a result of the Gulf Coast Hurricanes in 2005.
Net income for the full year 2006 reflects a lower than expected base tax rate because of the change in geographic mix of earnings and fruition of tax planning strategies.
