Item 7.01 Regulation FD
Note:
All dollar amounts are in millions.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company changed the alignment of certain businesses within its Agriculture & Nutrition and Performance Materials segments, and Bio-Based Materials, which is included within Other. These changes were made to better align the businesses with the growth platform that management believes will provide more opportunity for synergy and technology development in future periods. In addition, Segment sales reported by the company will no longer include a pro rata share of equity affiliates' sales. Although the company's total Pretax operating income (PTOI) in 2006 was not affected by these changes, the following segments' PTOI in 2006 were affected: Agriculture & Nutrition  increased $97; Coatings & Color Technologies  increased $22; Electronic & Communication Technologies  decreased $12; and Performance Materials  decreased $68. PTOI in 2006 for the Pharmaceuticals and Safety & Protection segments were not affected and the Pretax operating loss in 2006 for Other increased $39. These changes in management's views of segment reporting will be reflected in the company's SEC reports beginning with the first quarter 2007. The company is furnishing this report on Form 8-K to show historically reported segment information for 2006, 2005 and 2004 on a consistent basis with the presentation of segment data that will be followed beginning with the first quarter 2007. Additionally, the company's website will be updated to show historical quarterly reported segment information on a basis consistent with the 2007 presentation of segment data. The information provided in this report on Form 8-K is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor incorporated by reference in any registration statement filed by the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
The company has six reportable segments. Five of the segments constitute the company's growth platforms: Agriculture & Nutrition, Coatings & Color Technologies, Electronic & Communication Technologies, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection. The sixth segment, Pharmaceuticals, is limited to income from the company's interest in two drugs, Cozaar and Hyzaar. Beginning in 2005, financial transactions related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors are included in Other.
Major products by segment include: Agriculture & Nutrition (hybrid seed corn and soybean seed, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, value enhanced grains and soy protein); Coatings & Color Technologies (automotive finishes, industrial coatings and white pigments); Electronic & Communication Technologies (fluorochemicals, fluoropolymers, photopolymers and electronic materials); Performance Materials (engineering polymers, packaging and industrial polymers, films and elastomers); Pharmaceuticals (representing the company's interest in the collaboration relating to Cozaar/Hyzaar antihypertensive drugs, which is reported as Other income); and Safety & Protection (specialty and industrial chemicals, nonwovens, aramids and solid surfaces). The company operates globally in substantially all of its product lines.
In general, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Exceptions are noted as follows and are shown in the reconciliations below. Segment Pretax operating income and Segment net assets for 2005 and 2006 include the company's retrospective adoption of FSP AUG AIR-1, relating to planned major maintenance activities, effective January 1, 2005. Additional details regarding this change can be found in Note 1 in the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Segment sales include transfers. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment Pretax operating income is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses, interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Segment net assets includes net working capital, net permanent investment and other noncurrent operating assets and liabilities of the segment. Affiliate net assets (pro rata share) excludes borrowing and other long-term liabilities. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on research and development facilities and amortization of other intangible assets, excluding write-down of assets which is discussed in Note 5 in the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Expenditures for long-lived assets exclude Investments in affiliates and include payments for Property, plant and equipment as part of business acquisitions (see Note 24 in the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K).
