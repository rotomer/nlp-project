Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On January 8, 2008, the company recorded an impairment charge of $165 million ($135 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter 2007. The impairment charge is to write down the company's investment in a polyester films joint venture in the Performance Materials segment. Also, the company recorded on its financial statements certain venture cash obligations which the company had previously guaranteed. The impairment resulted from several factors, including adverse changes in market conditions and the rapid rise in oil-related raw materials costs, which have had a negative impact on the profitability of the venture's operations in North America and Europe.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
