At a meeting held September 19, 2008, the Board of Directors of E. I. du Pont de Nemours ("Company") took the following actions:
Mr. Holliday will remain employed by the Company in the role of Chairman for a period of transition after which it is anticipated that Ms. Kullman will become Chairman of the Board.
Ms. Kullman joined DuPont in 1988 as marketing manager and progressed through various roles as global business director and was named vice president and general manager of White Pigment & Mineral Products in 1995. In 2000, Ms. Kullman was named group vice president and general manager of several businesses and new business development. She became group vice president-DuPont Safety & Protection in 2002. In June 2006, Ms. Kullman was named Executive Vice President, the position she currently holds, and assumed leadership of Marketing & Sales along with Safety and Sustainability. In March 2008, Ms. Kullman assumed overall leadership for the company's actions to drive aggressive growth in international markets. Ms. Kullman is a member of the board of directors of General Motors Corporation.
The spouse of Ms. Kullman is Director-Corporate Marketing at DuPont and received total compensation in 2007 valued at $340,000, which is commensurate with that of his peers. It is anticipated that Mr. Kullman's total compensation for 2008 will be comparable to his 2007 total compensation.
The Board approved an increase in Ms. Kullman's annual salary from $665,000 to $900,000, effective October 1, 2008, to reflect her appointment as President as of that date. The Board also approved an increase in Ms. Kullman's annual salary from $900,000 to $1,200,000 effective January 1, 2009 to reflect her appointment as CEO as of that date.
Management recommends and the Compensation Committee approves short-term incentive targets for all participants, including the President, principal financial officer and other named executive officers of the Company, based on an evaluation of market medians. The Board of Directors approved a target short-term incentive award for 2008 for Ms. Kullman under the Company's EIP in the amount of $819,450, which is prorated to reflect nine (9) months in her current position and three (3) months as President.
