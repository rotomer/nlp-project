Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
     On May 5, 2009, in response to the protracted global economic recession, DuPont committed to an initiative to address the steep and extended downturn in transportation and construction markets, and the extension into industrial markets. The plan is designed to restructure asset and fixed cost bases primarily in the Coatings & Color Technologies, Electronics & Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, and Safety & Protection segments in order to maintain long-term competitiveness and maximize pretax operating income. The program will result in one-time pretax charges to earnings of $340 million to $390 million in the second quarter 2009, comprised of about $225 million of severance and related benefits costs and about $145 million primarily related to asset write-offs. DuPont expects to incur approximately $35 million of other costs, the majority of which will be incurred during the remainder of 2009 and 2010, primarily related to dismantlement and removal costs and accelerated depreciation associated with implementation of the plan. Future cash expenditures are anticipated to be $230 million to $260 million related to this initiative, comprised of about $225 million for the payment of severance and related benefits and about $25 million primarily related to dismantlement and removal costs.
     Under the plan, DuPont will eliminate about 2,000 positions by severance and expects this initiative to be substantially complete in 2010.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
