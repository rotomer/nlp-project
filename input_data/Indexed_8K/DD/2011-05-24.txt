On May 19, 2011, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, DuPont Denmark Holding ApS (the "Acquisition Subsidiary"), completed the acquisition of approximately 92.2% of the outstanding shares of Danisco A/S ("Danisco") pursuant to a previously announced tender offer for all of Danisco's outstanding shares, excluding treasury shares, at a price of DKK 700 in cash per share. Total consideration paid for the acquired shares was about $6 billion, not including net debt of Danisco. Since more than 90% of Danisco's outstanding shares were tendered, the remaining outstanding shares are in the process of being acquired through a compulsory acquisition procedure in accordance with Danish law. This procedure is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2011, at which point DuPont will own, through its Acquisition Subsidiary, 100% of Danisco's shares.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
