Item 1.01    
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 30, 2012, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ("DuPont") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company (the "Buyer").  The Buyer was formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (the "Sponsor").  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer has agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the DuPont Performance Coatings business (the "Business") for $4.9 billion in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities of the Business, including approximately $250 million of unfunded pension liabilities (the "Transaction").  The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each party, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct by DuPont of the Business during the interim period between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the completion of the Transaction (the "Closing") and certain actions DuPont agrees not to take during such interim period.
The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of required clearances from the European Commission and certain other governmental antitrust authorities, (2) the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, writ, judgment, preliminary or permanent injunction or restraining order prohibiting or restricting the consummation of the Transaction and (3) the absence of any change, event, circumstance, development or effect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a "Material Adverse Effect" (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).  Each party's obligation to consummate the Transaction is also subject to (x) the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties contained in the Purchase Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers) and (y) the other party's performance and compliance in all material respects with its obligations and covenants required by the Purchase Agreement.
DuPont and the Buyer have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Transaction to be consummated.  However, the Purchase Agreement also includes certain termination provisions in favor of both DuPont, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.  A termination of the Purchase Agreement by DuPont under certain specified circumstances, including a material breach by the Buyer that causes certain of the closing conditions not to be satisfied or a failure by the Buyer to consummate the Transaction if all of the conditions to the obligation of the Buyer to close the Transaction have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), will entitle DuPont to receive from the Buyer a reverse termination fee equal to $330,750,000. Each of DuPont and the Buyer also has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement if the Closing has not occurred on or before May 1, 2013.
The Buyer has obtained equity commitments from certain affiliates of the Sponsor and debt financing commitments from Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,  Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC, UBS Loan Finance LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Jeffries Finance LLC. The obligations of the Buyer pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are not conditioned on receipt of this financing; however, the Buyer is not required to consummate the Transaction until after the completion of a 15-business day "Marketing Period" (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), which shall not commence prior to January 4, 2013, and if the Marketing Period has not commenced on or prior to January 22, 2013, Buyer has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement for ten (10) business days thereafter.
 
 
 
 
Certain affiliates of the Sponsor have also agreed to guarantee certain obligations of the Buyer under the Purchase Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in their limited guarantees in favor of DuPont, dated August 30, 2012, which guarantees cover the payment of certain monetary obligations that may be owed by the Buyer pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, including any reverse termination fee and reimbursement obligations that may become payable by the Buyer.
Both DuPont and the Buyer have agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising from certain breaches of the Purchase Agreement and for certain other liabilities, subject to certain limitations. In connection with the Transaction, DuPont and the Buyer (or entities that it will acquire in the Transaction) also will enter into certain additional ancillary agreements, including transition services agreements, an intellectual property license agreement and certain other commercial agreements.
A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing summary of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Purchase Agreement.
The representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been made only for the purposes of the Purchase Agreement and solely for the benefit of the parties thereto and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts. In addition, such representations and warranties were made only as of the dates specified in the Purchase Agreement and information regarding the subject matter thereof may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding its terms and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding DuPont or its business as of the date of the Purchase Agreement or as of any other date.

(a)         Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, other than the obligations expressly set forth in this Section 5.21, DuPont, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives have no responsibility for any financing that Buyer may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each of Buyer and DuPont acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is not subject to a financing condition under Article VII or otherwise.

77
 
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or such lesser amount as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and make the payments contemplated by the Required Amount).  Buyer shall keep DuPont reasonably informed of material developments in respect of Buyer's efforts to arrange the Financing.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give DuPont prompt notice (A) of any breach or default by any party under the Financing Commitments of which Buyer becomes aware, (B) of the receipt or delivery of any written notice or other written communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment related to the Financing or (y) any material dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the Financing Commitments with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing and (C) if at any time for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments; , that, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event will Buyer be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege.  Buyer shall promptly, and in any event within five days after DuPont delivers a written request to Buyer, provide any information reasonably requested by DuPont relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence.  Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of DuPont, Buyer shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Financing Commitments to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would (1) reduce the aggregate amount to be funded under the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees), unless, in the case of a reduction in the aggregate amount to be funded under the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (2) amend, modify or supplement the conditions or contingencies to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make it less likely the Financing will be funded or imposes new or additional conditions or expands any existing condition to the receipt of the Financing or (3) adversely affect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or any definitive agreements with respect thereto or otherwise would reasonably be expected to delay funding of the Financing or make funding of the Financing less likely to occur.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the addition of such additional parties and amendment of additional terms do not impact the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing or, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the Closing and would not have affected the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.7 if such amendments had been reflected in the Debt Commitment Letters as originally executed.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has not been consummated on or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of the bridge facilities

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) to fund the Preliminary Purchase Price to be available and to be used to replace such high yield financing sufficiently in advance to allow the Closing to occur when it would be scheduled to occur pursuant to Section 2.2(a).  In addition, Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including taking all actions necessary to (I) maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (II) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in such Equity Commitment Letter that are within its control, if any, (III) subject to the satisfaction of any conditions to funding set forth therein, consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the Closing and (IV) enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

The Indemnifying Party's decision to allow the Indemnified Party to take the lead with respect to any indemnity obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such indemnity obligation, and if an Indemnified Party settles a Third Party Claim it is defending pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)(ii) without obtaining the Indemnifying Party's written consent to such settlement in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed such consent.

The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure.  If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

For the avoidance of doubt, if a Plant Expansion Activity reveals a non-compliance with Environmental Law that would otherwise be a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability, any Losses from such non-compliance will be subject to indemnification by DuPont as a Pre-Closing Environmental Liability, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.  However, if any Plant Expansion Activity results in a non-compliance with Environmental Law that was not a non-compliance prior to such Plant Expansion Activity, any Losses to the extent resulting therefrom will not be subject to indemnification.

DuPont's decision to allow Buyer to take the lead with respect to any indemnity obligation of DuPont shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect DuPont's obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to any such indemnity obligation of DuPont.  Buyer shall promptly provide copies to DuPont of all material notices, correspondence and all reports related to such matter, and shall also provide other related non-privileged documents to DuPont upon request provided, however, that any otherwise privileged documents that would be protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege agreement between the parties shall be provided to DuPont upon request.

To obtain such consent, Buyer shall provide prior DuPont written notice of such matter and a reasonable opportunity to evaluate such matter and the parties shall cooperate in a timely manner to determine whether such a legal obligation exists. If Buyer fails to provide such prior written notice and reasonable opportunity to evaluate such matter, then DuPont shall be relieved of its indemnification obligations with respect to such reported matter. If DuPont grants its consent to report any matter, DuPont shall have the right to participate in any discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to such matter and control the defense of the matter to the extent provided in Section 8.4(j)(iv).

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.  The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, DuPont shall be entitled to seek or obtain any injunction, specific performance or any other equitable relief requiring Buyer to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, to specifically enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter or to cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if and only if: (i) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 have been satisfied as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be
