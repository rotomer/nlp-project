DuPont will report its third quarter 2012 results on October 23, 2012. As a result of the planned DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC) divestiture that was announced on August 30, 2012, DuPont will report its third quarter results on a continuing operations basis, excluding DPC. To assist investors with this new presentation, below is a breakdown of earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations and discontinued operations, excluding significant items, for the first and second quarters 2012:
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Management believes that certain non-GAAP measurements are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company. Such measurements are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in Schedule A.
Included above and incorporated by reference herein is DuPont's breakdown of earnings per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations, excluding significant items, for the first and second quarters 2012.
