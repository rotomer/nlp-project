Directors, (ii) by any person or persons authorized to do so by the Board or (iii) by any stockholder of the Company entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3. Such nomination, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board or by persons authorized by the Board, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. Such stockholder's notice to the Secretary of a proposed nomination shall set forth, as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are beneficially owned by the person, and (iv) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as now or hereafter amended; such notice shall further set forth, as to the stockholder giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by such stockholder.

If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
 
To be properly brought before any annual or special meeting of stockholders, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company.

If the Chairman of the meeting determines that such business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedure, he shall so declare to the meeting, any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
