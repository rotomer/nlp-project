This change of classification appears in the Form 10-Q the Company filed today for its first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2005.  The change is related to comments from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") and is consistent with the Commission staff's position articulated in a February 14, 2005 posting on the Commission's website.  Further, the change had no impact on the Company's net income, total cash flows or cash and liquidity position.
