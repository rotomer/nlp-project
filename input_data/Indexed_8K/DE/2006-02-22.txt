JOHN DEERE OMNIBUS EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN
 
 
Article I:  General
 
1.1
                                
Purpose
 
Deere & Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), hereby adopts, subject to stockholder approval, this plan which shall be known as the JOHN DEERE OMNIBUS EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (the "Plan"). The Corporation and its Subsidiaries are severally and collectively referred to hereinafter as the "Company." The purpose of the Plan is to foster and promote the long-term financial success of the Company and materially increase stockholder value by: (a) strengthening the Company's capability to develop, maintain, and direct an outstanding employee team; (b) motivating superior performance by means of long-term performance related incentives; (c) encouraging and providing for obtaining an ownership interest in the Company; (d) attracting and retaining outstanding talent by providing incentive compensation opportunities competitive with other major companies; and (e) enabling eligible employees to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company.
 
1.2
                                
Administration
 
The Plan shall be administered by and under the direction of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation or such other committee of directors as is designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Committee"), which shall consist of two or more members. The members shall be appointed by the Board of Directors, and any vacancy on the Committee shall be filled by the Board of Directors.
(a)
                                 
 
Subject to the limitations of the Plan, the Committee shall have the sole and complete authority to: (i) select from eligible employees of the Company, those who shall participate in the Plan (a "Participant" or "Participants"); (ii) make awards in such forms and amounts as it shall determine; (iii) impose such limitations, restrictions and conditions upon such awards as it shall deem appropriate; (iv) interpret the Plan and adopt, amend, and rescind administrative guidelines and other rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (v) correct any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Plan or in any award granted hereunder; and (vi) make all other determinations and take all other actions deemed necessary or advisable for the implementation and administration of the Plan. The Committee's determinations on matters within its authority shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and all other persons.
(b)
                                
 
Except as provided below, the Committee may, to the extent that any such action will not prevent the Plan from complying with Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or any similar rule which may subsequently be in effect ("Rule 16b-3"), the outside director requirement of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time (the "Code"), the rules of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to companies listed for trading thereon or any other law, delegate any of its authority hereunder to such persons as it deems appropriate. The Committee shall not delegate its authority to amend, suspend or terminate the Plan.
(c)
                                 
The provisions of this Plan are intended to qualify awards made to certain Participants (hereinafter identified as "Covered Participants") under the Plan under the "performance-based" exception to the Code Section 162(m) deduction limitation.
(d)
                                
 
1.3
                                
Types of Awards Under the Plan
 
Awards under the Plan may be in the form of any one or more of the following: (a) Statutory stock options ("ISOs", which term shall be deemed to include Incentive Stock Options as defined in Section 2.5 and any future type of tax-qualified option which may subsequently be authorized), Non-statutory Stock Options ("NSOs" and, collectively with ISOs, "Options"), and Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") as described in Article II; (b) Performance Units and Performance Shares ("Performance Units" and "Performance Shares") as described in Article III; (c) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Equivalents ("Restricted Stock" and "Restricted Stock Equivalents") as described in Article IV; (d) Other Awards ("Other Awards") as described in Article V; and (e) Substitute Awards as defined in Article IX (collectively, "Awards").
 
1.4
                                
Shares Subject to the Plan
 
Shares of stock covered by Awards under the Plan may be in whole or in part authorized and unissued or treasury shares of the Corporation's common stock, $1.00 par value per share, or such other shares as may be substituted pursuant to Section 1.6 ("Common Stock").
(a)
                                 
 
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be awarded for all purposes under the Plan shall be the aggregate of:
(b)
                                
 
26,750,000 shares;
(i)
                                    
 
the number of shares previously authorized but not reserved as of the date the Plan is approved for awards under the John Deere Equity Incentive Plan, the John Deere Restricted Stock Plan and the 1991 John Deere Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Prior Plans"); and
(ii)
                                 
 
any shares corresponding to awards under the Prior Plans that are forfeited after the date the Plan is approved.
(iii)
                              
 
Effective for awards made after February 22, 2006, awards of Performance Awards, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Equivalents, Other Awards and Substitute Awards shall reduce the maximum number of available authorized shares of Common Stock under the Plan by 2.5 shares for each share awarded.  Awards of Options and SARS shall reduce the maximum number of available authorized shares of Common Stock under the Plan by one share for each share awarded.  The full number of SARs granted that are settled by the issuance of shares shall be counted against the number of shares available for award under the Plan, regardless of the number of shares actually issued upon settlement of such SARs.
(c)
                                 
 
Any shares of Common Stock subject to an Option which for any reason is canceled (excluding shares subject to an Option canceled upon the exercise of a related SAR to the extent shares are issued upon exercise of such SAR) or terminated without having been exercised; or any shares corresponding to other Awards under the Plan, which are forfeited before delivery of such shares, shall again be available for Awards under the Plan.
(d)
                                
No fractional shares shall be issued, and the Committee shall determine the manner in which fractional share value shall be treated.
(e)
                                 
 
1.5
                                
Maximum Awards Per Participant
 
The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (including any cash equivalents thereof) that may be subject to Options and SARs awarded during any fiscal year to a Covered Participant shall not exceed .5% of the number of shares outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Corporation.
(a)
                                 
 
The aggregate number of (i) all Performance Units and Performance Shares and (ii) all Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Equivalents; (iii) all Other Awards; and (iv) all Substitute Awards, awarded to a Covered Participant in any fiscal year shall not exceed the equivalent of 300,000 shares or the cash equivalent thereof (based on the Fair Market Value of Common Stock as of the date of the Award).
(b)
                                
 
1.6
                                
Adjustments Upon Certain Changes
 
In the event of a stock dividend or stock split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares or other increase or reduction in the number of issued shares of Common Stock, the Board of Directors or the Committee may, in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of rights under Awards (including Deferred Amounts), make such adjustments in the number and type of shares authorized by this Plan, the number and type of shares covered by, or with respect to which payments are measured under, outstanding Awards and the exercise prices specified therein as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable.
 
1.7
                                
Eligible Participants
 
Participants shall be selected by the Committee from salaried employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries.
 
Article II:  Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
 
2.1
                                
Award of Stock Options
 
The Committee may, from time to time, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe, award to any Participant ISOs and NSOs to purchase Common Stock.
 
2.2
                                
Documentation of Stock Option Awards
 
The award of an Option may be evidenced by a signed written agreement (a "Stock Option Agreement"), a certificate or an electronic record containing such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time determine.
 
2.3
                                
Option Price
 
The purchase price of Common Stock under each Option (the "Option Price") shall be fixed by the Committee and except for Substitute Awards, shall be not less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Option is awarded. Subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 1.6, the Option Price fixed by the Committee of outstanding Options shall not be modified.
2.4
                                
Exercise and Term of Options
 
Options awarded under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall approve, either at the time of grant of such Options or pursuant to a general determination, and which need not be the same for all Participants, provided that no such Option (other than Substitute Awards) shall be exercisable within the first six months of its term (except in the event of the death of the Participant in which event Section 2.8(b) shall control without regard to the six-month or other holding period requirements) and the term of each Option shall not extend later than ten years after the date of grant of the Option. Each Option which is intended to qualify as an ISO pursuant to Section 422 of the Code, and each Option which is intended to qualify as another type of ISO which may subsequently be authorized by law, shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Code pertaining to such Options.
(a)
                                 
 
The Committee shall establish procedures governing the exercise of Options and shall require that written notice of exercise be given and that the Option Price be paid in full in cash (including check, bank draft or money order) at the time of exercise; provided, however, the Participant may instruct the Corporation to sell shares delivered on exercise as the Participant's agent pursuant to a "cashless exercise" program or other similar program established or recognized by the Committee. The Committee may permit a Participant, in lieu of part or all of the cash payment, to make payment in Common Stock already owned by that Participant, valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, as partial or full payment of the Option Price; provided, however, that the Committee may, in any instance, in order to prevent any possible violation of law, require the Option Price to be paid in cash. As soon as practicable after receipt of each notice and full payment, the Company shall deliver to the Participant a certificate or certificates representing the acquired shares of Common Stock. The exercise of an Option shall cancel any related SAR to the extent of the number of shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(b)
                                
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of Participants who at the time of award, vesting or exercise of Options are located in a jurisdiction that would but for this Section 2.4(c) subject such Options to tax prior to exercise, any exercise shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Director, Compensation and Benefits or an officer of the Corporation. Such approval shall be at the sole discretion of the Director, Compensation and Benefits or the officer. If and when granted, such approval will constitute the notice to the Corporation referred to above in Section 2.4(b).
(c)
                                 
 
2.5
                                
Limitations on ISOs
 
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent required from time to time by the Code, the following additional provisions shall apply to the grant of Options which are intended to qualify as ISOs (as such term is defined in Section 422 of the Code):
 
The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the Option is granted) of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) shall not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may subsequently be specified by the Code; provided that, to the extent that such limitation is exceeded, any excess Options (as determined under the Code) shall be deemed to be NSOs.
(a)
                                 
 
Any ISO authorized under the Plan shall contain such other provisions as the Committee shall deem advisable, but shall in all events be consistent with and contain or be deemed to contain all provisions required in order to qualify the Options as ISOs.
(b)
                                
All ISOs must be granted within ten years from the earlier of the date on which this Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors or the date this Plan was approved by the stockholders.
(c)
                                 
 
Unless sooner exercised, terminated, or canceled, all ISOs shall expire no later than ten years after the date of grant.
(d)
                                
 
2.6
                                
Loans
 
The Committee may provide for the Corporation or any Subsidiary to make loans to finance the exercise of any Option as well as the estimated or actual amount of any taxes payable by the holder as a result of the exercise or payment of any Option and may prescribe, or may empower the Corporation or such Subsidiary to prescribe, the other terms and conditions.
 
2.7
                                
Award of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
An SAR is a right to receive, without payment (except for applicable withholding taxes) to the Company, a number of shares of Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof, the amount of which is determined pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 2.7(e). An SAR may be granted (i) with respect to any Option granted under this Plan, either concurrently with the grant of such Option, or at such later time as determined by the Committee (as to all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option); or (ii) alone, without reference to any related stock option. Each SAR granted by the Committee under this Plan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Section.
(a)
                                 
General.
 
Each SAR granted to any Participant shall relate to such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be determined by the Committee, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.6. In the case of an SAR granted with respect to a stock option, the number of shares of Common Stock to which the SAR pertains shall be reduced in the same proportion that the holder of the option exercises the related stock option.
(b)
                                
Number.
 
The term of each SAR shall be determined by the Committee but in no event shall an SAR (other than a Substitute Award) be exercisable during the first six months of its term and the term of each SAR shall not extend later than ten years after the date of grant of the SAR. Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise provided by the Committee, each SAR shall become exercisable at such time or times, to such extent and upon such conditions as the stock option, if any, to which it relates is exercisable.
(c)
                                 
Duration.
 
An SAR may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice to the Company, specifying the number of SARs which the holder wishes to exercise. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Company shall, within 90 days thereafter, deliver to the exercising holder a certificate for the shares of Common Stock or cash or both, as determined by the Committee, to which the holder is entitled.
(d)
                                
Exercise.
 
Subject to the right of the Committee to deliver cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable upon the exercise of an SAR shall be determined by dividing:
(e)
                                 
Payment.
 
the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the SAR is exercised multiplied by the amount of the appreciation in such shares (for this purpose, the "appreciation" shall be the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a share of common Stock subject to the SAR on the exercise date exceeds (A) in the case of an SAR related to a stock option, the
(i)
                                    
purchase price of a share of Common Stock under the stock option or (B) in the case of an SAR granted alone, without reference to a related stock option, an amount which shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant, provided, however, such amount is at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the SAR is awarded, (subject to adjustment under Section 1.6); by
 
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date.
(ii)
                                 
 
In lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an SAR, the Committee may elect to pay the holder of the SAR cash equal to the appreciation (such appreciation to be determined as set forth in Section 2.7(e)(i) above) on the exercise date of any or all of the shares which would otherwise be issuable. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the exercise of an SAR; instead, the holder of the SAR shall be entitled to receive a cash adjustment equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date.
 
SARs awarded under the Plan may be evidenced by either a signed written agreement, a certificate or an electronic record containing such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time determine.
(f)
                                   
Documentation of SAR Awards.
 
2.8
                                
Termination of Employment
 
In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company with the consent of the Committee or upon the Participant's death, or retirement or disability pursuant to applicable disability or retirement plans of the Company, each of the Participant's outstanding Options and SARs shall be exercisable by the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or designated beneficiary), subject to the vesting requirements of the Options and SARs, at any time prior to an expiration date established by the Committee at the time of award (which may be the original expiration date of such Option or such earlier time as the Committee may establish) or as set forth in Section 2.8(b) or (c), but in no event after its respective expiration date. If the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company for any other reason and without such consent, all of the Participant's then outstanding Options and SARs shall terminate immediately.
(a)
                                 
 
Unless the Committee establishes otherwise at the time of the Award, in the event of termination of employment because of death, the Participant's outstanding Options and SARs may be exercised by the heirs, legatees or legal representatives of the holder, as the case may be, within twelve months after such death. Such exercise shall be upon the same terms at the time of exercise as would have been available to the original holder, had he or she remained in the continuous employ of the Company, except that such heirs, legatees or legal representatives may exercise any Options and SARs held at the date of such holder's death without regard to the holding period established pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or 2.7(c) above.
(b)
                                
 
Unless the Committee establishes otherwise at the time of the Award, in the event of termination of employment of the holder of an Option or SAR with the consent of the Committee or because of disability or retirement pursuant to applicable disability or retirement plans of the Company, an Option or SAR may be exercised by such holder, within five years after such termination, to the same extent and upon the same terms (including among other things, the holding period requirement established pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or 2.7(c) above) at the time of exercise as would have been available had such holder remained in the continuous employ of the Company. In the event of the death of such holder of an Option or SAR prior to the expiration of the five-year period specified in the preceding sentence, an Option or SAR held at death by such holder may be exercised by the holder's heirs, legatees or legal representatives, as the case may be, (without regard to the holding period requirement established pursuant to
Section 2.4(a) or 2.7(c) above) within one year after death or within five years following such termination, whichever is later, but only if and to the extent the Option or SAR would have been exercisable by the retired holder of the option at the date of death.
 
In the event of a termination of employment by the Company of a Participant with the consent of the Committee or because of the Participant's death, retirement or disability pursuant to applicable disability or retirement plans of the Company, the Committee in its sole discretion may elect to accelerate the date on which certain of the Options and SARs issued to such Participant become exercisable, which acceleration may be conditioned on the forfeiture of other Awards issued to such Participant. It is expressly provided, however, that no such acceleration may permit the exercise of any Option or SAR in less than six months from the date of grant, nor represent a material increase in benefits.
(c)
                                 
 
Nothing in Section 2.8(b) and 2.8(c) shall make an Option or SAR exercisable after the stated expiration date of such Option or SAR.
(d)
                                
 
Article III:  Performance Shares and Units
 
3.1
                                
Award of Performance Units and Performance Shares
 
The Committee may award to any Participant Performance Shares and Performance Units ("Performance Awards"). Each Performance Share shall represent one share of Common Stock. Each Performance Unit shall represent the right of a Participant to receive an amount equal to the value determined in the manner established by the Committee at the time of award, which value may, without limitation, be equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock.
 
3.2
                                
Documentation of Performance Awards
 
Each Performance Award under the Plan may be evidenced by a signed written agreement, a certificate or an electronic record containing such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time determine. Performance Shares shall be held by the Corporation while subject to performance targets. Except for restrictions on transfer, the Participant as owner of such Performance Shares shall have all the rights of a holder of Common Stock.
 
3.3
                                
Performance Period and Targets
 
The performance period for each award of Performance Shares and Performance Units shall be of such duration as the Committee shall establish at the time of award; provided, however, that in no event will the performance period be less than one year (the "Performance Period"). There may be more than one award in existence at any one time and Performance Periods may differ.
(a)
                                 
 
The Committee shall set performance targets relating to Performance Units and Performance Shares which shall be based on one or more of the following performance measures, or any combination of the following: (i) total stockholder return; (ii) growth in revenues, sales, settlements, market share, customer conversion, net income, stock price, and/or earnings per share; (iii) return on assets, net assets, and/or capital; (iv) return on stockholders' equity; (v) economic value added; (vi) improvements in costs and/or expenses; or (vii) any similar performance measure established by the Committee. Such performance targets shall be established in writing by the Committee no later than the earlier of (i) 90 days after the commencement of the Performance Period with respect to which the award of Performance Units or Performance Shares is made and (ii) the date as of which twenty-five percent (25%) of such Performance Period has elapsed. For purposes of establishing performance targets, any of
(b)
                                
the factors set forth above may, as applicable, be measured either before or after income taxes, and on a corporate, division, subsidiary or individual basis, and may include or exclude interest, depreciation and amortization, goodwill, extraordinary items and other material non-recurring gains or losses, discontinued or added operations, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting policies and the effect of any tax law changes. At the time of setting performance targets, the Committee shall establish minimum, target and maximum performance targets to be achieved within the Performance Period. Failure to meet the minimum performance target will earn no Performance Award. Performance Awards will be earned as determined by the Committee in respect of a Performance Period in relation to the degree of attainment of performance between the minimum and maximum performance targets.
 
If the Committee shall determine that an acquisition or disposition of assets or securities by the Company shall have a material effect (whether positive or negative) on the Company's ability to meet its performance target(s) for the applicable Performance Period(s), the Committee shall have the discretion to take any action that would reduce the amount of an Award, or to adjust a performance target for a Performance Period, subject to the limitations of Section 162(m).
(c)
                                 
 
Except as provided in Section 3.3(c) above, once established performance targets for Awards to Covered Participants shall not be changed during the Performance Period; provided, however, that the Committee retains the discretion to eliminate or decrease the amount of an Award otherwise payable to any Participant.
(d)
                                
 
3.4
                                
Payment Respecting Performance Awards
 
Performance Awards shall be earned to the extent that their terms and conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Performance Awards shall be payable to the Participant only in accordance with the terms thereof or otherwise when, if, and to the extent that the Committee determines to make such payment. All payment determinations shall be made by the Committee during the first four months following the end of the Performance Period.  Anything in the preceding two sentences to the contrary notwithstanding and subject to Section 3.4(b) below, all payments under a Performance Award shall be made no later than (i) the 15 day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the applicable Performance Period ends or (ii) the 15 day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year in which the applicable Performance Period ends, whichever is later.

Article IV:  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Equivalents
 
4.1
                                
Award of Restricted Stock
 
The Committee may award to any Participant shares of Common Stock, subject to this Article IV and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe (such shares being herein called "Restricted Stock"). Restricted Stock shall be held by the Corporation while subject to restrictions. As restrictions lapse the shares will be delivered to the Participant.
 
4.2
                                
Documentation of Restricted Stock Awards
 
Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Equivalents under the Plan may be evidenced by a signed written agreement, a certificate or an electronic record containing such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time determine.
 
4.3
                                
Restriction Period
 
At the time of award there shall be established for each Participant, subject to Section 4.6, a restriction period (the "Restriction Period") which shall lapse (a) upon the completion of a period of time ("Time Goal") as shall be determined by the Committee, or (b) upon the achievement of stock price goals within certain time limitations ("Price/Time Goal") as shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that, except for maximum aggregate Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Equivalent awards of 5% of the aggregate shares authorized by Section 1.4(b), the Restriction Period on awards with a Price/Time Goal shall not be less than one year and the Restriction Period on awards with only a Time Goal shall not be less than three years. Except for restrictions on transfer, the Participant as owner of such shares of Restricted Stock shall have all the rights of a holder of Common Stock. With respect to shares of Restricted Stock which are issued subject to a Time Goal, the Corporation shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or designated beneficiary) the certificates at the expiration of the Restriction Period. With respect to shares of Restricted Stock which are issued subject to a Price/Time Goal, the Corporation shall deliver to the Participant (or, if applicable pursuant to Section 4.4 to the Participant's legal representative or designated beneficiary) the certificates upon the achievement of the Price/Time Goal on or before the close of the Restriction Period. With respect to shares of Restricted Stock which are issued subject to a Price/Time Goal which fail to meet the goal before the end of the Restriction Period, all such shares shall be forfeited, and the Corporation shall have the right to return such shares to the Corporation.
 
4.4
                                
Termination of Employment
 
In the event the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company before the end of any Restriction Period with the consent of the Committee, or upon the Participant's death, or retirement or disability pursuant to applicable disability or retirement plans of the Company before the end of any Restriction Period, the Committee shall have the absolute discretion to waive all or a portion of the Time Goals and Price/Time Goals established under Section 4.3 provided that the Price/Time Goals with respect to any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Equivalent awarded to Covered Participants pursuant to Section 4.6 shall not be subject to waiver or modification after such goals are established. The shares
thereby released, if any, shall thereafter be delivered to such Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or designated beneficiary). In the event and to the extent the Committee does not exercise its discretion to waive the Time Goals and Price/Time Goals or a Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company for any other reason and without such consent before achievement of the Time Goal or Price/Time Goal, each award to such Participant upon which the Restriction Period has not lapsed shall automatically be forfeited.

Award of Restricted Stock Equivalents
 
In lieu of or in addition to the foregoing Restricted Stock Awards, the Committee may award to any Participant restricted stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 being applied to such awards as if those awards were for Restricted Stock and subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe ("Restricted Stock Equivalents"). Each Restricted Stock Equivalent shall represent the right of the Participant to receive an amount determined in the manner established by the Committee at the time of award, which value may, without limitation, be equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock. Payment for Restricted Stock Equivalents may be made only in cash, in a lump sum or in installments, as the Committee may determine.

Other Awards shall also include cash payments (including the cash payment of dividend equivalents) under the Plan which may be based on one or more criteria determined by the Committee which are unrelated to the value of Common Stock and which may be granted in tandem with, or independent of, other awards under the Plan.

Any such cash equivalent payments shall be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date determined by the Committee and be on such terms as shall not represent an increase in benefits. Such cash equivalent payments shall be applied against the limits on the maximum number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.4 and 1.5, based on such Fair Market Value.

Upon any attempt to so transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or subject to execution, attachment or similar process, any Award, or any right thereunder, contrary to the provisions hereof, the Award shall immediately become null and void.

Participant Agreement to Plan Provisions
 
The Participant shall notify the Director, Compensation and Benefits or the Secretary of the Corporation of any issues and disagreements regarding the terms and conditions of the Award within the number of days specified in the notice of the terms of the Award to the Participant. Upon resolution of such issues as determined by the Company or, no such notice having been received, upon the expiration of such number of days, the Participant (and the Participant on behalf of his legal representative and designated beneficiary) shall be deemed to have agreed to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Award and the Plan (including without limitation, the conditions of Section 8.2 below) and any agreements, certificates and records issued in connection herewith.
 
8.2
                                
Conditions on Awards
 
In the event that the employment of a Participant holding any unexercised Option or SAR, any unearned Performance Award, any unearned shares of Restricted Stock, or any unearned Restricted Stock Equivalents shall terminate with the consent of the Committee or by reason of retirement or disability, the rights of such Participant to any such Award shall be subject to the conditions that until any such Option or SAR is exercised, or any such Performance Award, share of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Equivalent is earned, the Participant shall (a) not engage, either directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity as advisor, principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, member of any association or otherwise, in any business or activity which is at the time competitive with any business or activity conducted by the Company and (b) be available, unless the Participant shall have died, at reasonable times for consultations (which shall not require substantial time or effort) at the request of the Company's management with respect to phases of the business with which the Participant was actively connected during the Participant's employment, but such consultations shall not (except in the case of a Participant whose active service was outside of the United States) be required to be performed at any place or places outside of the United States of America or during usual vacation periods or periods of illness or other incapacity.

8.4
                                
Rights of Participants
 
Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company for any period of time or to continue the Participant's present or any other rate of compensation. No employee shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.
 
8.5
                                
Tax Withholding
 
The Company shall have the power to withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any withholding or other tax due from the Corporation with respect to any amount payable and/or shares issuable under the Plan, and the Corporation may defer such payment or issuance unless indemnified to its satisfaction.
(a)
                                 
 
Subject to the consent of the Committee, due to (i) the exercise of a NSO, (ii) lapse of restrictions on a Restricted Stock Award, or (iii) the issuance of any other stock award under the Plan, a Participant may make an irrevocable election (an "Election") to (A) have shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under (i) withheld, or (B) tender back to the Corporation shares of Common Stock received pursuant to (i), (ii), or (iii), or (C) deliver back to the Corporation pursuant to (i), (ii), or (iii) previously-acquired shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, in each case having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy all or part of the minimum federal, state and local statutory withholding requirements applicable to the Participant.
(b)
                                
 
Such Election must be made by a Participant prior to or on the date on which the relevant tax obligation arises (the "Tax Date"). The Committee may disapprove of any Election, may suspend or terminate the right to make Elections, or may provide with respect to any Award under this Plan that the right to make Elections shall not apply to such Awards.
(c)
                                 
 
8.6
                                
Foreign Alternatives
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Plan, in the case of any Award (including any Deferred Amount) to any Participant who is an employee of a foreign Subsidiary or foreign branch of the Company or held by a Participant who is in any other category specified by the Committee, the Committee may specify that such Award shall not be represented by shares of Common Stock or other securities but shall be represented by rights approximately equivalent (as determined by the Committee) to the rights that such Participant would have received if shares of Common Stock or other securities had been issued in the name of such Participant otherwise in accordance with the Plan (such rights being hereinafter called "Stock Equivalents"). The Stock Equivalents representing any such Award may subsequently, at the option of the Committee, be converted into cash or an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock or other securities under such circumstances and in such manner as the Committee may determine. Stock Equivalents shall be applied against the limits on the maximum number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.5.
8.7

The Committee's determinations under the Plan, including without limitation, (a) the determination of the Participants to receive Awards, (b) the form, amount and timing of such Awards, (c) the terms and provisions of such Awards and (d) agreements evidencing the same, need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively among Participants who receive, or who are eligible to receive, Awards under the Plan, whether or not such Participants are similarly situated.
 
8.8
                                
Suspensions, Leaves of Absence, and Transfers
 
The Committee shall be entitled to make such rules, regulations and determinations as it deems appropriate under the Plan in respect of any suspension of employment or leave of absence from the Company granted to a Participant whether such suspension or leave is paid or unpaid and whether due to a disability or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled to determine (a) whether or not any such suspension or leave of absence shall be treated as if the Participant ceased to be an employee of the Company and (b) the impact, if any, of any such suspension or leave of absence on Awards under the Plan. In the event a Participant transfers within the Company, such Participant shall not be deemed to have ceased to be an employee of the Company for purposes of the Plan.
 
8.9
                                
Requirements of Law, Governing Law
 
The granting of Awards and the issuance of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.
(a)
                                 
The Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of such agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.
 
Each Award (including Deferred Amounts) shall be subject to the requirement that if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, or qualification of such Award, or any shares of Common Stock or other property subject thereto, upon any securities exchange or under any foreign, federal, or state securities or other law or regulation, or the consent or approval of any governmental body or the taking of any other action to comply with or otherwise with respect to any such law or regulation, is necessary or desirable as a condition to or in connection with the granting of such Award or the issue, delivery or purchase of shares of Common Stock or other property thereunder, no such Award may be exercised or paid in Common Stock or other property unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval, or other action shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee and the holder of the Award will supply the Corporation with such certificates, representations and information as the Corporation shall request and shall otherwise cooperate with the Corporation in effecting or obtaining such listing, registration, qualification, consent, approval or other action. In the case of Officers and other persons subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the Committee may at any time impose any limitations upon the exercise, delivery, or payment of any Award (including Deferred Amounts) which, in the discretion of the Committee, are necessary or desirable in order to comply with Section 16(b) and the rules and regulations thereunder. If the Corporation, as part of an offering of securities or otherwise, finds it desirable because of foreign, federal, or state legal or regulatory requirements to reduce the period during which Options or SARs may be exercised, the Committee may, in its discretion and without the holders' consent, so reduce such period on not less than 15 days' written notice to the holders thereof.
(b)
                                
It is the intent of the Corporation that the Plan comply in all respects with Section 162(m) of the Code, that any ambiguities or inconsistencies in construction of the Plan be interpreted to give effect to such intention and that if any provision of the Plan is found not to be in compliance with Section 162(m), such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent required to permit the Plan to comply with Section 162(m).
(c)
