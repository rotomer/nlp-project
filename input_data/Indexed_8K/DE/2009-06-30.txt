Item 8.01                Other Events
 
In April 2009, the Company announced it would combine the agricultural equipment segment with the commercial and consumer equipment segment effective at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009.  As a result of the combination, the Company expects to achieve greater alignment and efficiency to meet worldwide customer needs while reducing overall costs.
 
Voluntary employee special termination benefits related to the new organizational structure which have been accepted in greater numbers than anticipated are currently expected to result in pretax expenses of approximately $100 million primarily in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The expenses are expected to be approximately 60 percent cost of sales and 40 percent selling, administrative and general expenses.  First-year savings from the separations of approximately $75 million are expected to be realized.  The estimates above have been revised from those disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 31, 2009 filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Deere & Company successful in voluntary separation initiative
 
MOLINE, Illinois (date)  Deere & Company said today that approximately 800 salaried employees will leave the company as a result of a voluntary separation program announced in April.  This total will enable the company to achieve first-year savings of approximately $75 million after a pretax expense of $100 million primarily in the fourth quarter of 2009.   Previously, the company had estimated a pretax expense for the program of about $50 million. This amount was reflected in the annual earnings guidance issued as part of the second-quarter earnings release on May 20.
 
In April, Deere announced a new global operating model that combines the technology, expertise, experience, channels and investments of two former divisions. Those two business units  which individually focused on agricultural and commercial & consumer equipment  became a single unit named the Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Division, effective May 1, 2009.
 
The voluntary separation program was designed to help Deere immediately leverage the efficiencies of the merged divisions. The company said it expects the new operating model will enhance its competitive position around the world.
