SECTION 2  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
Item 2.06.   Material Impairments.
 
On September 29, 2009, Deere & Company management concluded that a noncash charge of approximately $300 million after-tax for impairment of the value of goodwill will be recorded in the fourth quarter ending October 31, 2009 related to reduction of the value of the John Deere Landscapes reporting unit.  This goodwill charge was not included in the Company's net income outlook of approximately $1.1 billion disclosed in the third quarter Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Deere & Company does not expect to be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of the impairment.
 
The conclusion was made in connection with Deere & Company's annual impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 142 (FASB ASC 350), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in connection with the preparation of the financial statements to be included in Deere & Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2009.  The key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment was a decline in John Deere Landscapes' forecasted financial performance as a result of weak economic conditions.
