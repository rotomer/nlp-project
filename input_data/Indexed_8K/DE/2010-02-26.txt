Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On August 26, 2009, the Board of Directors of Deere & Company ("Company") conditionally adopted amendments to Article III, "The Board of Directors," Section 2, "Election" and Section 3, "Vacancies," of the Bylaws of Deere & Company ("Bylaws"), and conditionally adopted proposed amendments to Article Sixth and Section 2.74 of Article Fourth of Deere's Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate") to become effective February 24, 2010 if stockholders vote to approve the proposed amendments to the Company's Certificate, as described in the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 13, 2010.  On February 24, 2010 at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved the proposed amendments to the Certificate. Therefore, the amendments to the Bylaws also became effective on February 24, 2010.
 
Article Sixth of the Certificate was amended primarily to:
 
     E
liminate the classified structure of the Board of Directors through the election of directors whose terms are expiring for one-year terms, so that beginning with the 2013 annual meeting, the entire Board of Directors will be elected annually;
 
     Provide that directors elected by the Board to fill vacancies will serve only until the next election of directors by the stockholders or until a director's earlier resignation or removal; and
 
   
Provide that directors who are elected to the Board of Directors after the 2010 annual meeting may be removed by stockholders with or without cause.
 
Section 2.74 of Article Fourth of the Certificate was amended to:
 
     Delete the following sentence: "The classes in which such directors serve, as provided by article sixth, may be designated by the holders of the applicable preferred stock, unless such classes have been previously designated by the board of directors."
 
Article III, Section 2 of the Bylaws was amended primarily to:
 
     
Provide for the annual election of directors, eliminating the provision that directors are elected by class for three year terms; and
 
     
Provide that any director elected after the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders may be removed from office with or without cause.
 
Article III, Section 3 of the Bylaws was amended primarily to:
 
     
Provide that vacancies on the board of directors resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the board of directors, and any other vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the then remaining board of directors, although less than a quorum; and
 
     
Provide that any director so chosen shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders, eliminating the provision that the director serve until the next election of the class of directors.
The foregoing description of the amendments to the Bylaws and Certificate is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete text of the Bylaws and the Certificate, as amended, both of which are attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein as Exhibits to this report.

Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
2.22     The term "stock junior to the preferred stock," whenever used with reference to the preferred stock, shall mean the common stock and other stock of the corporation over which the preferred stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation.
 
2.23     The term "subsidiary" shall mean any corporation, association or business trust, the majority of whose outstanding shares (at the time of determination) having voting power for the election of directors or trustees, either at all times or only so long as no senior class of shares has such voting power because of arrearages in dividends or because of the existence of some default, is owned directly or indirectly by the corporation.
 
2.3      
Dividend rights
 
2.31     The holders of the preferred stock of each series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the board of directors, preferential dividends in cash payable at such rate, from such date, and on such quarterly dividend payment dates and, if cumulative, cumulative from such date or dates, as may be fixed by the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series. The holders of the preferred stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends thereon other than those specifically provided for by the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto, or such resolutions of the board of directors, nor shall any arrearages in dividends on the preferred stock bear any interest.
 
2.32     So long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, no dividends (other than dividends payable in stock junior to the preferred stock or in options, rights or warrants to purchase or acquire such stock junior to the preferred and cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with any such dividend) shall be paid or declared in cash or otherwise, nor shall any other distribution be made, on any stock junior to the preferred stock, unless
 
2.321   there shall be no arrearages in dividends on preferred stock for any past quarterly dividend period, and dividends in full for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared on all preferred stock (cumulative and non-cumulative); and
 
2.322   the corporation shall have paid or set aside all amounts, if any, then or theretofore required to be paid or set aside for all sinking funds, if any, for the preferred stock of any series; and
 
2.323   the corporation shall not be default on any of its obligations to redeem any of the preferred stock.
 
2.33     So long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, no shares of any stock junior to the preferred stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the corporation or by any subsidiary except in connection with a reclassification or exchange of any stock junior to the preferred stock through the issuance of other
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
stock junior to the preferred stock (or of options, rights or warrants to purchase or acquire such stock junior to the preferred), or the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of any stock junior to the preferred stock with proceeds of a reasonably contemporaneous sale of other stock junior to the preferred stock (or of options, rights or warrants to purchase or acquire such stock junior to the preferred), nor shall any funds be set aside or made available for any sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of any stock junior to the preferred stock, unless
 
2.331   there shall be no arrearages in dividends on preferred stock for any past quarterly dividend period; and
 
2.332   the corporation shall have paid or set aside all amounts, if any, then or theretofore required to be paid or set aside for all sinking funds, if any, for the preferred stock of any series; and
 
2.333   the corporation shall not be in default on any of its obligations to redeem any of the preferred stock.
 
2.34     Subject to the foregoing provisions and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, property or stock junior to the preferred stock or in options, rights or warrants to purchase or acquire such stock junior to the preferred) as may be determined by the board of directors may be declared and paid on the shares of any stock junior to the preferred stock from time to time, and in the event of the declaration and payment of any such dividends, the holders of such stock junior to the preferred shall be entitled, to the exclusion of holders of the preferred stock, to share ratably therein according to their respective interests.
 
2.35     Dividends in full shall not be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series of preferred stock, unless there shall be no arrearages in dividends on preferred stock for any past quarterly dividend period and dividends in full for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared on all preferred stock to the extent that such dividends are cumulative, and any dividends paid or declared when dividends are not so paid or declared in full shall be shared ratably by the holders of all series of preferred stock in proportion to such respective arrearages and unpaid and undeclared current quarterly cumulative dividends.
 
2.4      
Liquidation rights
 
2.41     In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of preferred stock of each series shall be entitled to receive the full preferential amount fixed by the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto, or by the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series, including any arrearages in dividends thereon to the date fixed for the payment in liquidation, before any distribution shall be made to the holders of any stock junior to the preferred stock.  After such payment in full to the holders of the preferred stock, the remaining assets of the corporation shall then be distributable exclusively among the holders of any stock junior to the preferred stock outstanding, according to their respective interests.
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
2.42     If the assets of the corporation are insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts payable to the holders of the preferred stock of the respective series in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the assets available for distribution to holders of the preferred stock shall be distributed ratably to such holders in proportion to the full preferential amounts payable on the respective shares.
 
2.43     A consolidation or merger of the corporation with or into one or more other corporations or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.
 
2.5      
Redemption
 
2.51     The provisions of this section 2.5 shall apply only to those series of preferred stock to which such provisions are expressly made applicable by resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series.
 
2.52     At the option of the board of directors, the corporation may redeem the whole or any part of the preferred stock, or of any series thereof, at any time or from time to time within the period during which such stock is by its terms redeemable at the option of the board of directors, by paying such redemption price thereof as shall have been fixed by the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of the preferred stock to be redeemed, including an amount in the case of each share so to be redeemed equal to any arrearages in dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the total amount so to be paid being hereinafter called the "redemption price").
 
2.53     Unless expressly provided otherwise in the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of the preferred stock to be redeemed, (i) notice of each such redemption shall be mailed not less than thirty days nor more than ninety days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each holder of record of shares of the preferred stock to be redeemed, at his address as the same may appear on the books of the corporation, and (ii) in case of a redemption of a part only of any series of the preferred stock, the shares of such series to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the board of directors may determine.  The board of directors shall have full power and authority, subject to the limitations and provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto or in the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of the preferred stock to be redeemed, to prescribe the manner in which and the terms and conditions upon which the preferred stock may be redeemed from time to time.
 
2.54     If any such notice of redemption shall have been duly given, then on and after the date fixed in such notice of redemption (unless default shall be made by the corporation in the payment or deposit of the redemption price pursuant to such notice) all arrearages in dividends, if any, on the shares of preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease to accumulate, and on such date all rights of the holders of the preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease and terminate except the right to receive the redemption price upon surrender of their certificates for
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
redemption and such rights, if any, of conversion or exchange as may exist with respect to such preferred stock under the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such preferred stock.
 
2.55     If, before the redemption date specified in any notice of the redemption of any preferred stock, the corporation shall deposit the redemption price with a bank or trust company in Chicago, Illinois or New York, New York having a capital and surplus of at least $5,000,000 according to its last published statement of condition, in trust for payment on the redemption date to the holders of the preferred stock to be redeemed, from and after the date of such deposit all rights of the holders of the preferred stock so called for redemption shall cease and terminate except the right to receive the redemption price upon surrender of their certificates for redemption and such rights, if any, of conversion or exchange as may exist with respect to such preferred stock under the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such preferred stock.  Any funds so deposited which are not required for such redemption because of the exercise of any such right of conversion or exchange subsequent to the date of such deposit shall be returned to the corporation forthwith. The corporation shall be entitled to receive from the depositary, from time to time, the interest, if any allowed on such funds deposited with it, and the holders of the shares so redeemed shall have no claim to any interest. Any funds so deposited and remaining unclaimed at the end of six years from the redemption date shall, if thereafter requested by the board of directors, be repaid to the corporation.
 
2.56     Shares of preferred stock of any series may also be subject to redemption through operation of any sinking fund created therefor, in the manner hereinabove prescribed under section 2.5, at the redemption prices and under the terms and provisions contained in the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series.
 
2.57     The corporation shall not be required to register a transfer of any share of preferred stock (i) within fifteen days preceding a selection for redemption of shares of the series of preferred stock of which such share is a part or (ii) which has been selected for redemption.
 
2.58     During the continuance of any arrearages in dividends for any past quarterly dividend period or a failure in fulfillment of any sinking fund or redemption obligation on any series of preferred stock, the corporation shall not purchase or redeem any shares of preferred stock or of any other stock ranking on a parity with the preferred stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor permit any subsidiary to do so, without the consent given in writing or affirmative vote given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose, by the holders of at least 66-2/3 percent of all the shares of preferred stock then outstanding; provided that (i) to meet the requirements of any purchase, retirement or sinking fund provisions with respect to any series, the corporation may use shares of such series acquired by it prior to such arrearages in dividends or failure of payment and then held by it as treasury stock, valued at redemption price, and (ii) the corporation may complete the purchase or redemption of shares of preferred stock for which a purchase contract was entered into for any
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
purchase, retirement or sinking fund purposes, or the notice of redemption of which was initially mailed, prior to such arrearages in dividends or failure of payment.
 
2.59     If any obligation to retire shares of preferred stock is not paid in full on all series as to which such obligation exists, the number of shares of each such series to be retired pursuant to any such obligation shall be in proportion to the respective amounts which would be payable if all amounts payable for the retirement of all such series were discharged in full.
 
2.6       .  The corporation will not, without the consent given in writing or affirmative vote given in person or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose,
Restrictions on certain action affecting preferred stock
 
2.61     by the holders of at least 66-2/3 percent of all the shares of preferred stock then outstanding, (i) create any other class or classes of stock ranking prior to the preferred stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, or create any stock or other security convertible into or exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock so ranking prior to the preferred stock, or increase the authorized number of shares of any such other class of stock or other security, (ii) amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto so as to affect adversely the powers, preferences or rights of the holders of the preferred stock; or
 
2.62     by the holders of at least 66-2/3 percent of the shares of any series of preferred stock then outstanding, amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or any amendment thereto or of the resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series so as to affect adversely the powers, preferences or rights of the holders of the preferred stock of such series; or
 
2.63     by the holders of at least a majority of all the shares of preferred stock then outstanding, (i) increase the authorized amount of the preferred stock, or (ii) create any other class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with the preferred stock, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, or create any stock or other security convertible into or exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock ranking on a parity with the preferred stock, or increase the authorized number of shares of any such other class of stock or other security.
 
If an amendment described in clause (ii) of subsection 2.61 would in no way affect adversely the powers, preferences or rights of the holders of any stock of the corporation other than the preferred stock, such amendment may be made effective by the adoption and filing of an appropriate amendment to the certificate of incorporation of the corporation without obtaining the consent or vote of the holders of any stock of the corporation other than the preferred stock.
 
If an amendment described in subsection 2.62 would in no way affect adversely the powers, preferences or rights of the holders of any stock of the corporation other than the preferred stock of such series, such amendment may be made effective by the adoption and filing of an appropriate amendment to the certificate of incorporation of the corporation
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
without obtaining the consent or vote of the holders of any stock of the corporation other than the preferred stock of such series.
 
2.7       .
Election of directors by holders of certain preferred stock in event of non-declaration of dividends
 
2.71     The provisions under section 2.7 shall apply only to those series of preferred stock (applicable preferred stock) to which such provisions are expressly made applicable by resolutions of the board of directors providing for the issue of such series.
 
2.72     Whenever declarations of dividends (including non-cumulative dividends) on any share of any series of applicable preferred stock shall be omitted in an aggregate amount equal to six quarterly dividends on such share the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall have the exclusive and special right (in addition to any other voting rights), voting separately as a class and without regard to series, to elect at an annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting of the holders of the applicable preferred stock called as hereinafter provided, two members of the board of directors, until four consecutive quarterly dividends shall have been paid on or declared and set apart for payment on such share, if the share is non-cumulative, or until all arrearages in dividends and dividends in full for the current quarterly period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment on the share, if the share is cumulative, whereupon all voting rights as a class provided for under section 2.7 shall be divested from the applicable preferred stock (subject, however, to being at any time or from time to time similarly revived if declarations of dividends for subsequent quarterly periods shall be omitted).
 
2.73     At any time after the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall have thus become entitled to elect two members of the board of directors, the secretary of the corporation may, and upon written request of holders of record of at least 10 percent of the shares of the applicable preferred stock then outstanding addressed to him at the principal office of the corporation shall, call a special meeting of the holders of the applicable preferred stock for the purpose of electing such directors, to be held at the place of annual meetings of shareholders of the corporation as soon as practicable after the receipt of such request upon the notice provided  by law and the bylaws of the corporation for the holding of special meetings of shareholders; provided, however, that the secretary need not call any such special meeting if the next annual meeting of stockholders is to convene within ninety days after the receipt of such request.  If such special meeting shall not be called by the secretary within thirty days after receipt of such request (not including, however, a request falling within the proviso to the foregoing sentence), then the holders of record of at least 10 percent of the shares of the applicable preferred stock then outstanding may designate in writing one of their number to call such a meeting at the place and upon the notice above provided, and any person so designated for that purpose shall have access to the stock records of the corporation for such purpose.
 
2.74     At any meeting at which the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall be entitled to vote for the election of such two directors as above provided, the holders of
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
33-1/3 percent of the applicable preferred stock then outstanding present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum for the election of such two directors and for no other purpose, and the vote of the holders of a majority of the applicable preferred stock so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to elect two directors.  The election of such directors or one such director shall automatically increase the number of members of the board of directors by the number of directors so elected.  The persons so elected, as directors by the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall hold office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the right of the holders of the applicable preferred stock to vote, as a class in the election of directors shall be divested as provided in subsection 2.72. Upon divestment of the right to elect directors as above provided, any directors so elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall forthwith cease to be directors of the corporation, and the number of directorships shall automatically be reduced accordingly. If a vacancy occurs in a directorship elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock voting as a class, a successor may be appointed by the remaining director so elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock.
 
2.75     At any such meeting or any adjournment thereof, (i) the absence of a quorum of the holders of the applicable preferred stock shall not prevent the election of the directors other than those to be elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock voting as a class, and the absence of a quorum of holders of the shares entitled to vote for directors other than those to be elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock voting as a class, shall not prevent the election of the directors to be elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock voting as a class, and (ii) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of the applicable preferred stock, the holders of a majority of the applicable preferred stock present in person or by proxy shall have power to adjourn from time to time the meeting for the election of the directors which they are entitled to elect voting as a class, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present, and in the absence of a quorum of the holders of the shares entitled to vote for directors other than those elected by the holders of the applicable preferred stock voting as a class, the holders of a majority of such stock present in person or by proxy shall have power to adjourn from time to time the meeting for the election of the directors which they are entitled to elect, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
 
3. 
Other provisions
 
3.1       .  The board of directors shall have authority to authorize the issuance, from time to time without any vote or other action by the stockholders, of any or all shares of stock of the corporation of any class at any time authorized, and any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares, and any options, rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such shares, in each case to such persons and on such terms (including as a dividend or distribution on or with respect to, or in connection with a split or combination of, the outstanding shares of stock of the same or any other class) as the board of directors from time to time in its discretion lawfully may determine; provided, however, that the consideration for the issuance of shares of stock of the corporation having par value (unless issued as such a dividend or distribution or in
Authority for issuance of shares
 
Deere & Company Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 
connection with such a split or combination) shall not be less than such par value.  Shares so issued, shall be full paid stock, and the holders of such stock shall not be liable to any further call or assessments thereon.
 
3.2       .  Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, any and all right, title, interest, and claim in or to any dividends declared, or other distributions made, by the corporation, whether in cash, stock or otherwise, which are unclaimed by the stockholder entitled thereto for a period of six years after the close of business on the payment date, shall be and be deemed to be extinguished and abandoned; and such unclaimed dividends or other distributions in the possession of the corporation, its transfer agents or other agents or depositaries, shall at such time become the absolute property of the corporation, free and clear of any and all claims of any persons whatsoever.
Abandonment of dividends and distributions
 
FIFTH.
  The board of directors shall have authority to adopt, make, alter and repeal the bylaws of the corporation.
 
SIXTH.
  The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors consisting of not less than three nor more than eighteen directors. The exact number shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors in office at the time of adoption of such resolution.
 
At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning at the 2011 annual meeting, directors whose terms expire at that meeting (or such directors' successors) shall be elected for a one-year term. Accordingly, at the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting (or such directors' successors) shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders; at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting (or such directors' successors) shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders; and at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.
 
Subject to prior death, resignation, retirement or removal from office (which may be with or without cause for all directors elected after the 2010 annual meeting), a director shall hold office until his or her term has expired and his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified. Except as required by law, any vacancy on the board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the board of directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director so chosen shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's prior death, resignation, retirement or removal from office. In no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

A stockholder providing notice of any nomination proposed to be made at an annual or special meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 3 shall be true and correct as of the record date for the annual or special meeting, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than five

business days after the record date of the meeting. A stockholder in his original notice shall confirm his intention to update and supplement his or her notice as required in the preceding sentence.

To be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder of the Company who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.

Bylaws of Deere & Company
 
 
stockholders pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as now or hereafter amended.
 
A stockholder providing notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting shall further update and supplement such notice, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to this Section 3 shall be true and correct as of the record date for the meeting, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than five business days after the record date for the meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3, provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the meeting. If the Chairman of the meeting determines that such business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedure, he shall so declare to the meeting, any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. The provisions of this Section 3(b) shall not apply to any stockholder proposal included in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as now or hereafter amended. Matters to be voted on at a special meeting shall be governed by Section 4 of this Article II and shall be limited to the matters set forth in the notice of the meeting given by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof).
 
(c)

In no event shall the public disclosure of an adjournment or postponement of a stockholder meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
Section 4.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.
  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman or the Board of Directors. The business transacted at any special meeting of the stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice for the meeting.
 
Bylaws of Deere & Company
 
 
Section 5.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.
  Written, printed or electronic notice of each meeting of stockholders, stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, either personally, by mail or, in the case of stockholders who have consented to such delivery, by electronic transmission, by or at the direction of the Chairman or the Secretary to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid. Notice given by electronic transmission will be deemed given: (A) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.
 
Any consent to delivery by electronic transmission shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Company. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Company is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices by the Company in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
 
Attendance of a person at a meeting of stockholders, in person or by proxy, constitutes a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

  In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
Section 7.  VOTING LIST.
  The Secretary shall prepare and make, or cause to be prepared and made, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

Bylaws of Deere & Company
 
 
within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held, and the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

Whenever a quorum shall be present at any meeting all matters shall be decided by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present, unless otherwise provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation, or Section 2 of Article III or any other provisions of these bylaws.
 
Meetings of stockholders may be adjourned from time to time for any reason and, if a quorum shall not be present, the holders of the shares entitled to vote present in person or by proxy, may so adjourn the meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless the bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken except that, if the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Company may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

such officer may deem necessary or appropriate to assure that the business of the meeting is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
 
 
Section 1.  NUMBER AND QUALIFICATIONS.
  The business and affairs of the company shall be under the direction of or managed by a Board of Directors who need not be residents of the State of Delaware or stockholders of the company. The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, provided no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.
 
Persons who are or have been officers of the company, other than persons who hold or have held either or both of the office of chairman and chief executive officer and the office of president, shall not be elected directors of the company for terms beginning after the date they retire from active employment with the company.

Any director elected after the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders may be removed from office with or without cause.
 
Except as provided in Section 3 of this Article, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees at any such meeting exceeds the number of directors to be elected at the meeting, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. If a nominee for director is not elected and that nominee is an incumbent director, the director shall promptly tender his or her written resignation to the Board, subject to the Board's acceptance. The Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board or the Corporate Governance Committee.
 
Section 3.  VACANCIES. 
Except as required by law, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining

Section 4.  REGULAR MEETINGS.
  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held on at least a quarterly basis.  One regular meeting shall be held as soon as practicable following the adjournment of the annual meeting of stockholders, at such time and place within or outside the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors.

One day personal, telegraphic or telephonic notice given by the Chairman, Secretary or any other officer, shall be sufficient notice of the calling of a special meeting; provided that such persons may give shorter notice if that is deemed necessary or appropriate under the circumstances provided that the shorter notice is actually received by the director prior to the meeting and provision is made at the meeting for participation by means of telecommunication, as permitted by Section 10 of this Article.
 
Notice of special meetings and of regular meetings of the Board of Directors to be held at a place in Alaska or Hawaii or outside the United States shall be given by letter, telegram, cable or radiogram addressed to each director's regular business office and delivered for transmission not later than during the tenth day immediately preceding the day for such meeting.
 
Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors for which a notice is required may be waived in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time of such meeting, and such waiver shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance of a director at any such meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice thereof, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because such meeting is not lawfully convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting of the Board of Directors for which a notice is required need be specified in the notice, or waiver of notice, of such meeting.
 
Bylaws of Deere & Company
 
 
Section 7.  QUORUM.
  A majority of the number of directors in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

Section 11.  INTERESTED DIRECTORS:  QUORUM.
(a)
         
No contract or transaction between the Company and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Company and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:
 
(1)
         
The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or

Bylaws of Deere & Company
 
 
(3)
         
The contract or transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the shareholders.

Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction.

Section 1.  DESIGNATION AND MEMBERS.
  During the intervals between meetings of the Board of Directors and subject to such limitations as may be imposed by law and these bylaws, an Executive Committee shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company. The membership of such Executive Committee shall include the Chairman and such other directors as are designated by the Board of Directors at the recommendation of the Chairman.
 
This designation of the Executive Committee and the delegation of authority granted to it shall not operate to relieve the Board of Directors, or any director, of any responsibility imposed upon it or him by law. No member of the Executive Committee shall continue to be a member thereof after he ceases to be a director of the Company.
 
Section 2.  LIMITATION OF POWERS.
  Neither the Executive Committee, nor any other Board Committee, shall have the authority of the Board of Directors in reference to amending the certificate of incorporation; adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation with another corporation or corporations; amending, altering or repealing the bylaws; electing or removing the Chairman, Vice Chairman, President, any Executive Vice President or any Senior Vice President; declaring dividends; or amending, altering or repealing any resolution of the Board of Directors which by its terms provides that it shall not be amended, altered or repealed by the Executive Committee.
