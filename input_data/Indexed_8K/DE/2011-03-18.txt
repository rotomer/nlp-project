Item 7.01           Regulation FD Disclosure
 
 
Due to the natural disaster events in Japan, Deere & Company expects delays on the delivery of some excavators sold under both the Deere and Hitachi brand names as well as Hitachi-branded mining equipment.
 
Deere is also assessing the impact of the March 11th earthquake and tsunami on its Japanese supply base.  Although some suppliers are recovering from the disruptions caused by last week's events, present conditions in Japan make it difficult to estimate the full effects on the supply chain.  Because of the uncertain situation in Japan, it is too early to estimate the impact on Deere's overall business.
 
This report includes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

More detailed information about risks and uncertainties is contained in Deere & Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereto duly authorized.
