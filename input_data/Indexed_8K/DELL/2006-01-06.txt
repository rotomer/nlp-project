EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit ------- ---------------------- 99.1 Press Release issued by Dell Inc., dated January 6, 2006

EXHIBIT 99.1 Dell Accelerates Vesting of 'Out of the Money' Stock Options; Action Taken in Advance of FASB 123R Reporting Requirements ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 6, 2006--Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) today announced it is accelerating the vesting of certain unvested stock options previously awarded under its stock-based compensation plans. The purpose of the accelerated vesting is to reduce future stock option compensation expense that Dell would otherwise recognize in its results of operations with the adoption of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. This requirement becomes effective for Dell on Feb. 4, 2006, the beginning of its fiscal year 2007. The company is fully vesting previously granted stock options that have exercise prices higher than $30.75, the closing price of Dell common stock on Jan. 5, 2006, the effective date of the acceleration. Typically stock options at Dell vest ratably over five years from the date of grant. With the action announced today, Dell expects after-tax stock-based compensation expense of approximately $250 million, or $0.10 per share, in fiscal year 2007. It had previously expected stock-based compensation expense of $0.18 per share for fiscal year 2007. About Dell Dell Inc.

Note: Dell's anticipated stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2007 is a forward-looking statement based on Dell's current expectations. Actual expense could differ materially from this projection because of a number of risks and uncertainties, including the impact of subsequent pronouncements or interpretations of SFAS 123R on the accounting treatment of stock options and those risks described in Dell's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
