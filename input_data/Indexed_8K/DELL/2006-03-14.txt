Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Base Salary and Bonus
On March 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the annual base salaries of Dell's executive officers for fiscal 2007. The Compensation Committee also authorized the payment of fiscal 2006 annual bonus awards to the Company's executive officers pursuant to Dell's Executive Annual Incentive Bonus Plan. The following table sets forth the annual base salary levels of Dell's Named Executive Officers (determined by reference to Dell's proxy statement, dated May 31, 2005) for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, and cash bonus payouts to the Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2006:
Annual Equity Awards
The Compensation Committee also approved annual equity awards for certain employees, including executive officers. Awards granted to the Named Executive Officers consisted of fair market value stock options and target grants of performance based stock units ("PBUs"). The options vest ratably over five years (20% per year), have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Dell common stock on the date of grant ($28.95) and terminate ten years from the date of grant. The actual number of PBUs awarded will depend on Dell's revenue during the performance period relative to pre-established targets. Each vested PBU entitles the holder to receive one share of common stock. The PBUs vest over varying periods ranging from one to five years. The following table sets forth, for each of the Named Executive Officers, the number of options and the target number of PBUs awarded.
All options and PBUs are awarded under the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by stockholders at the 2002 annual meeting.
Unvested options and PBUs will expire upon the termination of employment for any reason other than death or permanent disability. If the termination of employment is due to death or permanent disability, unvested options and PBUs will vest immediately upon such termination of

employment. Vested options will expire one year after termination due to death or three years after termination due to permanent disability. If the termination of employment is for any reason other than conduct detrimental to the company, normal retirement, death or permanent disability, any vested options will expire 90 days after such termination. If the termination is due to normal retirement, any vested options will expire three years thereafter. If the termination is due to conduct detrimental to the company, all vested options will expire immediately upon such termination.
The form of Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement and of PBU Award Agreement are filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
2007 Long-Term Cash Award Program
On March 9, 2006, the Compensation Committee also approved a new fiscal 2007 Long-Term Cash Award Program (the "2007 Program") for all executive officers other than Mr. Dell and Mr. Rollins. The 2007 Program is intended to better balance Dell's long-term compensation programs among cash, stock options, PBUs and restricted stock units. Awards, aggregating up to $49.5 million, will be paid out in cash over varying periods ranging from one to four years from the date of grant. Future payouts are contingent upon continued employment during the payout period.
The following table summarizes the awards under the 2007 Program made to the Named Executive Officers:

The target number of units that may be awarded to you (the "Target") is stated above. The number of units awarded to you (the "Units") will be determined at the end of the Company's current fiscal year. Each Unit represents the right to receive one Share. As a material inducement to the Company to grant you this award, you agree to the following terms and conditions. You agree that you are not otherwise entitled to this award, that the Company is providing you this award in consideration for your promises and agreements below, and that the Company would not grant you this award absent those promises and agreements.
 The Target represents the number of Units you have the opportunity to receive based on the Company's performance. The Units will be awarded to you as soon as administratively feasible following the end of the Company's current fiscal year and will range from 0% to 120% of the Target, to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion.
1. Performance Based Units
 When the Units vest, as described below, the Company will issue you one Share for each vested Unit, and thereafter, you will be a stockholder with respect to such Share. The Units will vest, and you will receive Shares, in accordance with the following schedule:
2. Vesting
Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule, the Company, with the approval of the Chief Executive Officer and upon written notice to you, may defer the vesting with respect to all or any portion of the Units to any date that is not more than ten years after the Date of Grant stated above.
In the event ownership or issuance of shares is not feasible due to applicable foreign exchange controls, securities regulations, tax laws, or other provisions of applicable law, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, you shall receive cash proceeds in an amount equal to the value of the Shares otherwise distributable to you net of amounts withheld in satisfaction of the requirements of Paragraph 5 below.
 If your Employment (as defined below) terminates for any reason other than your death or "Permanent Disability" (as defined in the Plan described below), any Units that have not vested as described above will expire at that time.
3. Expiration
If your Employment is terminated by reason of your death or Permanent Disability, all Units will vest immediately and automatically upon such termination of Employment.
As used herein, the term "Employment" means your regular full-time or part-time employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the term "Employer" means the Company (if you are employed by the Company) or the Subsidiary of the Company that employs you.
 You will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares that may be received by you pursuant to this Agreement until those Shares are issued and registered in your name on the books of the Company's transfer agent. You will have no rights to receive dividend equivalent payments with respect to Shares that may be received by you pursuant to this Agreement. Units granted to you will be satisfied wholly through the issuance and delivery of Shares.
4. Rights as a Stockholder
 You must pay any taxes that are required to be withheld by the Company or your Employer. You may pay such amounts in cash or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company or your Employer for the payment of such amounts. You agree the Company or your Employer, at its sole discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have the right to demand that you pay such amounts in cash, deduct such amounts from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you, or withhold from Shares to which you would otherwise be entitled the number of Shares having an aggregate market value at that time equal to the amount you owe. In the event the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that your tax obligations will not be satisfied under the methods described in this paragraph, you authorize the Company or the Company's Stock Plan Administrator, currently UBS Financial Services Inc., to sell a number of Shares that are issued under the Units, which the Company determines as having at least the market value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations plus additional Shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations and pay such tax withholding to the Company. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants and all participants receive an average price.
5. Agreement With Respect to Taxes
