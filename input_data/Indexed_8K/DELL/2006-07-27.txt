Exhibit 99.1
Dell Inc., a Delaware Corporation (the "Company"), is pleased to grant you shares of the Company's common stock, subject to the restrictions described below. The number of shares awarded to you (the "Shares") is stated above. This award is subject to the following terms and conditions.
The Shares are subject to the following restrictions (referred to herein as the "Restrictions"):
Restrictions and Shares
 You may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Shares with respect to which the Restrictions have not lapsed as described below.
Transfer Restrictions
 If you cease to be a director for any reason other than your death or Permanent Disability (as defined in the Plan described below), you will forfeit any Shares with respect to which the Restrictions have not lapsed as described below. Any Shares that are forfeited shall be returned to the Company and cancelled, and all of your rights to those Shares will terminate, without any payment of consideration by the Company.
Forfeiture Restrictions
 The Restrictions will lapse with respect to the Shares in accordance with the following schedule:
Lapse of Restrictions
Notwithstanding the above, if you cease to be a director by reason of your death or Permanent Disability, the Restrictions will lapse immediately and automatically with respect to all Shares upon such termination.
 The Company will issue the Shares in your name in the form of an entry into a share memo account with the Company's stock transfer agent. The account will show that the Shares are subject to the Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions described herein, you shall be entitled to all the rights of beneficial ownership of the Shares while they are held in the share memo account, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the Company's Board of Directors.
Ownership of Shares
Until the Restrictions have lapsed or the Shares are forfeited and cancelled, the Shares shall be held in the share memo account and you shall not be entitled to receive certificates representing the Shares. After the Restrictions have lapsed with respect to Shares, you (or, in the case of your death or Permanent Disability, your legal representatives, legatees, distributees or guardian) shall have the right to have such Shares certificated and transferred in accordance with the transfer agent's procedures generally applicable to all stockholders.
In order to facilitate the transfer back to the Company of any Shares that are forfeited and cancelled as described herein, you must sign and deliver the attached stock power for the Shares to the Company's Stock Option Administration Department. Upon the forfeiture of Shares, such Shares will be transferred back to the Company pursuant to such stock power and cancelled.
 You must pay any taxes that are required to be withheld by the Company. You may pay such amounts in cash or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of such amounts. You agree that if you do not pay, or make arrangements for the payment of, such amounts, the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have the right to deduct such amounts from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you and shall have the right to withhold from Shares for which Restrictions have lapsed the number of Shares having an aggregate market value at that time equal to the amount you owe.
Agreement With Respect to Taxes
 
 In order to minimize the potential for prohibited "insider" trading, the Company may establish periods from time to time during which you may not engage in transactions involving the Company's stock ("Black-Out Periods"). Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, Restrictions will not lapse with respect to any Shares during an applicable Black-Out Period and the applicable period during which Shares shall be subject to the Restrictions shall be extended until the end of such Black-Out Period.
Black-Out Periods
 This award is granted under the Company's 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan and is governed by the terms of the Plan in addition to the terms and conditions stated herein. All terms used herein with their initial letters capitalized shall have the meanings given them in the Plan unless otherwise defined herein.
