Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 18, 2006, Dell entered into indemnification agreements with three new members of its Board of Directors, Ms. Sallie L. Krawcheck, Mr. Alan (A.G.) Lafley and Mr. Thomas W. Luce, III. These indemnification agreements are substantially the same as the standard form of director indemnification agreement previously entered into by the company with each of its other outside directors. The agreements do not increase the extent or scope of indemnification provided to directors under Dell's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, but were entered into to establish processes and procedures for indemnification claims. The form of standard director indemnification agreement is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.11 to Dell's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2003.
Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On September 15, 2006, Dell received a NASDAQ Staff Determination notice stating that the company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because it has not timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended August 4, 2006. A copy of the press release issued on September 21, announcing the company's receipt of this notice, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On September 18, 2006, Mr. Thomas W. Luce, III was appointed to Dell's Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee of the Board. In accordance with the company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Board of Directors increased the size of the Board from eleven to twelve, effective September 18, 2006. Mr. Luce will serve on the Board of Directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders, at which time his continued service will be subject to renomination and stockholder approval. A copy of the press release issued on September 20, 2006, announcing Mr. Luce's appointment to the Board, is attached as Exhibit 99.2.
There are no relationships or related party transactions between Mr. Luce and the company that would be required to be reported under Section 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The annual meeting of the company's stockholders was held on July 21, 2006. At that meeting, the following four proposals were submitted to a vote of Dell's stockholders:
(1) Proposal 1 (Election of Directors)  A proposal for the election of the persons who will serve as Dell's directors until next year's annual meeting.
(2) Proposal 2 (Ratification of Independent Auditor)  A proposal for the ratification of the Audit Committee's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Dell's independent auditor for fiscal 2007.
(3) Stockholder Proposal 1 (Global Human Rights Standard)  A proposal submitted by The New York City Employees' Retirement System, the New York City Teachers' Retirement System, the New York City Police Pension Fund, the New York City Fire Department Pension Fund, and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System (collectively, the "NYC Pension Funds"), which beneficially own shares of Dell common stock, requesting that the company adopt a global human rights standard.
(4) Stockholder Proposal 2 (Declaration of Dividend)  A proposal submitted by a Dell stockholder requesting that the Board of Directors declare a quarterly dividend.
At the close of business on the record date for the meeting (which was May 26, 2006), there were 2,286,405,598 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the meeting. Holders of 2,032,767,392 shares of common stock (representing a like number of votes) were present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. The following table sets forth the results of the voting:
Table of Contents
With respect to Proposal 1 (Election of Directors), each nominee received more than the number of favorable votes necessary for election and was therefore duly and validly elected by the stockholders. Proposal 2 (Ratification of Independent Auditors) received more than the number of favorable votes required for approval and was therefore duly and validly approved by the stockholders. Stockholder Proposal 1 (Global Human Rights Standard) and Stockholder Proposal 2 (Declaration of Dividend) failed to receive a sufficient number of favorable votes and, therefore, were not approved.

DELL RECEIVES NOTICE FROM NASDAQ DUE TO DELAY IN FILING OF FORM 10-Q
Dell announced today that the company plans to request a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel in response to the receipt on Sept. 15 of a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter indicating Dell is not in compliance with the filing requirement for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14).
ROUND ROCK, Texas, September 21, 2006 
     As anticipated, the letter was issued in accordance with NASDAQ rules due to the delayed filing of the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Aug. 4, 2006. Pending a decision by the panel, Dell shares will remain listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market.
     As previously announced, Dell is unable to file its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended Aug. 4, 2006, because of questions raised in connection with an informal investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into certain accounting and financial reporting matters, and the subsequently initiated independent investigation by the audit committee of its board of directors. The SEC requests for information were joined by a similar request from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who has
 
subpoenaed documents related to the company's financial reporting from 2002 to the present. The company said it will file the report as soon as possible.
