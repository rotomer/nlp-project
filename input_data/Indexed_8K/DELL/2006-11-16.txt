EXHIBIT 99.1 Dell to Announce Preliminary Results for Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 by End of November Company Updates Status of Previously Announced SEC Investigation ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--xx--Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) said today it intends to announce its preliminary results for its fiscal third quarter by the end of this month. The move from the originally scheduled date of November 16 reflects the level of complexity the company is facing in the preparation of its preliminary results. This complexity arises out of the ongoing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the company's Audit Committee into certain accounting and financial reporting matters, and the fact the company has not filed its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter. When the company does announce earnings it will be in the form of a press release only. In addition, the company said that future earnings announcements will be moved back by approximately one week versus Dell's prior schedule. The company also announced it has been informed that the SEC has entered a formal order of investigation. The delay in announcing earnings is not related to that development. Dell continues to cooperate with the SEC, and is committed to resolving all issues in connection with the investigation and regaining compliance with all SEC filing requirements as soon as possible.
