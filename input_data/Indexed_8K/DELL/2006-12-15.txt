EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description of Exhibit --- ---------------------- 99.1 Press Release, dated December 15, 2006

Exhibit 99.1 Dell Receives NASDAQ Notice Due to Delay in Filing of Form 10-Q ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 15, 2006--Dell Inc. (NASDAQ:DELL) announced that the company received, as expected, a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter on December 15, 2006, indicating that the company is not in compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c) (14). The Determination letter relates to the company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal third quarter ended November 3, 2006. The company previously announced the receipt of a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter on September 15, 2006, indicating that the Company was not in compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c) (14) due to the delay in the filing of its Form 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter ended August 4, 2006. On November 2, 2006, the Company appeared before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel to present a plan for regaining compliance and to request continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market. The panel has not yet rendered a decision. As previously announced, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Company's Audit Committee are conducting investigations into certain accounting and financial reporting matters, including the possibility of misstatements in prior period financial reports, and the company previously received a related subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The company is delaying the filing of the Form 10-Q for its fiscal third quarter ended November 3, 2006 because of questions raised in connection with those ongoing investigations. The company is committed to resolving the issues raised in connection with the investigations, and regaining compliance with all SEC filing requirements (including the filing of its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal second and third quarters of 2007) and all NASDAQ listing requirements, as soon as possible.
