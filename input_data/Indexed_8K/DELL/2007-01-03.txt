Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
     Dell has modified the corporate organizational structure of certain of its subsidiaries to achieve more integrated global operations and to provide various financial, operational and tax efficiencies. In connection with this internal restructuring, on December 28, 2006, Dell issued 475,435,817 shares of its common stock, par value $.01 per share, valued at $12 billion based on the closing price on The NASDAQ Stock Market on that date, to a wholly-owned subsidiary in return for an equivalent value in equity interests in the subsidiary. As part of the restructuring, the subsidiary used these shares to acquire a controlling interest in another wholly-owned Dell subsidiary. Because all the shares issued as part of this restructuring are held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Dell, the shares will not be considered outstanding on Dell's consolidated financial statements or for voting purposes. Dell continues to be the ultimate beneficial owner of all subsidiaries involved in the internal restructuring.
     These shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and were issued in a transaction not involving a public offering pursuant to the exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The shares may not be resold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act or other applicable law.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
