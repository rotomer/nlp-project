DELL RECEIVES NASDAQ NOTICE DUE TO DELAY IN FILING OF FORM 10-Q
 Dell announced today that the company has received, as expected, a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter indicating that the company is not in compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c) (14). Dell received this Staff Determination on Sept. 14, 2007 due to the delayed filing of the company's Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended Aug. 3, 2007.
ROUND ROCK, Texas, Sept. 17, 2007
     The company previously announced receipt of NASDAQ Staff Determination letters relating to the delayed filing of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended Aug. 4, 2006, Nov. 3, 2006, and May 4, 2007, and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended Feb. 2, 2007.
     As previously announced, on Aug. 17, 2007 the Board of Directors of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC issued its decision to give the company until Nov. 12, 2007 to file its past due
 
periodic reports and regain compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements. The company expects to file all its past due periodic reports on or before that date.
