Exhibit 99.l Dell Files Past Due Reports, Including Restated Results from Fiscal 2003 Through 2007 ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 30, 2007--Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) today filed its past due periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Those reports contain restated financial information for Fiscal 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (including the interim periods within those years), and the first quarter of Fiscal 2007. The company had previously announced on Aug. 16 that it was restating its financial statements for those periods because of certain accounting errors and irregularities in the previously issued financial statements. The filed reports include the annual report for Fiscal 2007, an amended quarterly report for the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 and quarterly reports for the second and third quarters of Fiscal 2007, and the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2008. These reports can be accessed on Dell's Web site www.dell.com/investor or via the SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov. Dell believes that, with the filing of these reports, it will achieve compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements, and expects that NASDAQ will send the company an acknowledgement to that effect in the near future. The company expects to resume its share repurchase program shortly after it reports its results for the third quarter. Annual Meeting and Analyst Meeting Update The company's annual meeting of stockholders will be held on Dec. 4, 2007. The company plans to issue the proxy statement and other materials related to that meeting within the next week. The company will hold a strategy call on Nov. 29, 2007, when it releases fiscal third quarter 2008 earnings, and will hold an analyst meeting on April 2 and 3, 2008, in Round Rock, Texas.
