Settlements.
S 9. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

Final Term Sheets dated June 10, 2009 relating to the Notes
 
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the underwriting agreement, dated June 10, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among Dell Inc, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Banc of America Securities LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. as representatives of the several underwriters listed on Schedule A of the Underwriting Agreement.
(i) The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and to authorize, issue and sell the Notes as contemplated by this Agreement.
(ii) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(iii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of legal remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect, and, as to remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, to equitable defenses or principles and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may therefor be brought).
(iv) The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject, as to enforcement of legal remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect, and, as to remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, to equitable defenses or principles and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may therefor be brought).
(v) The Indenture conforms, and the Notes, when issued and delivered, will conform, in all material respects as to legal matters to the description contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities."
(vi) The Registration Statement became effective and to the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued. The Registration Statement, as of its effective date and as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, appears on its face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(vii) The Prospectus, as of its date, appears on its face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.
(viii) The Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, appears on its face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.
(ix) The statements in each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements constitute a summary as to legal matters, fairly present and summarize, in all material respects, the legal matters referred to therein.
(x) The Company's execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes (i) will not result in any Default under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument that is included as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2009, and (iii) will not result in any violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any United States federal or New York or Texas state statute, law, rule, or regulation, except with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such breaches, defaults or violations that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change; provided, however, we express no opinion in this opinion (x) with respect to federal or state securities laws or blue sky laws, rules or regulations or any state or federal anti-fraud statute, rule or regulation. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental or regulatory agency or body or any court is required for the Company's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes, except (a) such as have been obtained or made on or prior to the date hereof; (b) such as may be required under state securities and blue sky laws; (c) such as may be required after the date hereof pursuant to the Company's periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act; (d) those for which the failure to obtain or make would not, either individually or in the aggregate (1) have a Material Adverse Change, or (2) interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Notes in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Disclosure Package or the Notes.
(xi) The Company is not, and after receipt of payment for the Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof as contemplated under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus will not be, required to register as an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, in-house attorneys for the Company, representatives of the registered public accountants for the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although we did not verify such information and are not passing on and do not assume responsibility for, or express
 
any opinion regarding the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except as expressly set forth in opinions (v) and (ix) above, on the basis of the foregoing, (relying as to materiality to the extent we deem appropriate on officers, employees and other representatives of the Company), no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective or on the date of this Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Disclosure Package as of the Initial Sale Time and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We do not express any view as to the financial statements and other information of an accounting or financial nature included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, nor do we, in each case, express any view as to the Company's management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
 
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement, dated June 10, 2009 among Dell Inc, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Banc of America Securities LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. as representatives of the several underwriters listed on Schedule A of the Underwriting Agreement.
(i) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the law of the State of Texas.
(ii) To my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, there are no legal or governmental actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change.
(iii) The issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein will not result in any violation of any judgment, order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority known to me directed to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their properties in a proceeding to which any of them or their property is a party, except for any such violation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Change.
(iv) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, at the time they were filed with the Commission, appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.
