Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
     On September 20, 2009, Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Dell"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Dell, DII - Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Dell ("Purchaser"), and Perot Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Perot Systems"), pursuant to which Dell will acquire Perot Systems, a worldwide provider of information technology services and business solutions to a broad range of customers.
     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Purchaser will commence a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Perot Systems (the "Shares") at a purchase price of $30.00 per share in cash, without interest thereon (the "Offer Price"). Upon successful completion of the Offer, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into Perot Systems (the "Merger") and Perot Systems will survive the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Dell.
     Purchaser has agreed to commence the Offer by no later than October 2, 2009, and the Offer shall remain open for at least 20 business days. Consummation of the Offer and the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, that (i) there is validly tendered (and not withdrawn) at least 66 /% of the Shares determined on a fully-diluted basis, (ii) certain regulatory clearances have been obtained by the parties, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearances under antitrust laws of other countries, (iii) a material adverse effect to Perot Systems  shall not have occurred and (iv) the other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived.

     At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each outstanding Share, other than Shares owned by Dell or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, will automatically be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that options to purchase Shares and stock appreciation rights settleable in Shares (collectively, "Company Stock Option Awards") granted under any of Perot Systems' equity based compensation plans (the "Stock Plans") shall vest in full immediately after Purchaser acquires 80% of the outstanding common stock of Perot Systems (the "Conversion Time"), and immediately after will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise or base price, as applicable, per share of each such Company Stock Option Award, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option Award. The Merger Agreement further provides that each restricted stock unit award and restricted stock award ("a Restricted Stock Award") that is outstanding under any Stock Plan, whether or not then vested or earned, shall be, immediately after the Conversion Time, cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (x) the Offer Price multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award. Certain executive officers of Perot Systems may elect to convert a percentage of the consideration otherwise payable in the Merger with respect to their Company Stock Option Awards or Restricted Stock Awards into restricted stock unit awards of Dell.
 
     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Perot Systems granted Dell and Purchaser, subject to certain conditions and limitations, an irrevocable option to purchase, following completion of the Offer and at the Offer Price, a number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Dell or Purchaser at the time of exercise of the option, constitutes one share more than 90% of the fully-diluted Shares (the "Top-Up Option"). The Top-Up Option is intended to expedite the timing of the completion of the Merger by effecting the Merger pursuant to Delaware's "short form" merger statute. Following the Offer and, if necessary, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if Purchaser does not own at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, a vote of the stockholders of Perot Systems is required to consummate the Merger. In such case, the approval of the Merger at a meeting of the stockholders of Perot Systems would be assured because of Purchaser's ownership of at least 66 /% of the Shares following completion of the Offer.

     The Merger Agreement further provides that, upon payment for the Shares pursuant to the Offer, Dell shall be entitled to designate a number of directors to the Board of Directors of Perot Systems (the "Board") in proportion with the percentage of the Shares it owns following the Offer. Between such time and the Effective Time, the Board will have at least three directors who are directors of Perot Systems on the date of the Merger Agreement and who are neither officers of Perot Systems nor designees or affiliates of Dell.
     Dell, Purchaser and Perot Systems have made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and agreed to certain customary covenants, including covenants regarding operation of the business of Perot Systems and its subsidiaries prior to the closing and covenants prohibiting Perot Systems from soliciting, or providing information or entering into discussions concerning, or proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions, except in limited circumstances relating to unsolicited proposals that are, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a proposal superior to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In the case of such a proposal, Perot Systems may not terminate the Merger Agreement if Dell makes a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement to be at least as favorable as such proposal.
     Dell has also agreed to guaranty the full performance and payment by Purchaser of each of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by Purchaser under the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.
     The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Additional Agreements
     As inducement to Dell to enter into the Merger Agreement, certain officers, directors and principal stockholders of Perot Systems (as listed below in the description to Exhibit 2.2 and Exhibit 2.3 of Item 9.01) (the "Tendering Stockholders") have agreed to tender their Shares in connection with the Offer and to vote in favor of the Merger pursuant to Tender and Voting Agreements, dated September 20, 2009, entered into with Dell, Purchaser and Perot Systems (the "Tender Agreements"). In addition, such Tendering Stockholders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to refrain from disposing of their Shares and soliciting alternative acquisition proposals to the Merger.
     The foregoing description of the Tender Agreements is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tender Agreements, forms of which are filed as Exhibit 2.2 and Exhibit 2.3 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
     Additionally, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, H. Ross Perot and Ross Perot, Jr. have signed noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements with Dell and Perot Systems that limit their ability to compete with Perot Systems or solicit its employees or customers for a period ending December 31, 2014. If the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the closing of the Offer, such agreements will not become effective and will have no force or effect.
Cautionary Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
     The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Perot Systems, Dell or Purchaser. In particular, the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement.
 
The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement and are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by Perot Systems in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. These confidential disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may be subject to a standard of materiality provided for in the Merger Agreement and have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among Perot Systems, Dell and Purchaser, rather than establishing matters of fact. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may also change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may not be fully disclosed in the parties' public disclosures. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement may not constitute the actual state of facts about Perot Systems, Dell or Purchaser. Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of Perot Systems, Dell or Purchaser, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Exhibit 99.1
DELL TO ACQUIRE PEROT SYSTEMS FOR $3.9 BILLION, CREATING COMPREHENSIVE, CUSTOMER-FOCUSED IT-SOLUTIONS COMPANY
Dell and Perot Systems have entered a definitive agreement for Dell to acquire Perot Systems in a transaction valued at approximately $3.9 billion. Terms of the agreement were approved yesterday by the boards of directors of both companies.
ROUND ROCK and PLANO, Texas, Sept. 21, 2009 
The acquisition will result in a compelling combination of two iconic information-technology brands. The expanded Dell will be even better positioned for immediate and long-term growth and efficiency driven by:
Complementary Capabilities
Dell and Perot Systems share several key characteristics and our products, services and structures are overwhelmingly complementary. They have similarly strong, relationship-based business cultures. People in both organizations are recognized for helping customers thrive by using IT for greater effectiveness and productivity. The combination also provides some compelling opportunities for improved efficiency, which will benefit our customers even further.
Dell's global commercial customer base spans large corporations, government agencies, health-care providers, educational institutions, and small and medium enterprises (SME). The company's large existing services business includes breakthroughs in the concept and delivery of modular services, as well as expertise in infrastructure consulting and software-as-a-service. Dell is a leader in computer systems, including standards-based network servers, and in the fast-growing segment of data-storage hardware.
Perot Systems provides world-class services, including in applications, technology, infrastructure, business processes and consulting. The company is a leading provider to clients in health-care, government and other commercial segments, from SMEs to the largest global institutions. Perot Systems has a large and growing base of customers and service-delivery capabilities in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia.
Over the past four quarters Dell and Perot Systems had a combined $16 billion in enterprise-hardware and IT-services revenue, with about $8 billion from enhanced services and support.
 
Tender Offer, Closing and Initial Integration
Under the terms of the agreement, Dell will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding Class A common stock of Perot Systems for $30 per share in cash. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The transaction, which is subject to customary government approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions, is expected to close in Dell's November-January fiscal quarter.
Once the acquisition is complete, Perot Systems will become Dell's services unit and be led from Plano by Peter Altabef, the current Perot Systems chief executive officer. At the same time, Dell directors are expected to consider Ross Perot Jr., Perot Systems' chairman of the board, for appointment to the Dell board. Based on current estimates, the transaction is expected to be accretive to Dell's GAAP earnings in its fiscal 2012.

Quotes:
"We consider Perot Systems to be a premium asset with great people that enhances our opportunities for immediate and long-term growth. This significantly expands Dell's enterprise-solutions capabilities and makes Perot Systems' strengths available to even more customers around the world. There will be efficiencies from combining the companies, but the acquisition makes such great sense because of the obvious ways our businesses complement each other."
Michael Dell, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dell:
"This transaction represents a great opportunity for our company and our associates. Today's announcement is the next step in formalizing a relationship that has flourished for some time. When my father founded Perot Systems he envisioned a global information-technology leader. The new, larger Dell builds on that promise and its own successes by taking Perot Systems' expertise to more customers than ever."
Ross Perot Jr., Chairman of the Board, Perot Systems:
