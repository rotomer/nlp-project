Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
Dell Inc. (Dell) is furnishing under this Item 7.01 a press release and a copy of an investor presentation for the December 16, 2009 Perot Systems Corporation integration conference call.  The press release and the investor presentation are furnished herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2.
The investor presentation contains information about Dells non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, which are not measurements of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, as defined by Dell, represent net income and earnings per share as adjusted to exclude acquisition expenses related to Dells acquisition of Perot Systems Corporation (Perot Systems), amortization of purchased intangible assets related to Perot Systems as well as prior acquisitions, organizational effectiveness costs, and stock option accelerated vesting charges.  Organizational effectiveness costs include severance and facility actions.  Acquisition expense related to Dells acquisition of Perot Systems consists of acquisition related cash compensation payments, retention bonuses, integration costs, bankers fees, legal fees, and consulting fees.  The investor presentation contains a quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to net income and earnings per share as reported on a GAAP basis.
As a result of Dells acquisition of Perot Systems, Dell incurred significant amounts of acquisition related expenses and will be amortizing a significant amount of purchased intangible assets.   Management does not consider these items to be fundamental to Dells operating performance and as such excludes these items when evaluating Dells operating performance.   In addition, Dell has been, for recent quarters, providing the effects of organizational effectiveness costs, and in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, stock option accelerated vesting charges, to investors to supplement GAAP financial information because Dells management evaluates the operating performance of the company without these items.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, Dell will provide investors with supplemental non-GAAP financial measures and include a reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Dell has included non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share in the furnished presentation to provide information to investors that is consistent with the information Dells management uses to evaluate operating performance.  Dell uses non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to supplement Dells GAAP financial measures and to facilitate an enhanced understanding of historical results and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons.  Dell presents the non-GAAP financial measures to investors to provide greater transparency to the information Dells management uses in its financial and operational decision-making and to allow investors to see Dells operating results through the eyes of management.   Dell further believes that providing this information better enables Dells investors to understand Dells operating performance, and to better compare Dells current financial results with Dells past financial results.  There are, however, limitations to the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  Other companies, including companies in Dells industry, may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than Dell does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.  Further, non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Dells management compensates for the foregoing limitations by relying primarily on Dells GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.  Dell provides detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within the financial information included with press releases and in other written materials that include the non-GAAP financial measures, and Dell encourages investors to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of any non-GAAP financial measures.
The information in this Item 7.01 and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 furnished herewith shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in any such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Dell Services Focusing on Simple, Effective, Best-Value IT Solutions for Customers
Company Says Integration of Former Perot Systems Progressing Well
Dell Expects Q4 Expense for Acquisition-Related Costs
ROUND ROCK, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 16, 2009--Dell leaders today will tell investors and others that the companys integration of Perot Systems into a broader Dell Services organization is progressing well, and will benefit customers by making information-technology solutions easier to access and simpler to manage.
Dell now has a comprehensive and growing set of leading solutions that meet customer needs, so they can manage their IT most efficiently, said Peter Altabef, president of Dell Services. The Dell Services and Perot heritage of strong customer focus positions us extremely well to help customers of all types and sizes use IT to solve problems and derive the best value for their technology investments.
According to Mr. Altabef, Dell Services is focused on combining its knowledge of different industries and requirements, together with Dells technology-platform expertise, to help customers succeed in:
Reducing labor requirements by increasing automation;
Applying appropriate IT-as-a-service models;
Performing IT-related tasksor having them done by Dellremotely wherever possible; and
Increasingly doing all of this based on technology industry standards.
Dell acquired Perot Systems on Nov. 3, in the process extending the reach of Dell Services into consulting, applications, business-process outsourcing and hosting. The combination immediately expanded Dells already significant range of managed and modular services, and makes all existing and future capabilities available to Dells large global customer base.
Mr. Altabef; Brian Gladden, Dells chief financial officer; Steve Schuckenbrock, president, Large Enterprises; and Paul Bell, president, Public, are to update investors and equity analysts on the progress of the integration in an 8 a.m. EST conference call today.
Dell will consolidate financial results from Perot Systems beginning with Dells fiscal fourth quarter, which ends Jan. 29. The company expects Q4 revenue from the former Perot Systems business to be similar to what Perot reported in its third quarter, though there is typically some seasonal softness in the fourth quarter.
Dell expects to recognize an estimated pretax expense of $120-130 million in the fourth quarter, and about $20-25 million per quarter throughout fiscal year 2011, for costs related to the Perot Systems acquisition. Dell anticipates amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition will be about $40-50 million in the fourth quarter as well as in each quarter of fiscal year 2011, in addition to the $40 million in amortization Dell typically reports in a quarter.
Separately, Dell said it will incur combined, pretax organizational-effectiveness expenses of $80-120 million in the fourth quarter resulting from the transfer of its Poland manufacturing facility, together with additional optimization of facilities, products and processes.
Additional information about the integration of Perot Systems and separate organizational effectiveness is available in the conference presentation.
Dell plans to report fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 18.
