The Committee shall have the right, in its discretion, to make Awards in substitution or exchange for any award granted under another compensatory plan of the Company, any Affiliate, or any business entity acquired or to be acquired by the Company or an Affiliate or with which the Company or an Affiliate has combined or will combine.
 
The Committee may reserve the right in an Award Agreement to cause a forfeiture of the gain realized by a Grantee with respect to an Award thereunder on account of actions taken by, or failed to be taken by, such Grantee as and to the extent specified in such Award Agreement, including, but not limited to, Conduct Detrimental to the Company as that term is defined in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee may rescind an outstanding Award if the Grantee thereof is an Employee and is terminated for Conduct Detrimental to the Company as defined in the applicable Award Agreement or for "cause" as defined in any other agreement between the Company or such Affiliate and such Grantee, as applicable.
Any Award granted pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to mandatory repayment by the Grantee to the Company to the extent the Grantee is, or in the future becomes, subject to (a) any Company "clawback" or recoupment policy including, but not limited to, any requirement set forth in this Plan or in an Award Agreement, or (b) any law, rule or regulation which imposes mandatory recoupment, under circumstances set forth in such law, rule or regulation.
 
Except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Stock, other securities or other property), stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, change in control, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of Stock or other securities or similar transaction), the Company may not, without obtaining stockholder approval: (a) amend the terms of outstanding Options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding Options or SARs; (b) cancel outstanding Options or SARs in exchange for or substitution of Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs; or (c) cancel outstanding Options or SARs with an exercise price above the current stock price in exchange for cash or other securities.
 
The Committee may permit or require a Grantee to defer receipt of any Stock or cash payment pursuant to any Award into a deferred compensation arrangement, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or Dividend Equivalent Rights and, in connection therewith, provisions for converting such credits into Restricted Stock Units and for restricting deferrals to comply with hardship distribution rules affecting tax-qualified retirement plans subject to Code Section 401(k)(2)(B)(IV), that no Dividend Equivalent Rights may be granted in connection with, or related to, an Award of Options or SARs. Any such deferrals shall be made in a manner that complies with Code Section 409A.
provided
 
No member of the Board, the Committee, or an employee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award or Award Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the ownership of the shares of Stock issued under the Plan may be evidenced in such a manner as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, including by book-entry or direct registration (including transaction advices) or the issuance of one or more share certificates.
 
Any interpretation or construction of, and any other determination contemplated to be made under, the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement shall be made by the Company consistent with the terms of the Plan and shall be final, binding, and conclusive whether or not expressly provided for in any provision of the Plan, such Award or such Award Agreement. Any disputes relating to a decision or determination by the Company shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of this Plan and any Award Agreement.
 
 
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 4 and subject to adjustment as provided under the Plan, the total number of shares of Stock that shall be authorized for issuance for Awards under the Plan shall be seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of Stock plus the number of shares of Stock related to awards outstanding under the Prior Plan as of the Effective Date which thereafter terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of such shares. Such shares of Stock may be authorized and unissued shares of Stock or treasury shares of Stock or any combination of the foregoing, as may be determined from time to time by the Board or by the Committee. Any of the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan may be used for any type of Award under the Plan, and any or all of the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be available for issuance pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.
 
In connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Code Section 424(a) applies, the Committee shall have the right to cause the Company to assume awards previously granted under a compensatory plan by another business entity that is a party to such transaction and to substitute Awards under the Plan for such awards. The number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 4.1 shall not be increased by the number of shares of Stock subject to any such assumed awards and substitute Awards. Shares available for issuance under a shareholder-approved plan of a business entity that is a party to such transaction (as appropriately adjusted, if necessary, to reflect such transaction) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of shares of Stock otherwise available for issuance under the Plan, subject to applicable rules of any Stock Exchange on which the Stock is listed.
 
(a) Shares of Stock subject to an Award shall be counted as used as of the Grant Date.
(b) Any shares of Stock that are subject to an Award shall be counted against the share issuance limit set forth in Section 4.1 as one (1) share for every one (1) share of Stock subject to such Award. The gross number of shares of Stock issued in connection with an Award of SARs shall be counted toward the share issuance limit set forth in Section 4.1.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.1, any shares of Stock related to Awards under the Plan which thereafter terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of such shares shall be available again for issuance under the Plan.
(d) The number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall not be increased by the number of shares of Stock (i) tendered or withheld or subject to an Award surrendered in
 
connection with the purchase of shares of Stock upon exercise of an Option as provided in Section 12.2, (ii) deducted or delivered from payment of an Award in connection with the Company's tax withholding obligations as provided in Section 18.3 or (iii) purchased by the Company with proceeds from Option exercises.
 
 
The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date. Following the Effective Date, no awards shall be made under the Prior Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares of Stock reserved under the Prior Plan to settle awards, including performance-based awards, which are made under the Prior Plan prior to the Effective Date may be issued and delivered following the Effective Date to settle such awards.
 
The Plan shall terminate automatically ten (10) years after the Effective Date and may be terminated on any earlier date as provided in Section 5.3.
 
The Board may, at any time and from time to time, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as to any shares of Stock as to which Awards have not been made. The effectiveness of any amendment to the Plan shall be contingent on approval of such amendment by the Company's stockholders to the extent provided by the Board or required by Applicable Laws (including the rules of any Stock Exchange on which the Stock is then listed), that no amendment shall be made to the no-repricing provisions of Section 3.4, the Option pricing provisions of Section 8.1 or the Stock Appreciation Rights pricing provisions of Section 9.1 without the approval of the Company's stockholders. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair rights or obligations under any Award theretofore made under the Plan without the consent of the Grantee thereof.
provided
 
 
Subject to this Section 6, Awards may be made under the Plan to any Service Provider, as the Committee shall determine and designate from time to time.
 
During any time when the Company has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act:
(a) the maximum number of shares of Stock subject to Options or SARs that may be granted under the Plan in a calendar year to any person eligible for an Award under Section 6 is ten million (10,000,000) shares;
(b) the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be granted under the Plan, other than pursuant to Options or SARs, in a calendar year to any person eligible for an Award under Section 6 is three million (3,000,000) shares; and
(c) the maximum amount that may be paid as cash-settled Performance-Based Awards shall not exceed 0.5% of the Company's aggregate consolidated operating income in the immediately preceding fiscal year.
 
The preceding limitations in this Section 6.2 are subject to adjustment as provided in Section 17.
 
Subject to Section 3.4, Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in substitution or exchange for, (a) any other Award, (b) any award granted under another plan of the Company, any Affiliate, or any business entity that has been a party to a transaction with the Company or any Affiliate, or (c) any other right of a Grantee to receive payment from the Company or any Affiliate. Such additional, tandem and substitute or exchange Awards may be granted at any time. If an Award is granted in substitution or exchange for another Award, or for an award granted under another plan of the Company, any Affiliate, or any business entity that has been a party to a transaction with the Company or any Affiliate, the Committee shall require the surrender of such other Award or award under such other plan in consideration for the grant of such substitute or exchange Award. In addition, Awards may be granted in lieu of cash compensation, including in lieu of cash payments under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate. Notwithstanding Section 8.1 and Section 9.1, but subject to Section 3.4, the Option Price of an Option or the SAR Price of a SAR that is a Substitute Award may be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the original Grant Date; that such Option Price or SAR Price is determined in accordance with the principles of Code Section 424 for any Incentive Stock Option and consistent with Code Section 409A for any other Option or SAR.
provided
 
Each Award granted pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which shall be in such form or forms as the Committee shall from time to time determine. Award Agreements employed under the Plan from time to time or at the same time need not contain similar provisions, but shall be consistent with the terms of the Plan. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Award of Options shall specify whether such Options are intended to be Non-qualified Stock Options or Incentive Stock Options, and, in the absence of such specification, such Options shall be deemed to constitute Non-qualified Stock Options.
 
 
The Option Price of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee and stated in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option. Except in the case of Substitute Awards, the Option Price of each Option shall be at least the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock on the Grant Date; that in the event that a Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder, the Option Price of an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock on the Grant Date. In no case shall the Option Price of any Option be less than the par value of a share of Stock.
provided
 
Subject to Sections 8.3, each Option granted under the Plan shall become exercisable at such times and under such conditions as shall be determined by the Committee and stated in the Award Agreement, in another agreement with the Grantee or otherwise in writing, that no Option shall be granted to Grantees who are entitled to overtime under applicable state or federal laws, that will vest or be exercisable within a six-month period starting on the Grant Date.
provided
 
Each Option granted under the Plan shall terminate, and all rights to purchase shares of Stock thereunder shall cease, upon the expiration of ten (10) years from the Grant Date of such Option, or under such circumstances and on such date prior thereto as is set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Committee and stated in the Award Agreement relating to such Option; that in the event that the Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder, an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from its Grant Date.
provided
 
Each Award Agreement with respect to the grant of an Option shall set forth the extent to which the Grantee thereof, if at all, shall have the right to exercise such Option following termination of such Grantee's Service. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of Service.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in no event may any Option be exercised, in whole or in part, after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 17 which results in the termination of such Option.
 
Subject to the terms of Section 12 and Section 18.3, an Option that is exercisable may be exercised by the Grantee's delivery to the Company or its designee or agent of notice of exercise on any business day, at the Company's principal office or the office of such designee or agent, on the form specified by the Company and in accordance with any additional procedures specified by the Committee. Such notice shall specify the number of shares of Stock with respect to which such Option is being exercised and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Option Price of the shares of Stock for which such Option is being exercised plus the amount (if any) of federal and/or other taxes which the Company may, in its judgment, be required to withhold with respect to the exercise of such Option.
 
A Grantee or other person holding or exercising an Option shall have none of the rights of a stockholder of the Company (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the shares of Stock subject to such Option, to direct the voting of the shares of Stock subject to such Option, or to receive notice of any meeting of the Company's stockholders) until the shares of Stock subject thereto are fully paid and issued to such Grantee or other person. Except as provided in Section 17, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights with respect to any shares of Stock subject to an Option for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of such shares of Stock.
 
Promptly after the exercise of an Option by a Grantee and the payment in full of the Option Price with respect thereto, such Grantee shall be entitled to receive such evidence of such Grantee's ownership of the shares of Stock subject to such Option as shall be consistent with Section 3.7.
 
Except as provided in Section 8.10, during the lifetime of a Grantee of an Option, only such Grantee (or, in the event of such Grantee's legal incapacity or incompetency, such Grantee's guardian or legal representative) may exercise such Option. Except as provided in Section 8.10, no Option shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement or by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Option which is not an Incentive Stock Option to any Family Member. For the purpose of this Section 8.10, a transfer "not for value" is a transfer which is (a) a gift, (b) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights or (c) unless Applicable Laws do not permit such transfer, a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (and/or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in such entity. Following a transfer under this Section 8.10, any such Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to such transfer, and the shares of Stock acquired pursuant to such Option shall be subject to the same restrictions with respect to transfers of such shares of Stock as would have applied to the Grantee thereof. Subsequent transfers of transferred Options shall be prohibited except to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this Section 8.10 or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The provisions of Section 8.4 relating to termination of Service shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Grantee of the Option, following which such Option shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods specified, in Section 8.4 and Section 8.5.
 
An Option shall constitute an Incentive Stock Option only (a) if the Grantee of such Option is an Employee of the Company or any corporate Subsidiary, (b) to the extent specifically provided in the related Award Agreement and (c) to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time such Option is granted) of the shares of Stock with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options held by such Grantee become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Company and its Affiliates) does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Except to the extent provided in the regulations under Code Section 422, this limitation shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted.
 
If any Grantee shall make any disposition of shares of Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances provided in Code Section 421(b) (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), such Grantee shall notify the Company of such disposition within ten (10) days thereof.
 
 
A SAR shall confer on the Grantee to whom it is granted a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock on the date of exercise over (y) the per share exercise price of such SAR (the "SAR Price") as determined by the Committee. The Award Agreement for a SAR shall specify the SAR Price, which shall be no less than the Fair Market Value of
 
one (1) share of Stock on the Grant Date of such SAR. SARs may be granted in tandem with all or part of an Option granted under the Plan or at any subsequent time during the term of such Option, in combination with all or any part of any other Award or without regard to any Option or other Award; that a SAR that is granted subsequent to the Grant Date of a related Option must have a SAR Price that is no less than the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock on the Grant Date of such SAR.
provided
 
The Committee shall determine, on the Grant Date or thereafter, the time or times at which and the circumstances under which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future Service requirements), the time or times at which SARs shall cease to be or become exercisable following termination of Service or upon other conditions, the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, method by or forms in which shares of Stock shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Grantees, whether or not a SAR shall be granted in tandem or in combination with any other Award, and any and all other terms and conditions of any SAR.
 
Each SAR granted under the Plan shall terminate, and all rights thereunder shall cease, upon the expiration of ten (10) years from the Grant Date of such SAR or under such circumstances and on such date prior thereto as is set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Committee and stated in the Award Agreement relating to such SAR.
 
Except as provided in Section 9.5, during the lifetime of a Grantee of a SAR, only the Grantee (or, in the event of such Grantee's legal incapacity or incompetency, such Grantee's guardian or legal representative) may exercise such SAR. Except as provided in Section 9.5, no SAR shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement or by the Committee, in its sole discretion, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of a SAR to any Family Member. For the purpose of this Section 9.5, a transfer "not for value" is a transfer which is (a) a gift, (b) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights or (c) unless Applicable Laws do not permit such transfer, a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (and/or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in such entity. Following a transfer under this Section 9.5, any such SAR shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to such transfer, and shares of Stock acquired pursuant to a SAR shall be subject to the same restrictions on transfers of such shares of Stock as would have applied to the Grantee or such SAR. Subsequent transfers of transferred SARs shall be prohibited except to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this Section 9.5 or by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
 
Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be made for consideration or for no consideration, other than the par value of the shares of Stock, which shall be deemed paid by past Service or, if so provided in the related Award Agreement or a separate agreement, the promise by the Grantee to perform future Service to the Company or an Affiliate.
 
At the time a grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, (a) establish a period of time (a "Restricted Period") applicable to such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units and (b) prescribe restrictions in addition to or other than the expiration of the Restricted Period, including the achievement of corporate or individual performance goals, which may be applicable to all or any portion of such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units as provided in Section 14. Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or prior to the satisfaction of any other restrictions prescribed by the Committee with respect to such Awards.
 
Pursuant to Section 3.7, to the extent that ownership of Restricted Stock is evidenced by a book-entry registration or direct registration (including transaction advices), such registration shall be notated to evidence the restrictions imposed on such Award of Restricted Stock under the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement. Subject to Section 3.7 and the immediately following sentence, the Company may issue, in the name of each Grantee to whom Restricted Stock has been granted, share certificates representing the total number of shares of Restricted Stock granted to the Grantee, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Grant Date of such Restricted Stock. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock that either (a) the Secretary of the Company shall hold such share certificates for such Grantee's benefit until such time as such shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited to the Company or the restrictions applicable thereto lapse and such Grantee shall deliver a stock power to the Company with respect to each share certificate, or (b) such share certificates shall be delivered to such Grantee, that such share certificates shall bear legends that comply with applicable securities laws and regulations and make appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed on such Award of Restricted Stock under the Plan and such Award Agreement.
provided
 
Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement, holders of Restricted Stock shall have the right to vote such shares of Restricted Stock and the right to receive any dividends declared or paid with respect to such shares of Restricted Stock. The Committee may provide that any dividends paid on Restricted Stock must be reinvested in shares of Stock, which may or may not be subject to the same vesting conditions and restrictions as the vesting conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. Dividends paid on Restricted Stock which vests or is earned based upon the achievement of performance goals shall not vest unless such performance goals for such Restricted Stock are achieved, and if such performance goals are not achieved, the Grantee of such Restricted Stock shall promptly forfeit and repay to the Company such dividend payments. All stock distributions, if any, received by a Grantee with respect to Restricted Stock as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, combination of stock, or other similar transaction shall be subject to the vesting conditions and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.
 
 
Holders of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights as stockholders of the Company (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the shares of Stock subject to such Restricted Stock Units, to direct the voting of the shares of Stock subject to such Restricted Stock Units, or to receive notice of any meeting of the Company's stockholders). The
 
Committee may provide in an Award Agreement evidencing a grant of Restricted Stock Units that the holder of such Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to receive, upon the Company's payment of a cash dividend on its outstanding shares of Stock, a cash payment for each such Restricted Stock Unit which is equal to the per-share dividend paid on such shares of Stock. Such Award Agreement also may provide that such cash payment shall be deemed reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units at a price per unit equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date on which such cash dividend is paid. Such cash payments paid in connection with Restricted Stock Units which vest or are earned based upon the achievement of performance goals shall not vest unless such performance goals for such Restricted Stock Units are achieved, and if such performance goals are not achieved, the Grantee of such Restricted Stock Units shall promptly forfeit and repay to the Company such cash payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a grantor trust is established in connection with an Award of Restricted Stock Units and shares of Stock are held in such grantor trust for purposes of satisfying the Company's obligation to deliver shares of Stock in connection with such Restricted Stock Units, the Award Agreement for such Award of Restricted Stock Units may provide that such cash payment shall be deemed reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units at a price per unit equal to the actual price paid for each share of Stock by the trustee of such grantor trust upon such trustee's reinvestment of the cash dividend received.
 
A holder of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company. Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement.
 
Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement, in another agreement with the Grantee or otherwise in writing after such Award Agreement is entered into, but prior to termination of Grantee's Service, upon the termination of such Grantee's Service, any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units held by such Grantee that have not vested, or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited. Upon forfeiture of such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto, including any right to vote such Restricted Stock or any right to receive dividends with respect to such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
 
The Grantee of an Award of Restricted Stock or vested Restricted Stock Units shall be required, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, to purchase such Restricted Stock or the shares of Stock subject to such vested Restricted Stock Units from the Company at a purchase price equal to the greater of (x) the aggregate par value of the shares of Stock represented by such Restricted Stock or such vested Restricted Stock Units or (y) the purchase price, if any, specified in the Award Agreement relating to such Restricted Stock or such vested Restricted Stock Units. Such purchase price shall be payable in a form provided in Section 12 or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, in consideration for past or future Service rendered or to be rendered to the Company or an Affiliate.
 
Upon the expiration or termination of any Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Committee, the restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units settled in shares of Stock shall lapse, and, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement, a book-entry or direct registration (including transaction advices) or a share
 
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of Stock shall, consistent with Section 3.7, be issued, free of all such restrictions, to the Grantee thereof or such Grantee's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be. Neither the Grantee, nor the Grantee's beneficiary or estate, shall have any further rights with regard to a Restricted Stock Unit once the shares of Stock represented by such Restricted Stock Unit have been delivered in accordance with this Section 10.8.
 
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at the par value of a share of Stock or at such other higher purchase price as shall be determined by the Committee) an Award to any Grantee pursuant to which such Grantee may receive shares of Stock free of any restrictions ("Unrestricted Stock") under the Plan. Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted or sold to any Grantee as provided in the immediately preceding sentence in respect of past Service or, if so provided in the related Award Agreement or a separate agreement, the promise by the Grantee to perform future Service, to the Company or an Affiliate or other valid consideration, or in lieu of, or in addition to, any cash compensation due to such Grantee.
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Awards in the form of Other Equity-Based Awards, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Awards granted pursuant to this Section 11.2 may be granted with vesting, value and/or payment contingent upon the achievement of one or more performance goals. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of Other Equity-Based Awards at the Grant Date or thereafter. Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement, in another agreement with the Grantee, or otherwise in writing after such Award Agreement is issued, upon the termination of a Grantee's Service, any Other Equity-Based Awards held by such Grantee that have not vested, or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited. Upon forfeiture of any Other Equity-Based Award, the Grantee thereof shall have no further rights with respect to such Other Equity-Based Award.
 
 
Payment of the Option Price for the shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the purchase price, if any, for Restricted Stock shall be made in cash or in cash equivalents acceptable to the Company.
 
To the extent that the applicable Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the purchase price, if any, for Restricted Stock may be made all or in part through the tender or attestation to the Company of shares of Stock, which shall be valued, for purposes of determining the extent to which such Option Price or purchase price has been paid thereby, at their Fair Market Value on the date of such tender or attestation.
 
To the extent permitted by Applicable Laws and to the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option
 
may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form acceptable to the Committee) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell shares of Stock and to deliver all or part of the proceeds of such sale to the Company in payment of such Option Price and any withholding taxes described in Section 18.3, or, with the consent of the Company, by issuing the number of shares of Stock equal in value to the difference between such Option Price and the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock subject to the Option being exercised.
 
To the extent the Award Agreement so provides and/or unless otherwise specified in an Award Agreement, payment of the Option Price for shares of Stock purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option or the purchase price, if any, for Restricted Stock may be made in any other form that is consistent with Applicable Laws, including (a) Service by the Grantee thereof to the Company or an Affiliate and (b) by withholding shares of Stock that would otherwise vest or be issuable in an amount equal to the Option Price or purchase price and the required tax withholding amount.
 
 
A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award entitling the recipient thereof to receive credits based on cash distributions that would have been paid on the shares of Stock specified in such Dividend Equivalent Right (or other Award to which such Dividend Equivalent Right relates) if such shares of Stock had been issued to and held by the recipient of such Dividend Equivalent Right as of the record date. A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Grantee, that no Dividend Equivalent Rights may be granted in connection with, or related to, an Award of Options or SARs. The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the Award Agreement therefor. Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently (with or without being subject to forfeiture or a repayment obligation) or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of Stock, which may thereafter accrue additional Dividend Equivalent Rights (with or without being subject to forfeiture or a repayment obligation). Any such reinvestment shall be at the Fair Market Value thereof on the date of such reinvestment. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or shares of Stock or a combination thereof, in a single installment or in multiple installments, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other Award. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award also may contain terms and conditions which are different from the terms and conditions of such other Award, that Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to a Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award which vests or is earned based upon the achievement of performance goals shall not vest unless such performance goals for such underlying Award are achieved.
provided
provided
 
Unless the Committee otherwise provides in an Award Agreement, in another agreement with the Grantee, or otherwise in writing after such Award Agreement is issued, a Grantee's rights in all Dividend Equivalent Rights shall automatically terminate upon such Grantee's termination of Service for any reason.
 
 
Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Performance-Based Awards to a Plan participant in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine.
 
Each grant of a Performance-Based Award shall have an initial value or target number of shares of Stock that is established by the Committee at the time of grant. The Committee shall set performance goals in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are achieved, shall determine the value and/or number of shares of Stock subject to a Performance-Based Award that will be paid out to the Grantee thereof.
 
Subject to the terms of the Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the Grantee of Performance-Based Awards shall be entitled to receive a payout on the value or number of the Performance-Based Awards earned by such Grantee over such Performance Period.
 
Payment of earned Performance-Based Awards shall be as determined by the Committee and as evidenced in the applicable Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance-Based Awards in the form of cash or shares of Stock (or a combination thereof) equal to the value of such earned Performance-Based Awards and shall pay the Awards that have been earned at the close of the applicable Performance Period, or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Committee has determined that the performance goal or goals relating thereto have been achieved; that, unless specifically provided in the Award Agreement for such Awards, such payment shall occur no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which such Performance Period ends. Any shares of Stock paid out under such Performance-Based Awards may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of the Committee with respect to the form of payout of such Performance-Based Awards shall be set forth in the Award Agreement therefor.

The right of a Grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Performance-Based Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions. If and to the extent required under Code Section 162(m), any power or authority relating to an Award intended to qualify under Code Section 162(m) shall be exercised by the Committee and not by the Board.
 
If and to the extent that the Committee determines that a Performance-Based Award to be granted to a Grantee should constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Code Section 162(m), the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Award shall be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Section 14.6.
 
The performance goals for Performance-Based Awards shall consist of one or more business criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the Committee consistent with this Section 14.6. Performance goals shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the requirements of Code Section 162(m), including the requirement that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee result in the achievement of performance goals being "substantially uncertain." The Committee may determine that such Awards shall be granted, exercised and/or settled upon achievement of any single performance goal or of two (2) or more performance goals. Performance goals may differ for Awards granted to any one Grantee or to different Grantees.
 
Performance goals for any Performance-Based Award shall be established not later than the earlier of (a) 90 days after the beginning of any Performance Period applicable to such Award, and (b) the date on which twenty-five percent (25%) of any Performance Period applicable to such Award has expired, or at such other date as may be required or permitted for compensation payable to a Covered Employee to constitute Performance-Based Compensation.
 
Settlement of Performance-Based Awards shall be in cash, shares of Stock, other Awards or other property, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Awards. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which such Performance-Based Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of Service by the Grantee prior to the end of a Performance Period or settlement of such Awards.
 
The performance goals upon which the payment or vesting of a Performance-Based Award to a Covered Employee that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may be conditioned shall be limited to the following Performance Measures, with or without adjustment:
(a) net earnings, net income, or net income per share;
(b) operating earnings;
(c) pretax earnings;
(d) earnings per share;
(e) share price, including growth measures and total stockholder return;
(f) earnings before interest and taxes;
(g) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization;
(h) any one or more of operating income, net income, earnings per share, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization, in each case as adjusted to exclude any one or more of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) net revenue, or sales or revenue growth, whether in general, by type of product or service, or by type of customer;
(j) gross or operating margins;
(k) return measures, including return on assets, capital, investment, equity, sales or revenue;
(l) cash flow, including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
(m) productivity ratios;
(n) expense targets;
(o) market share;
(p) financial ratios as provided in credit agreements of the Company and its subsidiaries;
(q) working capital targets;
(r) completion of acquisitions of assets, businesses or companies;
(s) completion of divestitures and asset sales;
 
(t) customer satisfaction as measured using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric (based on surveys of customers of the Company and its subsidiaries); or
(u) any combination of the foregoing business criteria.
Performance under any of the foregoing Performance Measures may be calculated on an aggregate or a per share basis.
Performance under any of the foregoing Performance Measures (a) may be used to measure the performance of (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates as a whole, (ii) the Company, any Subsidiary, and/or any other Affiliate or any combination thereof, or (iii) any one or more business units of the Company, any Subsidiary, and/or any other Affiliate, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and (b) may be compared to the performance of one or more other companies or one or more published or special indices designated or approved by the Committee for such comparison, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may select performance under the Performance Measure specified in clause (e) above for comparison to performance under one or more stock market indices or peer groups designated or approved by the Committee. The Committee also shall have the authority to provide for accelerated vesting of any Performance-Based Award based on the achievement of performance goals pursuant to the Performance Measures specified in this Section 14.
 
The Committee may provide in any Performance-Based Award that any evaluation of performance may include or exclude any of the following events that occur during a Performance Period: (a) asset write-downs; (b) litigation or claims, judgments or settlements; (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (d) any reorganization or restructuring events or programs; (e) extraordinary, non-core, non-operating or non-recurring items; (f) acquisitions or divestitures; (g) foreign exchange gains and losses; and (h) impact of shares of common stock purchased through share repurchase programs. To the extent such inclusions or exclusions affect Awards to Covered Employees that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, such inclusions or exclusions shall be prescribed in a form that meets the requirements of Code Section 162(m) for deductibility.
 
The Committee shall have the sole discretion to adjust Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, either on a formula or discretionary basis, or on any combination thereof, as the Committee determines consistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m) for deductibility.
 
In the event that Applicable Laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining stockholder approval of such changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining stockholder approval, provided that the exercise of such discretion shall not be inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m). In addition, in the event that the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant Awards that shall not qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may make such grants without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m) and base vesting on Performance Measures other than those set forth in Section 14.6.4.
 
It is the intent of the Company that Performance-Based Awards under Section 14.6 granted to persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered Employees within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and the regulations promulgated thereunder shall, if so designated by the Committee, constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m). Accordingly, the terms of Section 14.6, including the definitions of Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m). If any provision of the Plan or any agreement relating to any such Performance-Based Award does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m), such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
 
If any Grantee is a "disqualified individual," as defined in Code Section 280G(c), then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or of any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by such Grantee with the Company or an Affiliate, except an agreement, contract, or understanding that expressly addresses Code Section 280G or Code Section 4999 (an "Other Agreement"), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the Grantee (including groups or classes of Grantees or beneficiaries of which the Grantee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Grantee (a "Benefit Arrangement"), any right of the Grantee to any exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit under the Plan shall be reduced or eliminated:
(a) to the extent that such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Grantee under the Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements, would cause any exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit to the Grantee under the Plan to be considered a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) as then in effect (a "Parachute Payment"); and
(b) if, as a result of receiving such Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax amounts received by the Grantee from the Company under the Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the Grantee without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment.
The Company shall accomplish such reduction by first reducing or eliminating any cash payments (with the payments to be made furthest in the future being reduced first), then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of Performance-Based Awards, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of Options or SARs, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, then by reducing or eliminating any other remaining Parachute Payments.
 
 
The Company shall not be required to offer, sell or issue any shares of Stock under any Award, whether pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR or otherwise, if the offer, sale or issuance of such shares of Stock would constitute a violation by the Grantee, the Company or an Affiliate, or any other person, of any provision of Applicable Laws, including any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration
 
or qualification of any shares of Stock subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the offering, issuance, sale or purchase of shares of Stock in connection with any Award, no shares of Stock may be offered, issued or sold to the Grantee or any other person under such Award, whether pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR or otherwise, unless such listing, registration or qualification shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of such Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the exercise of any Option or any SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock or the delivery of any shares of Stock underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect with respect to the shares of Stock subject to such Award, the Company shall not be required to offer, sell or issue such shares of Stock unless the Committee shall have received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee or any other person exercising such Option or SAR or accepting delivery of such shares may acquire such shares of Stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company may register, but shall in no event be obligated to register, any shares of Stock or other securities issuable pursuant to the Plan pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or a SAR or the issuance of shares of Stock or other securities issuable pursuant to the Plan or any Award to comply with any Applicable Laws. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option or SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock shall not be exercisable until the shares of Stock subject to such Option or SAR are registered under the securities laws thereof or are exempt from such registration, the exercise of such Option or SAR under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply shall be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption.
 
During any time when the Company has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intention of the Company that Awards pursuant to the Plan and the exercise of Options and SARs granted hereunder that would otherwise be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act shall qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the Committee does not comply with the requirements of such Rule 16b-3, such provision or action shall be deemed inoperative with respect to such Awards to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws and deemed advisable by the Committee, and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that such Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board may exercise its discretion to modify the Plan in any respect necessary or advisable in its judgment to satisfy the requirements of, or to permit the Company to avail itself of the benefits of, the revised exemption or its replacement.
 
 
If the number of outstanding shares of Stock is increased or decreased or the shares of Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or kind of capital stock or other securities of the Company on account of (a) any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, combination of stock, exchange of stock, corporate reorganization, stock dividend or other distribution payable in capital stock, or other increase or decrease in shares of Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the Effective Date, or (b) any merger, consolidation or combination, the number and kinds of shares of stock for which grants of Options and other Awards may be made under the Plan, including the share limits set forth in Section 6.2, shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly by the Committee. In addition, the
 
number and kind of shares of stock for which Awards are outstanding shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly by the Committee so that the proportionate interest of the Grantee therein immediately following such event shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as immediately before such event. Any such adjustment in outstanding Options or SARs shall not change the aggregate Option Price or SAR Price payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of such outstanding Options or SARs, as applicable, but shall include a corresponding proportionate adjustment in the per share Option Price or SAR Price, as the case may be. The conversion or exercise of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in shares effected without receipt of consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any distribution to the Company's stockholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (including an extraordinary dividend, but excluding a non-extraordinary dividend, declared and paid by the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Board or the Committee constituted pursuant to Section 3.1.2 shall, in such manner as the Board or such Committee deems appropriate, adjust (i) the number and kind of shares of stock subject to outstanding Awards and/or (ii) the aggregate and per share Option Price of outstanding Options and the aggregate and per share SAR Price of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights as required to reflect such distribution. In the event of any merger, consolidation or combination referred to in this Section 17.1, (A) subject to any contrary language in an Award Agreement or in another agreement with the Grantee, or otherwise set forth in writing, any restrictions applicable to the Award subject thereto shall apply as well to any replacement shares received by the Grantee as a result of such merger, consolidation or combination, and (B) Performance-Based Awards shall be adjusted (including any adjustment to the Performance Measures applicable to such Awards deemed appropriate by the Committee) so as to apply to the securities that a holder of the number of shares of Stock subject to such Performance-Based Awards would have been entitled to receive immediately following such merger, consolidation or combination.
 
(a)       Adjustments under this Section 17 related to shares of Stock or other securities of the Company shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares or other securities shall be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the nearest whole share.
(b)      The Committee may provide in the applicable Award Agreement at the time of grant, in another agreement with the Grantee, or otherwise in writing at any time thereafter with the consent of the Grantee, for different provisions to apply to an Award in place of those provided in Section 17.1.
 
The making of Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets (including all or any part of the business or assets of any Subsidiary or other Affiliate) or engage in any other transaction or activity.
 
 
No provision in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or Service of the Company or an Affiliate, or to
 
interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company or an Affiliate either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any natural person or entity at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any natural person or entity and the Company or an Affiliate. In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, in another agreement with the Grantee, or otherwise in writing, no Award granted under the Plan shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the Grantee thereof, so long as such Grantee continues to provide Service. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to the Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts provided herein, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan and Awards shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third-party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Grantee or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan.
 
Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations upon the right and authority of the Board to adopt such other incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a particular individual or particular individuals) as the Board in its discretion determines desirable.
 
The Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Grantee any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award or upon the issuance of any shares of Stock upon the exercise of an Option or pursuant to any other Award. At the time of such vesting, lapse, or exercise, the Grantee shall pay in cash to the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or such Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation; that if there is a same-day sale of shares of Stock subject to an Award, the Grantee shall pay such withholding obligation on the day on which such same-day sale is completed. Subject to the prior approval of the Company or an Affiliate, which may be withheld by the Company or such Affiliate, as the case may be, in its sole discretion, the Grantee may elect to satisfy such withholding obligation, in whole or in part, (a) by causing the Company or such Affiliate to withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Grantee or (b) by delivering to the Company or such Affiliate shares of Stock already owned by the Grantee. The shares of Stock so withheld or delivered shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such withholding obligation. The Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock used to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be determined by the Company or such Affiliate as of the date on which the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. A Grantee who has made an election pursuant to this Section 18.3 may satisfy such Grantee's withholding obligation only with shares of Stock that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements. The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be withheld from any Award to satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding requirements upon the exercise, vesting, or lapse of restrictions applicable to any Award or payment of shares of Stock pursuant to such Award, as applicable, may not exceed such number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory amount required by the Company or the applicable Affiliate to be withheld and paid to any such federal, state or local taxing authority with respect to such exercise, vesting, lapse of restrictions, or payment of shares of Stock. Notwithstanding Section 2.20 or this Section 18.3, for purposes of determining taxable income and the amount of the related tax withholding obligation pursuant to this Section 18.3, for any shares of Stock subject to an Award that are sold by or on behalf of a Grantee on the same date on which such shares may first be sold pursuant to the terms of the related Award Agreement, the Fair Market Value of such shares shall be the sale price of such shares on such date
provided
 
(or if sales of such shares are effectuated at more than one sale price, the weighted average sale price of such shares on such date), so long as such Grantee has provided the Company, or its designee or agent, with advance written notice of such sale.
 
The use of captions in the Plan or any Award Agreement is for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of the Plan or such Award Agreement.
 
Each Award granted under the Plan may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.
 
With respect to words used in the Plan, the singular form shall include the plural form and the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, as the context requires.
 
If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.
 
The validity and construction of the Plan and the instruments evidencing the Awards hereunder shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan and the instruments evidencing the Awards granted hereunder to the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
To the extent the Committee determines that the material terms set by the Committee imposed by the Plan preclude the achievement of the material purposes of the Plan in jurisdictions outside the United States, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to modify those terms and provide for such additional terms and conditions as the Committee determines to be necessary, appropriate, or desirable to accommodate differences in local law, policy or custom or to facilitate administration of the Plan. The Committee may adopt or approve sub-plans, appendices or supplements to, or amendments, restatements or alternative version of the Plan as in effect for any other purposes. The special terms and any appendices, supplements, amendments, restatements or alternative versions, however, shall not include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of the Plan as in effect, unless the Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the stockholders.
 
Any controversy arising out of or relating to any Award shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures in the applicable Award Agreement. Such dispute resolution procedures may include binding mandatory arbitration.
 
The Company intends to comply with Code Section 409A, or an exemption to Code Section 409A, with regard to Awards hereunder that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Company determines that a Grantee would be subject to the additional twenty percent (20%) tax imposed on certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans pursuant to Code Section 409A as a result of any provision of any Award granted under the Plan, such provision shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to avoid application of such additional tax. The nature of any such amendment shall be determined by the Committee.
To record adoption of the Plan by the Board as of May 15, 2012, and approval of the Plan by the stockholders on July 13, 2012, the Company has caused its authorized officer to execute the Plan.
 
 

Exhibit 10.2
Stock Unit  US Electronic Agreement
2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is pleased to grant you units representing the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock (the "Shares"), subject to the terms and conditions described below. The number of units that are awarded to you (the "Units") is stated in step one of the Stock Plan Administrator's online grant acceptance process ("Grant Summary"). Each Unit represents the right to receive one Share. As a material inducement to the Company to grant you this award, you agree to the following terms and conditions. You agree that you are not otherwise entitled to this award, that the Company is providing you this award in consideration for your promises and agreements below, and that the Company would not grant you this award absent those promises and agreements. This Stock Unit Agreement, the Grant Summary, and the Dell Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") set forth the terms of your Units identified in your Grant Summary.
 The Company will issue you one Share for each vested Unit to be delivered on the applicable vesting date or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter; provided that in no event shall Shares be delivered later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the calendar year with respect to which the Units were earned and not subject to forfeiture. The Units will vest, and you will receive Shares, in accordance with the schedule in your Grant Summary.
1.    Vesting
 If your Employment (as defined below) terminates for any reason other than your death or "Permanent Disability" (as defined in the Plan described below), any Units that have not vested as described above will expire at that time.
2.    Expiration
If your Employment is terminated by reason of your death or Permanent Disability, all Units will vest immediately and automatically upon such termination of Employment and the Shares will be distributed to you as soon as administratively practical and in all events within 60 days of such termination of Employment.
As used herein, the term "Employment" means your regular full-time or part-time employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the term "Employer" means the Company (if you are employed by the Company) or the Subsidiary of the Company that employs you. As used herein, the term "the Company" includes all subsidiaries, including your Employer.
 You will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares that may be received by you pursuant to this Agreement until those Shares are issued and registered in your name on the books of the Company's transfer agent. Units granted to you will be satisfied wholly through the issuance and delivery of Shares. If the Company declares a cash dividend on its common stock, you will be entitled to receive with respect to each Unit which is outstanding on the dividend record date and which vests an amount in cash equal to the amount of such cash dividend declared and paid on one share of common stock (a "Dividend Equivalent"), so long as such dividend record date occurs not later than the date on which the Share underlying such vested Unit is issued to you. Dividend Equivalents will not be credited with interest. The Company will pay you the Dividend Equivalent payment amount with respect to a vested Unit on the date on which the Company issues the Share underlying such Unit in accordance with this Agreement or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. If the issuance of any Share is deferred to a date later than the vesting date of the related Unit under any agreement between you and the Company, payment to you of the related Dividend Equivalent payment amount similarly will be deferred to such later issue date. You will not be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalent payments with respect to any Units that are not vested Units.
3.    Rights as a Stockholder
 You must pay any taxes that are required to be withheld by the Company or your Employer. You may pay such amounts in cash or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company or your Employer for the payment of such amounts. You agree the Company or your Employer, at its sole discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have the right to demand that you pay such amounts in cash, deduct such amounts from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you (including Dividend Equivalents), or withhold from Shares to which you would otherwise be entitled the number of Shares having an aggregate market value at that time equal to the amount you owe. In the event the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that your tax obligations will not be satisfied under the methods described in this paragraph, you authorize the Company or the Company's Stock Plan Administrator to sell a number of Shares that are issued under the Units, which the Company determines as having at least the market value sufficient to meet the tax withholding obligations plus additional Shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations and pay such tax withholding to the Company. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other participants and all participants will receive an average price.
4.    Agreement With Respect to Taxes
 
You agree that, subject to compliance with applicable law, the Company or your Employer may recover from you taxes which may be payable by the Company or your Employer in any jurisdiction in relation to this award. You agree that the Company or your Employer shall be entitled to use whatever method they may deem appropriate to recover such taxes including the withholding of Dividend Equivalents or the sale of any Shares, paying you a net amount of shares (or cash), recovering the taxes via payroll and direct invoicing. You further agree that the Company or your Employer may, as it reasonably considers necessary, amend or vary this agreement to facilitate such recovery of taxes.
 Subject to the Units remaining exempt from Internal Revenue Code Section 409A or being compliant with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, if you take a leave of absence from active Employment that has been approved by the Company or your Employer or is one to which you are legally entitled regardless of such approval, the following provisions will apply:
5.    Leaves of Absence
 Notwithstanding the vesting schedule set forth above, no Units will vest during a leave of absence other than an approved employee medical, FMLA or military leave. Notwithstanding the preceding, vesting shall not be deferred for any approved leave of absence of less than 30 days. The vesting that would have otherwise occurred during a leave of absence other than an approved employee medical, FMLA or military leave will be deferred by the number of days you are on a leave of absence. For example, if your Units are scheduled to vest on August 1, 2007 through August 1, 2011, and you are on a 40 day leave of absence, the dates on which the vesting occurs will be deferred to September 10, 2007 through September 10, 2011.
A.    Vesting During Leave
 If your Employment is terminated during the leave of absence, the Units will expire or vest in accordance with the terms stated in Paragraph 2 (Expiration) above.
B.    Effect of Termination During Leave
 By accepting this award, you agree that if the Company, acting through the Committee, determines that you engaged in "Conduct Detrimental to the Company" (as defined below) during your Employment or during the one-year period following the termination of your Employment, you shall be required, upon demand, to return to the Company, in the form of a cash payment, certain share value ("Returnable Share Value"). For purposes of this provision, "Returnable Share Value" means a cash amount equal to (i) the gross value of the Shares that were issued to you pursuant to this Agreement, determined as of the date such Shares were issued to you and using the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of Dell stock on that date, plus (ii) any associated Dividend Equivalents. You understand and agree that the repayment of the Returnable Share Value is in addition to and separate from any other relief available to the Company due to your Conduct Detrimental to the Company.
6.    Return of Share Value
For purposes of this Agreement, you will be considered to have engaged in "Conduct Detrimental to the Company" if:
(1) you engage in serious misconduct (whether or not such serious misconduct is discovered by the Company prior to the termination of your Employment);
(2) you breach your obligations to the Company with respect to confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets or breach any agreement between you and Dell relating to confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets;
(3) you compete with the Company (as described below); or
(4) you solicit the Company's employees (as described below).
For purposes of this provision, you shall be deemed to "compete" with the Company if you, directly or indirectly:
You understand and agree that this provision does not prohibit you from competing with the Company but only requires repayment of Returnable Share Value in the event of such competition.
For purposes of this provision, a "Company's employee" means any person employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and "solicit the Company's employees" means that you communicate in any way with any other person regarding (a) a Company Employee leaving the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (b) a Company Employee seeking employment with any other employer. This provision does not apply to those communications that are within the scope of your Employment that are taken on behalf of your Employer.
 
The term "Direct Competitor" means any entity, or other business concern that offers or plans to offer products or services that are materially competitive with any of the products or services being manufactured, offered, marketed, or are actively developed by Dell as of the date your employment with Dell ends. By way of illustration, and not by limitation, at the time of execution of this Agreement, the following companies are currently Direct Competitors: Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, IBM, Gateway, Apple, Acer, CDW, EDS, EMC, Software House International, Insight (Software Spectrum), Softchoice, Computer Sciences Corporation and Digital River. You understand and agree that the foregoing list of Direct Competitors represents a current list of Dell Direct Competitors as of the date of execution of this Agreement and that other entities may become Direct Competitors in the future.
The Committee shall have complete and absolute authority to construe and interpret the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to any determination as to whether you have engaged in "Conduct Detrimental to the Company." Any such interpretations or determinations by the Committee will be final, binding, and conclusive.
The Units are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

Exhibit 10.3
Director Annual
Deferred Stock Unit Agreement
2012 Plan
 
Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is pleased to grant you units (the "Units") representing shares of the Company's common stock (the "Shares"), subject to the vesting and other restrictions described below. The number of Units awarded to you is stated above. Each Unit represents one Share. This award is subject to the following terms and conditions.
 
 You have elected to defer all or a portion of your Director compensation pursuant to a timely filed 2012 Retainer Fee Election Form. As such, your Shares shall not be issued until (i) the Units fully vest, and (ii) you experience a separation from service from the Board, as described below. You may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Units until such time as the Shares are issued.
Deferral Election and Transfer Restrictions
The Units are subject to the following vesting schedule:
Vesting 
 
If you cease to be a director by reason of your death, Permanent Disability (as defined in the Plan described below), or retirement from the Board of Directors after attaining age 65 with a minimum of four years of service, all of the Units will vest immediately and automatically. If you cease to be a director for any other reason, any Units which have not vested on or before your termination date will expire at that time.
 If you separate from service from the Board on or after the vesting date described above, one Share shall be issued to you for each of your vested Units either in (i) one lump sum payment; or (ii) five equal annual installments, in accordance with the Distribution Election made on your 2012 Retainer Fee Election Form. For purposes of this award, a "separation from service" shall be as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), and the regulations thereunder. Shares of common stock that are issued shall be made available from authorized but unissued shares.
Separation from Service
 You will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares that may be received by you
Rights as a Stockholder
until the Shares are issued as described above and those Shares are registered in your name on the books of the Company's transfer agent. If the Company declares a cash dividend on the Company's common stock and, on the record date for such dividend, you hold a Unit pursuant to this Agreement that has not been settled, you will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the amount of such cash dividend declared and paid on one share of Common Stock (a "Dividend Equivalent"), so long as such dividend record date occurs not later than the date on which the Share underlying such Unit is issued to you. Dividend Equivalents will not be credited with interest. Dividend Equivalents with respect to a Unit will become vested on the date the Unit becomes vested and shall be distributed to you at the same time the Share which is attributable to that Unit under the Agreement is issued to you. In the event that a Unit is forfeited under this Agreement, the associated Dividend Equivalent Payment(s) will be forfeited.
 You must pay any taxes that are required to be withheld by the Company. You may pay such amounts in cash or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment of such amounts. You agree that if you do not pay, or make arrangements for the payment of, such amounts, the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have the right to deduct such amounts from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you (including Dividend Equivalents) and shall have the right to withhold from vested Units the number of Shares having an aggregate market value at that time equal to the amount you owe.
Agreement With Respect to Taxes
 In order to minimize the potential for prohibited "insider" trading, the Company may establish periods from time to time during which you may not engage in transactions involving the Company's stock ("Black-Out Periods"). Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if the Units are subject to distribution during a Black-Out Period, such distribution shall instead be made on the earlier of (i) the date you are not subject to any such policy and (ii) the later
Black-Out Periods
 
 
of (A) the end of the calendar year in which such distribution would otherwise have been made, and (B) a date that is immediately prior to the expiration of two and on-half months following the date such distribution would otherwise have been made hereunder.

As a material inducement to the Company to grant you this award, you agree to the following terms and conditions. You agree that you are not otherwise entitled to this award, that the Company is providing you this award in consideration for your promises and agreements below, and that the Company would not grant you this award absent those promises and agreements.

2.    Vesting and Exercisability
 The Options will vest in accordance with the schedule in your Grant Summary (subject to the further provisions stated below).
A.    General Vesting
 You may exercise Options at any time after they vest and before they expire as described below.
B.    Exercisability
 You may exercise Options by giving notice to the Company or its designated agent in accordance with instructions generally applicable to all option holders. At the time of exercise, you must pay the Exercise Price for all Options being exercised and any taxes that are required to be withheld by the Company or your Employer (as defined below). You may pay such amounts in cash or arrange for such amounts to be paid through a brokerage firm or in another manner satisfactory to the Company. You agree that, subject to compliance with applicable law, the Company or your Employer may recover from you taxes which may be payable by the Company or your Employer in any jurisdiction in relation to this award. You agree that the Company or your Employer shall be entitled to use whatever method they may deem appropriate to recover such taxes including the sale of any shares, paying you a net amount of shares (or cash), recovering the taxes via payroll and direct invoicing. You further agree that the Company or your Employer may, as it reasonably considers necessary, amend or vary this agreement to facilitate such recovery of taxes.
3.    Method of Exercise
 All Options will expire on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant or any of the special expiration dates described below. Once an Option expires, you will no longer have the right to exercise it. As used below, the term "Employment" means your regular full-time or part-time employment with the Company or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries, and the term "Employer" means the Company (if you are employed by the Company) or the consolidated Subsidiary of the Company that employs you. As used herein, the term "the Company" includes all subsidiaries, including your Employer.
4.    Expiration
 If your Employment is terminated by your Employer for Conduct Detrimental to the Company, all Options (whether or not vested) will expire at that time and you will be required to return option proceeds as described herein.
A.    Termination of Employment for Conduct Detrimental to the Company
 If your Employment is terminated by you or by your Employer for reasons other than Conduct Detrimental to the Company, Options that are not vested at the time your Employment is terminated will expire at that time and Options that are vested at the time your Employment is terminated will expire at the close of business on the 90
B.    Termination of Employment for Other than Conduct Detrimental to the Company
th
day following the date your Employment is terminated.
 If your Employment is terminated by reason of your death, Options that are not vested at the time your Employment is terminated will become fully vested at that time. All Options will then expire on the first anniversary of the date your Employment is terminated and, until that time will be exercisable by your legal representatives, legatees or distributees.
C.    Death
 If your Employment is terminated by reason of your Permanent Disability, Options that are not vested at the time your Employment is terminated will become fully vested at that time. All Options will then expire on the third anniversary of the date your Employment is terminated and, until that time will be exercisable by you or your guardian or legal representative.

5.    Leaves of Absence
 Your right to exercise Options that are vested at the time the leave of absence begins will be unaffected by the leave of absence.
A.    Exercisability of Options During Leave
Options will not vest during a leave of absence other than an approved employee medical, FMLA or military leave. Notwithstanding the preceding, vesting shall not be deferred (i) for any approved leave of absence of less than 30 days, or (ii) if such deferral would cause these options to be subject to 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The vesting date for all Options that would have otherwise vested during a leave of absence other than an approved employee medical, FMLA or military leave will be deferred by the number of days you are on a leave of absence. For example, if your vesting dates are August 1, 2007 through August 1, 2011, and you are on a 40-day leave of absence, the vesting date for your options will be deferred to September 10, 2007 through September 10, 2011.
B.    Vesting of Options During Leave
 If your Employment is terminated during the leave of absence the Options will expire in accordance with the terms stated under "Expiration" above.
C.    Effect of Termination During Leave
 By accepting this award, you agree that if the Company determines that you engaged in Conduct Detrimental to the Company during your Employment or during the one-year period following the termination of your Employment you shall be required to repay to the Company, in cash and upon demand, the Option Proceeds (as defined below) resulting from any exercise of Options occurring after the termination of your Employment or during the twelve-month period preceding the termination of your Employment. The term "Option Proceeds" means, with respect to any exercise of Options, an amount equal to the number of Options exercised multiplied by the difference between the market value per share of the Company's common stock at the time of such exercise and the Exercise Price. You understand and agree that the return of Option Proceeds is in addition to and separate from any other relief available to the Company due to your Conduct Detrimental to the Company.
6.    Return of Option Proceeds

(4) you solicit the Company's employees (as described below).
For purposes of this provision, you shall be deemed to "compete" with the Company if you, directly or indirectly:
You understand and agree that this provision does not prohibit you from competing with the Company but only requires return of certain Option Proceeds in the event of such competition.

This provision does not apply to those communications that are within the scope of your Employment that are taken on behalf of your Employer.

You understand and agree that the foregoing list of Direct Competitors represents a current list of Dell Direct Competitors as of the date of execution of this Agreement and that other entities may become Direct Competitors in the future.
 
The Committee shall have complete and absolute authority to construe and interpret the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to any determination as to whether you have engaged in "Conduct Detrimental to the Company." Any such interpretations or determinations by the Committee will be final, binding, and conclusive.
 The Company may establish periods from time to time during which your ability to engage in transactions involving the Company's stock is subject to specific restrictions ("Restricted Periods"). Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, you may not exercise Options during an applicable Restricted Period unless such exercise is specifically permitted by the Company (in its sole discretion). You may be subject to a Restricted Period for any reason that the Company determines appropriate, including, Restricted Periods generally applicable to employees or groups of employees or Restricted Periods applicable to you during an investigation of allegations of misconduct or Conduct Detrimental to the Company by you.
7.    Trading Restrictions
 The Options are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
