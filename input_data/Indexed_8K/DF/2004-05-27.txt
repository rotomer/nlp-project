Item 5. Other Events.
     On May 26, 2004, Dean Foods Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), executed an amendment (the "Amendment") to its Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") originally adopted in 1998 to, among other things, (1) increase the exercise price of a Right to $145 per share, (2) reflect the appointment of The Bank of New York as successor Rights Agent, (3) require that any redemption of the outstanding Rights occur prior to the earlier of the Stock Acquisition Date, as opposed to the Distribution Date, and the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement), and (4) eliminate the so-called "deadhand" provisions that stipulated certain actions could be taken only by those members of the Board of Directors that were "continuing directors." A "continuing director" generally was defined as a member of the Board of Directors prior to the commencement of a hostile takeover of the Company. As a result of the Amendment, decisions to be made pursuant to the original Rights Agreement by such continuing directors will now instead be made by a majority of all the directors in office at the time of such decision.
     Concurrently with the filing of this report, the Company is filing a Registration Statement on Form 8-A/A which contains a copy of the Amendment as an exhibit and is incorporated by reference into this report.
