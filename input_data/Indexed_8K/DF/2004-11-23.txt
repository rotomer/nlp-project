Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On November 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized and approved two new executive compensation plans to become effective January 1, 2005.
     The first plan, the Dean Foods Company Post-2004 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the ""), was authorized in response to the passage of The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which added a new section to the Internal Revenue Code, Section 409A, imposing new requirements on deferred compensation arrangements. Apart from changes required by Section 409A, the terms of the Plan will be modeled on our current deferred compensation plan (the ""), a copy of which has been previously filed. The Pre-2005 Plan will be "frozen" after December 31, 2004, meaning that no additional compensation deferrals will be permitted under that plan after 2004. The new Plan will apply to compensation earned after December 31, 2004.
Plan
Pre-2005 Plan
     Employees who are expected to earn $150,000 or more in base salary in the calendar year for which the deferral election is to be made are eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition, any other employee who is expected to earn between $100,000 and $150,000 in base salary in the calendar year for which the deferral election is to be made can participate in the Plan if he or she participated in our Pre-2005 Plan. An eligible employee may elect to defer up to 100% of his or her base salary and bonus. Certain aspects of the Plan will not be finalized until after the U.S. Treasury department provides further guidance on the new Section 409A. However, the Plan is expected to be substantially similar to the Pre-2005 Plan except that:
     The other plan authorized and approved by our Board of Directors on November 18, 2004 is the Dean Foods Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the ""), for the benefit of our employees who receive salary and cash bonus in excess of the amount which Internal Revenue Service regulations allow to be taken into account under a 401k plan (""). Under this new SERP, beginning in 2005, each employee who receives Excess Compensation will be credited with an amount equal to 4% of his or her Excess Compensation. Each employee's plan balance will be paid to him or her upon termination of employment, a change in control of our company, or the employee's death or disability.
SERP
Excess Compensation
     Our Board of Directors authorized and directed the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to finalize both the Plan and the SERP consistent with applicable law.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
     On November 18, 2004, our Board of Directors adopted resolutions approving (1) the cessation of compensation deferrals under the Pre-2005 Plan for compensation earned after December 31, 2004, and (2) the continuation of the Pre-2005 Plan as a frozen plan after 2004. The Board of Directors authorized and directed the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to adopt any amendments to the Pre-2005 Plan as it deems appropriate in order to continue it as a frozen plan.
