Exhibit 99.1
 
     DALLAS, February 10, 2005  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the company earned $0.64 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, compared with $0.54 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter totaled $98.9 million, compared with $86.5 million in the prior year fourth quarter.
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.64, compared with $0.56 in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter grew 10% to $98.8 million compared with adjusted net income of $89.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.
     "We are encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter," said Gregg Engles, chairman and chief executive officer. "We delivered 14% adjusted earnings per share growth for the quarter and enter 2005 with significant momentum. Our consolidated Branded Products Group, which we have renamed White Wave Foods, continued to see robust growth in our most important brands. In addition, our Dairy Group continued to expand its market presence, posting 2.7% volume growth for fresh fluid milk and cream in the quarter. We believe these results, combined with the ongoing consolidation of White Wave Foods and the planned spin-off of our Specialty businesses, position us to create significant shareholder value in the coming year."
     Net sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2003, due primarily to the acquisitions of Horizon Organic and Ross-Swiss Dairies, the increased selling prices resulting from the pass through of increases in raw milk and butterfat costs and continued strong volume growth at the Dairy Group and White Wave Foods.
 
     Consolidated operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $202.1 million versus $183.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Adjusted fourth quarter operating income totaled $202.4 million, an increase of 7% over adjusted operating income of $189.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Adjusted 2004 operating income margins were 7.25%, down 29 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decline in consolidated margins was due primarily to cost increases in raw milk, butterfat, and other key inputs, including resin.
     Long-term debt at December 31, 2004 was approximately $3.3 billion, including $141.2 million due within one year that is reported as part of current liabilities. At the end of the year, approximately $840 million of the company's senior credit facility was available for future borrowings.
     Pursuant to the company's share repurchase authorization, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $29.70 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $39.7 million. Approximately $118 million remains available for spending under the share repurchase program.
OUTLOOK FOR 2005
     "Entering 2005 we are expecting consolidated full year net sales of approximately $10.6 billion, including approximately $700 million from the specialty business," said Engles. "We expect adjusted consolidated operating income, including Specialty, to grow 5% to 8% to a range of $730 million to $750 million in 2005. Our Dairy Group operating income is expected to be relatively flat compared to last year, while we expect operating income increases at White Wave Foods and a partial recovery in operating income from the Specialty segment and Leche Celta. Including the Specialty segment, we expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 in 2005, a growth rate of between 9% and 14% over 2004."
     On a quarterly basis, the company expects to report earnings per share between $0.41 and $0.43 in the first quarter, $0.54 to $0.56 in the second quarter, $0.58 to $0.61 in the third quarter and $0.67 to $0.70 in the fourth quarter. All earnings estimates exclude the anticipated effects of the spin-off of the Specialty unit, including the related transaction expenses. The company's earnings guidance also excludes the impact of stock option expenses, as well as facility closing and reorganization costs and any non-recurring or one-time gains or losses.
SEGMENT RESULTS
     Dairy Group net sales for the fourth quarter rose 7% to $2.2 billion, from $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003. The sales increase was due primarily to the acquisitions of Ross-Swiss Dairies and Milk Products of Alabama, higher raw milk and butterfat costs that were passed along to customers in the form of increased selling
 
prices and a 2.7% increase in fresh fluid milk and cream volumes in the quarter. The fourth quarter average Class I mover, which is an indicator of the company's raw milk costs, averaged $14.50 per hundred-weight in the fourth quarter of 2004, a 2% increase over the same period in 2003. Class II butterfat prices averaged $2.00 per pound in the fourth quarter, 53% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003.
     Dairy Group operating income in the fourth quarter was $153.5 million, a decrease of 5% year over year. Operating margins decreased 90 basis points to 7.0% of sales.
     The new White Wave Foods, which combines the original White Wave company, Horizon Organic and Dean National Brands, reported fourth quarter net sales of $334 million, a 57% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase was driven by the acquisition of Horizon Organic and strong sales growth in the branded portfolio.
     Operating income in the fourth quarter for White Wave Foods increased 125% to $52.0 million, with operating margins of 15.6%, an increase of 470 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter.
     Specialty Foods' net sales in the fourth quarter totaled $174 million, down 3.1% from the fourth quarter of 2003 primarily due to lower pickle volumes and the exit from the nutritional drinks business. Operating income was $19.0 million, a decrease of 24% from the prior year, and operating income margin was 10.9% as compared to 13.9% in the fourth quarter of 2003.
RESULTS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, the company's net sales increased 18% to $10.8 billion, compared with $9.2 billion during 2003. Sales growth was due primarily to higher raw milk and other input prices that were passed on to customers, growth in the branded business, and the Horizon Organic, Kohler Mix Specialties and Ross-Swiss Dairies acquisitions.
     Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $666.9 million versus $766.0 million in 2003. Adjusted operating income for 2004 totaled $695.7 million, a decrease of 2% from adjusted operating income of $709.1 million last year. Adjusted operating margins for the year were 6.4%, versus 7.7% in 2003.
     Net income for 2004 totaled $285.4 million, compared with $355.7 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $1.78, compared with $2.27 in 2003.
 
     Adjusted net income for the year totaled $324.1 million, an increase of 1% over $320.9 million last year. 2004 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.02, as compared to $2.05 in the prior year.
COMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     The adjusted financial information contained in this press release eliminates non-recurring or one-time gains or losses, as well as facility closing and reorganization costs, and is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management. A full reconciliation table between diluted earnings per share according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and on an adjusted basis, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, is attached.
     For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the adjusted results reported above differ from the company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, reorganization, and non-recurring charges:
     For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the adjusted results reported above differ from the company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, reorganization, and non-recurring charges:

     For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the adjusted results reported above differ from the company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, reorganization, and non-recurring charges:
     The adjusted financial results contained in this press release are non- GAAP financial measures that eliminate the net expense or net gain related to the items identified above. These numbers are provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the company's operating performance between periods and to view the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management. Because the company
 
cannot predict the timing and amount of charges associated with facility closings and restructurings or non-recurring items associated with the company's operations, management does not consider facility closing or restructuring costs when evaluating the company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation for management, or in determining earnings estimates. Facility closing and restructuring costs are not recorded in any of the company's operating segments. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP. These non-GAAP numbers may be different than similar measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation table between earnings per share for the three-month and full year periods ended December 31, 2004 calculated according to GAAP and on an adjusted basis is attached.
