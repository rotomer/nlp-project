Item 5.02 .
Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
     On October 14, 2005, we announced that Barry Fromberg will resign from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of our company. In order to ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Fromberg will remain in his position until his successor is selected and our 2005 financial statements have been completed and filed, which we expect to be on or around April 1, 2006. We intend to conduct a search, including both internal and external candidates, for Mr. Fromberg's successor. We expect to enter into an agreement with Mr. Fromberg pursuant to which he will agree to remain in his position until his successor is selected and our 2005 financial statements have been completed and filed, which we expect to be on or around April 1, 2006, and to make himself available to assist with transition issues that may arise after April 1, 2006, in exchange for certain financial consideration.
