Exhibit 99.1
     DALLAS, November 2, 2005  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the Company earned $0.43 per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, as compared to $0.24 per diluted share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2004. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $66.4 million, compared with $37.8 million in the prior year third quarter.
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), diluted earnings from continuing operations increased 22% to $0.50 per share, compared to $0.41 in last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $77.7 million compared to $65.9 million in the third quarter of 2004.
     "Our businesses performed well despite a very challenging environment which included two hurricanes and rapidly rising fuel and resin costs," said Gregg Engles, chairman and chief executive officer. "Consistent with recent trends, our Dairy Group again posted strong volume increases and our WhiteWave division posted strong growth in both net sales and profitability."
     Net sales for the third quarter totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of 2.4% over the third quarter of 2004. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher fluid dairy volumes and increased sales at WhiteWave Foods, which were offset by the pass-through of lower raw milk and butterfat costs in the Dairy Group.
     Consolidated operating income from continuing operations in the third quarter totaled $145.7 million, versus $139.3 million in the third quarter of 2004. Adjusted third quarter operating income from continuing operations totaled $163.7 million, an 8.5% increase over the $150.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2004. The Company's adjusted third quarter 2005 operating margin was 6.2%, up 35 basis points over the third quarter
 
of the prior year. The increase in the adjusted operating income was primarily due to the positive impact of lower raw milk and butterfat costs and increased profitability at WhiteWave Foods, which was partially offset by higher packaging and distribution costs. Included in adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2005 is a $3.9 million charge ($0.02 net of tax), which represents the second half of the total expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock units issued to key employees in January 2003.
     Long-term debt as of September 30, 2005 was approximately $3.1 billion, including $67 million due within one year that is reported as part of current liabilities. At the end of the quarter, approximately $940 million of the Company's senior credit facility was available for future borrowings.
SEGMENT RESULTS
     Dairy Group net sales for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, 1.5% higher than the third quarter of 2004. The sales increase was primarily due to a 3.4% increase in fluid milk volumes that was partially offset by the pass-through of lower raw milk and butterfat costs. The Class I mover, which is an indicator of the Company's raw milk costs, averaged $14.01 per hundredweight in the third quarter of 2005, 10% lower than the same period in 2004.
     Dairy Group operating income in the third quarter was $156.2 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Operating margins increased 22 basis points to 6.9% of sales due primarily to the positive impact of higher raw milk volumes and lower raw milk and butterfat costs, partially offset by higher distribution and packaging costs and the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
     WhiteWave Foods reported third quarter net sales of $284.9 million, a 9.6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2004. The increase was driven by sales growth in most of the Company's core brands.
     Operating income for WhiteWave Foods in the third quarter was $35.9 million, an increase of 41.9% over the $25.3 million reported in the third quarter of 2004. Operating margin for the third quarter of 2005 was 12.6%, an increase of 287 basis points over the prior year third quarter. The improvement in operating income was the result of strong sales growth and increased manufacturing and operating efficiency offset by higher distribution costs due to increased fuel prices.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
OUTLOOK FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 AND FULL YEAR 2006
     "While our businesses continue to demonstrate very strong performance, there are several obvious headwinds affecting our near-term business outlook, including high fuel, energy and packaging costs. We expect between $35 and $40 million higher overall costs related to these items in the fourth quarter of this year than we had last year. We are working hard to mitigate the impact of these increased costs through price increases, but expect near-term operating performance to be negatively impacted by these issues and are therefore adjusting our expectations for the remainder of 2005," said Engles. "We expect fourth quarter earnings of approximately $0.52 to $0.55 per share, resulting in full year 2005 earnings of approximately $1.93 to $1.96 per share, a 14% to 16% increase over 2004 earnings from continuing operations of $1.69 per share. Looking forward to 2006, we believe we will be able to largely mitigate the impact of the higher fuel, energy and resin costs early in the year through price increases on our products. Assuming a relatively stable dairy commodity environment, we expect full year sales of $10.5 billion. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 per diluted share before the effects of stock option expensing."
     In accordance with FAS 123(R), the Company will begin expensing stock options in 2006 and estimates the impact of stock option expensing will be approximately $0.09 to $0.10 per share in 2006, roughly the same as in 2005, had FAS 123(R) been in place.
 
     The Company's earnings guidance excludes the impact of discontinued operations, facility closing and reorganization costs and any non-recurring or one-time gains or losses.
RESULTS FOR NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
     The Company's net sales from continuing operations increased 4.9% to $7.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, compared with $7.4 billion during the first nine months of 2004. The increase was due to sales growth at WhiteWave Foods and volume growth in the Dairy Group, which was partially offset by the pass-through of lower average raw dairy commodity costs. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year totaled $201.8 million, compared with $154.0 million in the first nine months of 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 totaled $1.29, compared with $0.95 in the first nine months of 2004.
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), net income for the nine months totaled $220.3 million, an increase of 18% over $186.7 million in the same period of 2004. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $1.41 compared with $1.15 in the first nine months of 2004, an increase of 23%.
     The Company reported operating income from continuing operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 of $447.1 million versus $410.0 million in the same period of 2004. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of 2005 totaled $477.0 million, an increase of 11.1% versus $429.2 million in the same period of last year. Adjusted operating income margins for the nine months were 6.11%, an increase of 35 basis points versus the prior year's first nine months.
COMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     The adjusted financial results contained in this press release are from continuing operations and are adjusted to eliminate the net expense or net gain related to the items identified below. These numbers are provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's operating performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as company management. Because the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges associated with non-recurring items or facility closings and reorganizations, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation for management, or in determining earnings estimates. These costs are not recorded in any of the Company's operating segments. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP. These non-GAAP numbers may be different than similar measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation table between earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 calculated according to GAAP and on an adjusted basis is attached.
 
     For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding an $18.0 million charge ($11.3 million net of tax) primarily related to the closure of a facility in Union, NJ and the consolidation of WhiteWave Foods Company.
