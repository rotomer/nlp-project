Exhibit 99.1
     DALLAS, February 8, 2006  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the Company earned $0.49 per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, compared with $0.55 per diluted share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter totaled $70.7 million, compared with $85.2 million in the prior year fourth quarter.
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), diluted earnings per share were $0.54, a decrease of 2% from $0.55 in last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $78.0 million compared with adjusted net income of $84.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, a decrease of 8%.
     "In light of the challenges caused by two major hurricanes and the resulting dislocation of energy and packaging costs, the Dairy Group and WhiteWave businesses both turned in solid performances in the fourth quarter and we are entering 2006 with positive momentum," said Gregg Engles, chairman and chief executive officer. "During the quarter, our Dairy Group grew fluid milk volumes by 1.4%. WhiteWave Foods posted strong sales growth of 10% and achieved significant milestones toward the consolidation and integration of its businesses. The combination of our Dairy Group's momentum and the strong sales trends and operational improvements at WhiteWave make us optimistic as we enter the new year."
     Net sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 4% over the fourth quarter of 2004, due to strong sales growth at the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods.
     Consolidated operating income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter totaled $160.0 million versus $177.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 5.94%, as compared to 6.85% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted fourth quarter operating income totaled
 
     $171.9 million, a decrease of 3% from $176.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adjusted fourth quarter operating margin was 6.38%, down 45 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the prior year.
     Long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was approximately $3.4 billion, including $108 million due within one year that is reported as part of current liabilities. At the end of the year, approximately $630 million of the Company's senior credit facility was available for future borrowings.
SEGMENT RESULTS
     Dairy Group net sales for the fourth quarter rose 3% to $2.3 billion, from $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004. The sales increase was due primarily to a 1.4% increase in fluid milk volumes. Those increases were offset somewhat by the pass through of lower dairy commodity costs to our customers. The fourth quarter average Class I mover, which is an indicator of the Company's raw milk costs, averaged $14.13 per hundred-weight, a 3% decrease from the same period in 2004. Class II butterfat prices averaged $1.65 per pound in the fourth quarter, 18% lower than the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Dairy Group segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $164.1 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Dairy Group operating margin increased 20 basis points to 7.20% of sales. Segment operating income growth was driven by increased fluid milk volumes and operational efficiencies from the Company's ongoing plant rationalization activities. The Dairy Group continues, however, to be adversely impacted by historically high commodity costs and the lingering effects of Hurricane Katrina.
     WhiteWave Foods reported fourth quarter net sales of $317 million, a 10% increase compared to fourth quarter 2004 net sales of $287 million. The increase was driven by strong sales growth in the branded portfolio, particularly in our Silk, Horizon Organic, and International Delight brands.
     Segment operating income in the fourth quarter for WhiteWave Foods was $38.2 million, with operating margins of 12.04%, compared to $42.0 million, and operating margins of 14.61% in the prior year fourth quarter. Segment operating income declined due to high input costs, including soybeans, raw organic milk, energy and packaging, as well as one-time costs due to the transition the manufacturing of certain products from Dairy Group facilities to dedicated WhiteWave Foods facilities.
     Corporate and Other sales were $97.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, 1% lower than in the same period of the prior year. Corporate and Other operating loss was $30.4 million, $11.1 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. This is due primarily to higher employee costs, professional and consulting fees and an operating loss in the Company's Leche Celta business in Spain. Leche Celta's results were negatively impacted
 
by a transportation workers strike, continued unfavorable input commodity costs and a competitive retail environment.
RECENT EVENTS
OUTLOOK FOR 2006
     "Consistent with our previous guidance for 2006, we are expecting consolidated net sales of approximately $10.5 billion," said Engles. "Because the dilution from accelerated vesting of restricted stock offsets the accretion from our fourth quarter stock buyback, we are reiterating our 2006 earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 per share before stock option expense. Deducting stock option expense of approximately $0.10 per share results in earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.15, following adoption of FAS 123-R. This represents growth of 15% to 18% over restated 2005 earnings of $1.82 per share restated for the adoption of FAS 123-R."
     The Company expects to report adjusted earnings per share between $0.39 and $0.41 in the first quarter of 2006, or 5% to 11% over the $0.37 reported in the first quarter of 2005 on a comparable basis. The Company's earnings guidance excludes the impact of any facility closing and reorganization costs and non-recurring or one-time gains or losses that may occur in 2006.
 
RESULTS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company's net sales increased 5% to $10.5 billion, compared with $10.0 billion in 2004. Sales growth was due primarily to strong volume growth in the Dairy Group, which was somewhat offset by the passthrough of lower overall dairy commodity costs, and continued strong sales trends at WhiteWave Foods.
     Operating income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $607.1 million versus $587.4 million in 2004. Adjusted operating income for 2005 totaled $648.8 million, an increase of 7% over adjusted operating income of $606.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margins for the year were 6.18%, versus 6.04% in 2004.
     Net income from continuing operations for 2005 totaled $272.5 million, compared with $239.2 million reported in 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $1.78, compared with $1.49 in 2004.
     Adjusted net income for the year totaled $298.4 million, an increase of 10% over $271.5 million in 2004. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $1.94, an increase of 15% over the $1.69 reported in the prior year.
COMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     The adjusted financial results contained in this press release are from continuing operations and are adjusted to eliminate the net expense or net gain related to the items identified below. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's operating performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as company management. Because the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges associated with non-recurring items or facility closings and reorganizations, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation for management, or in determining earnings estimates. These costs are not recorded in any of the Company's operating segments. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP. These non-GAAP numbers may be different than similar measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation table between earnings per share for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005 calculated according to GAAP and on an adjusted basis is attached.
