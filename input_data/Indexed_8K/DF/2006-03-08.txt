Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On March 3, 2006, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved amendments to the performance criteria contained in our Executive Incentive Compensation Plan. Pursuant to the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, executive officers are eligible to receive 0% to 200% of their target bonuses, depending on the level of achievement of the performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee changed the performance criteria for the CEO from being determined 100% based on financial results, to 80% based on financial results and 20% based on the achievement of individual performance objectives. The performance criteria for the remaining executive officers were changed from being determined 80% based on financial results and 20% based on individual performance objectives to 70% and 30%, respectively. Base salaries and target bonus percentages for 2006 for our Named Executive Officers (as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K) are included in the Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 19, 2005.
