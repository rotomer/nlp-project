The Company and the Guarantors will use their respective best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
     (b) The Company and the Guarantors shall prepare a final term sheet, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in a final form approved by you and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
     (c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company and the Guarantors will (i) notify promptly the Representative so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (d) If, at any time when the Final Prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company and the Guarantors promptly will (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the
 
second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use their respective best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.

The Company and the Guarantors will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
     (g) The Company and the Guarantors will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company or any Guarantor be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (h) The Company and the Guarantors agree that, unless they have obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of the Representative, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company and the Guarantors that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a Free Writing Prospectus that contains information in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The
 
Company and the Guarantors agree that (x) they have treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
     (i) Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto.
     (j) The Company and each Guarantor will comply, in all material respects, with all applicable securities and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and to use its best efforts to cause the Company's directors and officers and the Guarantors' directors and officers, in their capacities as such, to comply in all material respects with such laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
     (k) Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
          6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Guarantors contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of their obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

     (e) The Company and the Guarantors shall have furnished to the Representative the opinion or opinions of the Company's General Counsel (or such other
 
in-house legal officer or officers acceptable to the Representative), signed by the General Counsel or such counsel or counsels, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C hereto.
     (f) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representative, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representative), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.

     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company and the Guarantors agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company and the Guarantors will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and each of the Guarantors acknowledges (i) that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), and (iv) the paragraphs related to market making, stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section 8. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would
provided
however
 
present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (1) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (2) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) In the event that any indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters (or, in the case of the Independent Underwriter under paragraph (e), the Independent Underwriter), on the other, severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and the Guarantors and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and by the Underwriters (or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be), on the other, from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder or (ii) the Independent Underwriter, in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Conduct Rule 2720), be responsible for any amount in excess of the compensation received by the Independent Underwriter for acting in such capacity. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters (or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be), on the other, severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters (or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be), on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, and benefits received by
provided
however
 
the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Benefits received by the Independent Underwriter in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" shall be deemed to be equal to the compensation received by the Independent Underwriter for acting in such capacity. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or a Guarantor, on the one hand, or the Underwriters (or the Independent Underwriter, as the case may be), on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or a Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
     (e) Without limitation of and in addition to its obligations under the other paragraphs of this Section 8, the Company and each of the Guarantors agrees, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless the Independent Underwriter, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person who controls the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) Independent Underwriter's acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Conduct Rule 2720) in connection with the offering contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, the Disclosure Package, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, in each case, agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any
 
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.
          9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or any Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Guarantors and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Dean Foods Company 2515 McKinney Avenue Dallas, Texas 75201
Re:
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Dean Foods Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.000% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of May 11, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative of the several Underwriters listed on Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"). The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantees") by those subsidiaries of the Company (each individually a "Guarantor" and collectively the "Guarantors"), from time to time party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 13, 2004, among the Company, the Guarantors, Wachovia Bank, National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Harris Trust and Savings Bank, SunTrust Bank and the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, as amended, and as it may be amended or restated from time to time. The term "Securities" as used herein shall mean the Notes and the related Guarantees. The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture to be entered into among the Company, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and supplemented by a supplemental indenture no. 1 to be entered into among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
     As such counsel, we have assisted in the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") of the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-130309) filed by the Company with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on December 14, 2005, as amended by post-effective amendment no.1 (such registration statement, as so amended, the "Registration Statement") and the prospectus dated May 9, 2006 relating to the Notes (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 10, 2006 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"), and the prospectus supplement dated May 11, 2006 (the
 
May 11, 2006 Page 2
"Prospectus Supplement"), which update or supplement certain information contained in the Base Prospectus.
     We have examined and relied upon the certificates of incorporation of the Company and the Guarantors (or such other organizational documents as may be applicable to such Guarantors), the by-laws of the Company and the Guarantors (or such other organizational documents as may be applicable to such Guarantors), corporate or other proceedings of the Company and each of the Guarantors regarding the authorization of the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the issuance of the Securities, the corporate records of the Company and each of the Guarantors as provided to us by the Company, the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, certificates of representatives of the Company and each of the Guarantors, certificates of public officials and such other documents, instruments and certificates as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.
     In our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the completeness of all corporate records provided to us, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of each individual signing such documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
     In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that (i) the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture; (ii) the Indenture will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto in substantially the form reviewed by us and will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee; and (iii) the Trustee shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
     We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the state laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America. To the extent that any other laws govern any of the matters as to which we express an opinion herein, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion, without independent investigation, that such laws are identical to the state laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to whether such assumption is reasonable or correct.
     Our opinions below are qualified to the extent that they may be subject to or affected by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, usury, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) duties and standards imposed on creditors and parties to contracts, including, without limitation, requirements of materiality, good faith, reasonableness and fair dealing, and (iii) general equitable principles. Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the availability of any equitable or specific remedy
 
May 11, 2006 Page 3
upon any breach of the Indenture or the Securities, or to the successful assertion of any equitable defenses, inasmuch as the availability of such remedies or the success of any equitable defenses may be subject to the discretion of a court. We also express no opinion herein with respect to compliance by the Company with the securities or Blue Sky laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States or of any foreign jurisdiction. In addition, we express no opinion and make no statement herein with respect to the antifraud laws of any jurisdiction.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The Indenture has been duly authorized and, when duly executed and delivered by the Company and each of the Guarantors, as the case may be, will constitute the valid and binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms.
     2. The Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed and delivered by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to, and paid for by, the Underwriters, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
     3. The Guarantees have been duly authorized and, when the Guarantees have been duly executed and delivered by each of the Guarantors and when the Notes have been authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to, and paid for by, the Underwriters, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms.
     Please note that we are opining only as to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion should be inferred as to any other matters. This opinion is based upon currently existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
 
May 11, 2006 Page 4
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed on or about May 17, 2006, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and to the use of our name therein and in the related Base Prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving such consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.
Very truly yours,
WILMER CUTLER PICKERING HALE AND DORR LLP
