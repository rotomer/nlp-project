Exhibit 99.1
     DALLAS, August 2, 2006  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the Company earned $0.53 per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, an increase of 13% from $0.47 per diluted share from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2005. On an adjusted basis (as defined below), diluted earnings per share were $0.55, an increase of 15% from $0.48 in last year's second quarter.
     Consolidated operating income in the second quarter totaled $171.3 million, an increase of 7% from $159.7 million in the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted second quarter operating income totaled $174.2 million, an increase of 7% from $162.2 million in the second quarter of 2005. The adjusted second quarter operating margin was 7.0%, up 58 basis points versus the second quarter last year.
     "I am pleased with the direction and momentum of our businesses," said Gregg Engles, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our Dairy Group continues to outperform the industry, increasing marketshare and growing operating profits. At WhiteWave, our brands continue to demonstrate robust growth, and we believe our supply chain and information technology initiatives are on track to deliver significant operating benefits in the future."
     Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter totaled $74.8 million, compared with $74.0 million in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $76.6 million, versus $75.5 million reported in the second quarter of 2005.
     Net sales for the second quarter totaled $2.5 billion, a decrease of 1% from the second quarter of 2005, due to the pass through of lower raw dairy input costs, partially offset by strong volume growth at the Dairy Group and continued strong sales growth at WhiteWave Foods.
 
     Long-term debt at June 30, 2006 was under $3.4 billion, including $182 million due within one year that is reported as part of current liabilities. As of June 30, 2006, approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's senior credit facility was available for future borrowings.
DAIRY GROUP
     Dairy Group net sales were $2.17 billion in the second quarter of 2006, down 2.6% from the prior year second quarter. The sales decrease was due to the pass through of lower dairy input costs that were partially offset by a 2.1% increase in fluid milk volumes. The second quarter Class I mover, which is an indicator of the Company's raw milk costs, averaged $10.98 per hundred-weight, a 23% decrease from the same period in 2005. Class II butterfat prices averaged $1.25 per pound in the second quarter, also 23% lower than the second quarter of 2005.
     Dairy Group segment operating income in the second quarter was $180.5 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Dairy Group operating margin increased 61 basis points to 8.3% of sales. Segment operating income growth was driven by increased fluid milk volumes and operational efficiencies resulting from ongoing plant rationalization activities and productivity initiatives.
WHITEWAVE FOODS
     WhiteWave Foods reported second quarter net sales of $307 million, a 7% increase compared to second quarter 2005 net sales of $288 million. The percentage increase was driven by strong sales growth in the continuing branded portfolio, partly offset by the SKU reduction activities undertaken late in 2005.
     Segment operating income in the second quarter for WhiteWave Foods was $30.0 million, with operating margins of 9.8%, compared to $28.6 million, and operating margins of 10.0% in the prior year second quarter. WhiteWave operating income increased due to strong sales growth and increased operational efficiencies that were partially offset by investments in information technology and support infrastructure and higher organic milk, sugar and fuel costs.
CORPORATE AND OTHER
     Corporate expense was $36.2 million in the second quarter of 2006, 4% lower than in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to lower share-based compensation expenses.
     The Company reclassified its Iberian operations as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2006. The Company has made the strategic decision to sell the business. The sale of the Iberian operations will represent the
 
last major piece in the Company's ongoing efforts to focus on its largest opportunities. The Iberian operations were previously reported as a part of the Corporate and Other segment. In conjunction with this reclassification, the Company took a $46.4 million impairment charge, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, in the second quarter. The reclassification will increase 2005 adjusted earnings from continuing operations by one cent to $1.83 per share and is expected to be roughly neutral to 2006 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.
RECENT EVENTS
OUTLOOK FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006
     "We have strong momentum as we enter the second half of the year and 2006 is on track to be another strong year for Dean Foods," said Engles. "We are reiterating our full year guidance for earnings to be $2.10 to $2.15 per share compared to 2005 earnings of $1.83 per share. For the third quarter, we are expecting earnings of approximately $0.54 to $0.56 per share."
RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006
     The Company's net sales from continuing operations decreased slightly to $5.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2006. The decrease was due to the pass through of lower raw dairy commodity costs which were offset by sales growth at WhiteWave Foods and volume growth in the Dairy Group. Net income from continuing operations for the first half of the year totaled $129.5 million, compared with $124.7 million in the first six months of 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $0.92, compared to $0.80 for the first six months of 2005.
 
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), net income from continuing operations for the six months totaled $134.0 million, compared to $132.0 million in the same period of 2005. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first six months of 2006 totaled $0.95 compared with $0.84 in the first six months of 2005.
COMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     The adjusted financial results contained in this press release are from continuing operations and are adjusted to eliminate the net expense or net gain related to the items identified below. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's operating performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as company management. Because the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges associated with non-recurring items or facility closings and reorganizations, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation for management, or in determining earnings estimates. These costs are not recorded in any of the Company's operating segments. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP. These non-GAAP numbers may be different than similar measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation table between earnings per share for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2005 calculated according to GAAP and on an adjusted basis is attached.
     For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, reorganization and non-recurring charges:
     For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, reorganization and non-recurring charges:
