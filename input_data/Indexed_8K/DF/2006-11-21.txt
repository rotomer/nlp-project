All such examinations and visits shall be at the sole cost of such Seller Party; provided, however, that (i) for so long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the result of the immediately preceding examination and/or visit of such Seller Party shall have been reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, such cost shall be borne by such Seller Party not more than twice per calendar year in 2004 and once per calendar year thereafter (although in no event shall the foregoing be construed to limit the Agent or its agents or representatives to one such examination and/or visit during such calendar year period with respect to such Seller Party, provided, that if the Agent or its agents or representatives fails to make any such examination and/or visit during any calendar year period, any Financial Institution or its agent or representatives may make such examination and/or visit in the Agent's stead).

i
(e)Purchasers' Reliance. Each Seller acknowledges that the Purchasers are entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in reliance upon such Seller's identity as a legal entity that is separate from the Originators.

24 Negative Covenants of The Seller Parties
a
Name Change, Jurisdiction of Organization, Offices, Records and Books of Accounts. Such Seller Party will not change its name, identity, corporate or other organizational structure or jurisdiction of organization (within the meaning of Sections 9-503 and/or 9-507 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) or relocate its chief executive office, principal place of business or any office where Records are kept unless it shall have: (i) given the Agent at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice thereof and (ii) delivered to the Agent all financing statements, instruments and other documents requested by the Agent in connection with such change or relocation.

fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
c
Modifications to Writings, Contracts and Credit and Collection Policies. Such Seller Party will not, and will not permit any Originator to, make any change to such Originator's Credit and Collection Policy that could materially (either individually or in the aggregate) adversely affect the collectibility of the Receivables or materially (either individually or in the aggregate) decrease the credit quality of any newly created Receivables. Except as provided in Section 8.2(d), the Servicers will not, and will not permit any Originator to, extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Receivable or the Writing or Contract related thereto other than in accordance with such Originator's Credit and Collection Policy.
d
Sales, Liens. No Seller will sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including, without limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to, any Receivable, Related Security or Collections, or upon or with respect to the Writing or Contract under which any Receivable arises, or any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other than, in each case, the creation of the interests therein in favor of the Agent and the Purchasers provided for herein), and each Seller will defend the right, title and interest of the Agent and the Purchasers in, to and under any of the foregoing property, against all claims of third parties claiming through or under such Seller or any Originator. No Seller will create or suffer to exist any mortgage, pledge, security interest, encumbrance, lien, charge or other similar arrangement on any of its inventory, the financing or lease of which gives rise to any Receivable. Notwithstanding this Section 7.2(d), so long as no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event exists, the Sellers collectively may, at their discretion and in a single transaction occurring on a single day, sell all of the Fleming Receivables to White Wave, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("White Wave"); provided that no later than 3 Business Days after such sale, each Seller shall deliver to the Agent a certificate executed by an Authorized Officer of such Seller (A) stating that, with respect to all Fleming Receivables sold in such sale, (I) neither Seller nor any Servicer (in its capacity as Servicer hereunder) has made, and neither Seller nor the Servicer (in its capacity as Servicer hereunder) will make, any representations or warranties in connection with such sale of Fleming Receivables, (II) both before and after giving effect to such sale, no Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event exists, (III) White Wave has, and will have, no recourse to the Seller or the assets of the Seller (other than the Fleming Receivables subject to such sale), (IV) such sale is solely to (x) enable White Wave to further sell such Fleming Receivables through an
 
fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement

Upon any such sale of the Fleming Receivables in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.2(d) and the Sellers' receipt of the purchase price therefor in immediately available funds in a Collection Account and Agent's receipt of the certificate described above, such Fleming Receivables shall be automatically released without any further action by any party hereto from the security interest granted to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Purchasers pursuant to Section 14.14(b). For the avoidance of doubt, each party hereto agrees that the purchase price paid upon any such sale of Fleming Receivables shall constitute Collections hereunder and shall be applied in accordance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Article II.
e
Net Receivables Balance. At no time prior to the Amortization Date shall any Seller permit the Net Receivables Balance to be less than an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Aggregate Capital plus (ii) the Aggregate Reserves.

fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, any Dean Entity, any Additional Entity or any New Entity. If at any time following an Amortization Event the Agent shall designate as Servicer any Person other than National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, any Dean Entity, any Additional Entity or any New Entity, all duties and responsibilities theretofore delegated by National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, any Dean Entity, any Additional Entity or any New Entity to any Seller may, at the discretion of the Agent, be terminated forthwith on notice given by the Agent to National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, any Dean Entity, any Additional Entity or any New Entity, as applicable, and to the Administrative Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (b), (i) each of National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, each Dean Entity, each Additional Entity and each New Entity shall be and remain primarily liable to the Agent and the Purchasers for the full and prompt performance of all of its duties and responsibilities as a Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Agent and the Purchasers shall be entitled to deal exclusively with National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, each Dean Entity, each Additional Entity and each New Entity in matters relating to the discharge by a Servicer of its duties and responsibilities hereunder.

Each of National Brand, Country Fresh, Land-O-Sun, Southern Foods, GTL, Tuscan Dairies, each Dean Entity, each Additional Entity and each New Entity, at all times that it is a Servicer, shall be responsible for providing any sub-servicer or other delegate of a Servicer with any notice given to a Servicer under this Agreement.
. (b) Each Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable originated by such entity from time to time, all in accordance in all material respects with applicable laws, rules and regulations, with reasonable care and diligence, and in accordance in all material respects with the applicable Originator's Credit and Collection Policy.
Duties of Servicer
 
fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
Each Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all Collections with respect to the Receivables originated by such entity directly to a Lock-Box or Collection Account; provided, however, that to the extent that the Originator (other than a Local Originator) of the Receivable giving rise to such Collections, as applicable, currently permits the Obligor of such Receivable to pay such Collections to a local employee of such Originator, as applicable, such Servicer will insure that such local employees remit such Collections to a local depository account no less frequently than weekly, and within two (2) Business Days of such local employee's deposit of such Collections, such Servicer will cause such Collections to be deposited directly to a Lock-Box or Collection Account. With respect to payments relating to Receivables that are remitted directly to any Servicer, such Servicer will remit such payments (or will cause all such payments to be remitted) directly to a Collection Bank and deposited into a Collection Account within two (2) Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to such remittance, such Servicer will itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Agent and the Purchasers. Each Servicer shall effect a Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VI with each bank party to a Collection Account at any time. Prior to the delivery of any Collection Notice to any Collection Bank, in the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Collection Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the applicable Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security (which identification shall occur no later than two (2) Business Days after such amounts are received therein), such Servicer shall promptly (and, in any event, no later than one (1) Business Day after such identification) remit such items to the Person identified to it as being the owner of such remittances and cause such amounts to be removed from such Lock-Box or Collection Account. From and after the date the Agent delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, the Agent may request that the Servicers, and the Servicers thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to a new depositary account specified by the Agent and, at all times thereafter, each Seller and the Servicers shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections.
 
fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
The Servicers shall administer the Collections with respect to the Receivables originated by each such entity in accordance with the procedures described herein and in Article II. The Servicers shall set aside and hold in trust for the account of Seller and the Purchasers their respective shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II. The Servicers shall, upon the request of the Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Agent, all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of each of the Servicers or the Sellers prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II. If the Servicers shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicers shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for the Purchasers on the second Business Day following receipt by any Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer.
The Servicers may, in accordance with the applicable Originator's Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicers determine to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; provided, however, that such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Charged-Off Receivable or limit the rights of the Agent or the Purchasers under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Amortization Event and until such time as the Aggregate Unpaids have been indefeasibly paid in full, the Agent shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicers to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security.
The Servicers shall hold in trust for the Sellers and the Purchasers all Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Writings and Contracts and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables and shall, as soon as reasonably practicable upon demand of the Agent, deliver or make available to the Agent all such Records, at a place selected by the Agent. The Servicers shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt thereof turn over to the Sellers any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting Receivables. The Servicers shall, from time to time at the request of any Purchaser, furnish to the Purchasers (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for the Purchasers pursuant to Article II.
 
fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to any Originator or any Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor.
. The Agent is authorized at any time to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection Notices. Each Seller hereby agrees that, effective when the Agent delivers such notice, the Agent (for the benefit of the Purchasers) shall have exclusive ownership and sole "control" (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC of all applicable jurisdictions) of each Lock-Box, the Collection Accounts and the amounts on deposit therein. In case any authorized signatory of any Seller whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Each Seller hereby authorizes the Agent, and agrees that the Agent shall be entitled to (i) endorse such Seller's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) enforce the Receivables, the related Writings and Contracts and the Related Security and (iii) take such action as shall be necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Agent rather than the Sellers or any Servicer.
Collection Notices
. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the exercise by the Agent and the Purchasers of their rights hereunder shall not release the Servicers, the Originators or any Seller from any of their duties or obligations with respect to any Receivables or under the related Writings or Contracts.

fourth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
Each Seller represents and warrants to the Agent and the Purchasers that such Seller is currently informed of the financial condition of the other Seller and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Aggregate Unpaids. Each Seller hereby covenants that such Seller will continue to keep informed of the other Seller's financial condition, the financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Aggregate Unpaids.
Each Seller agrees that the Agent and the Purchasers may, in their sole and absolute discretion, select the Receivables of any one of the Sellers for sale or application to the Aggregate Unpaids, without regard to the ownership of such Receivables, and shall not be required to make such selection ratably from the Receivables owned by any of the Sellers.
The provisions of this Section 14.19 are made for the benefit of the Agent, the Purchasers and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all of the Sellers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of the Agent, any Purchasers or any such successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any of the other Sellers or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any of the other Sellers or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Aggregate Unpaids hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 14.19 shall remain in effect until all of the Aggregate Unpaids shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Aggregate Unpaids, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Agent or any Purchaser upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the Sellers, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 14.19 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.

Aggregate Unpaids or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Aggregate Unpaids have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Seller may have against any other Seller with respect to any payments to the Agent or any Purchaser hereunder or under any other Transaction Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Aggregate Unpaids arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Aggregate Unpaids and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Seller, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Aggregate Unpaids shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Seller therefor.
Each of the Sellers hereby agrees that, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event, the payment of any amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any Seller to any other Seller is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of the Aggregate Unpaids. Each Seller hereby agrees that after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Amortization Event or Potential Amortization Event, such Seller will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other Seller owing to such Seller until the Aggregate Unpaids shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such Seller shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Seller as trustee for the Agent and the Purchasers, and such Seller shall deliver any such amounts to the Agent for application to the Aggregate Unpaids in accordance with Article II.
