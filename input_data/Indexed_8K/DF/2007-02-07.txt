Exhibit 99.1
 
     DALLAS, February 7, 2007  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the Company earned $0.56 per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared with $0.48 per diluted share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter totaled $76.3 million, compared with $69.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter.
     On an adjusted basis (as defined below), diluted earnings per share were $0.61, an increase of 17% from $0.52 in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $83.9 million compared with adjusted net income of $75.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 12%.
     "Our fourth quarter was a fitting finish to a very successful year at Dean," said Gregg Engles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Dairy Group grew full year fluid milk volumes by 2% in 2006 and increased operating income by 6%. WhiteWave Foods continued to drive strong top line growth behind our key brands and drove operational efficiencies that resulted in 21% operating income growth for the year. We have significant momentum as we enter 2007 and look forward to another successful year."
     Net sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.6 billion, roughly in-line with net sales for the fourth quarter of 2005, due to strong volume growth at the Dairy Group and sales growth at WhiteWave Foods that was offset by the pass through of lower overall dairy commodity costs.
     Consolidated operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $172.6 million versus $158.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 6.65%, as compared to 6.07% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted fourth quarter operating income totaled $184.9 million, an increase of 10.3%
 
from $167.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The adjusted fourth quarter operating margin was 7.13%, up 72 basis points versus the fourth quarter of the prior year.
     Long-term debt at December 31, 2006 was approximately $3.36 billion, including $484 million due within one year. At the end of the year, approximately $1 billion of the Company's senior credit facility was available for future borrowings.
SEGMENT RESULTS
     Dairy Group net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.2 billion, a 1.7% decrease from $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. The sales decrease was due primarily to the pass-through of lower overall dairy commodity costs to our customers, offset by a 1% increase in fluid milk volumes. The fourth quarter average Class I mover, which is an indicator of the Company's raw milk costs, averaged $12.42 per hundred-weight, a 12% decrease from the same period in 2005. Class II butterfat prices averaged $1.39 per pound in the fourth quarter, 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2005.
     Dairy Group segment operating income in the fourth quarter was $172.1 million, an increase of 4.2% year-over-year. Dairy Group operating margin increased 43 basis points to 7.67% of sales. Segment operating income growth was driven by increased fluid milk volumes, a relatively favorable dairy commodity environment and improved operational efficiencies.
     WhiteWave Foods reported fourth quarter net sales of $350 million, a 5.0% increase compared to fourth quarter 2005 net sales of $333 million.
     Segment operating income in the fourth quarter for WhiteWave Foods was $46.8 million, an increase of 24.6% from the $37.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005. Segment operating margins improved 211 basis points for the quarter to 13.38% due to higher sales volumes and more efficient operations.
CORPORATE
     Corporate and other expenses totaled $34.1 million, a 3% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2005.
RECENT EVENTS
 
OUTLOOK FOR 2007
     "With solid growth in operating income expected from both our business segments this year, we are expecting earnings of $2.33 to $2.38 per share in 2007." said Engles. "This represents growth of 10% to 12% over 2006 adjusted earnings."
     The Company expects to report adjusted earnings per share between $0.44 and $0.46 in the first quarter of 2007, or 10% to 15% over the $0.40 reported in the first quarter of 2006. The Company's earnings guidance excludes the impact of any facility closing and reorganization costs and non-recurring or one-time gains or losses that may occur in 2007.
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006
     For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company's net sales decreased 0.7% to $10.1 billion. Strong sales growth at WhiteWave Foods and volume growth in the Dairy Group were offset by the pass-through of lower dairy commodity costs to customers.
     Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $650.7 million versus $580.1 million in 2005. Adjusted operating income for 2006 totaled $675.8 million, an increase of 9.2% over adjusted operating income of $618.7 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating margins for the year were 6.69%, versus 6.08% in 2005.
     Net income from continuing operations for 2006 totaled $280.3 million, compared with $256.7 million reported in 2005. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $2.01, compared with $1.67 in 2005.
 
     Adjusted net income for the year totaled $295.7 million, an increase of 5% over $280.6 million in 2005. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $2.12, an increase of 16% over the $1.83 reported in the prior year.
COMPARISON OF ADJUSTED INFORMATION TO GAAP INFORMATION
     The adjusted financial results contained in this press release are from continuing operations and are adjusted to eliminate the net expense or net gain related to the items identified below. This information is provided in order to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company's operating performance between periods and to view the Company's business from the same perspective as company management. Because the Company cannot predict the timing and amount of charges associated with non-recurring items or facility closings and reorganizations, management does not consider these costs when evaluating the Company's performance, when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources, in determining incentive compensation for management, or in determining earnings estimates. These costs are not presented in any of the Company's operating segments. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP. These non-GAAP numbers may be different than similar measures used by other companies. A full reconciliation table between earnings per share for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2006 calculated according to GAAP and on an adjusted basis is attached.
     For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding a $12.3 million charge ($7.6 million net of income tax) related to the closing of our Akron, OH manufacturing facility and other previously announced facility closings and reorganization charges.
     For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding $8.7 million of charges ($5.4 million net of income tax) related to previously announced facility closings and reorganization charges, including the WhiteWave Foods reorganization.
     For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding $25.1 million of charges ($15.4 million net of income tax) related to the closing of our Akron OH manufacturing facility, the closing of our Union, NJ facility, the closing of our Madison, WI distribution center and other previously announced facility closings and reorganizations.
     For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the adjusted results reported above differ from the Company's results under GAAP by excluding the following facility closing, and reorganization charges:
