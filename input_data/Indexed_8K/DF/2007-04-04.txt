Under the Credit Agreement, the Company also has the right to request an increase of the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility and to request incremental term loans under the Tranche A Term Loan Facility or Tranche B Term Loan Facility by up to $500,000,000 without the consent of any Lenders not participating in such increase, subject to specified conditions.
The following description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement referred to below, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.

In the ordinary course of business, certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking and/or investment banking transactions with the Company and its affiliates for which they have in the past received, and may in the future receive, customary fees.
Receivables Facility
On April 2, 2007, the Company's subsidiaries that are party to its receivables-backed facility entered into an amendment to the facility pursuant to which the liquidity termination date was extended from November 15, 2007 to April 2, 2008 and the facility termination date was extended from November 15, 2009 to April 2, 2010. The amendment also modified the individual obligor concentration limit, which the Company expects will slightly increase its borrowing capacity under the facility. The amended facility, the Fifth Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, is entered into by and among (1) Dairy Group Receivables, L.P., Dairy Group Receivables, II and WhiteWave Receivables, L.P., all of which are the Company's subsidiaries, (2) the financial institutions that are party to the Company's Receivables Purchase Agreement, (3) JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, as agent, and (4) the Company, as provider of certain performance undertakings on behalf of our subsidiaries.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
In connection with the Special Dividend, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved adjustments to outstanding stock option awards and restricted stock units pursuant to the Company's equity-based compensation plans. Stock options were adjusted by changing the exercise price and increasing the number of options under the awards such that the fair market value of the award, determined using the Black-Scholes model, would be the same before and after the Special Dividend. The number of restricted stock units was also adjusted to maintain the same value before and after the Special Dividend.

Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
          (c) . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit or such later date as may be agreed to by the relevant Issuing Bank (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.
Expiration Date
          (d) .

If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.

Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
provided

          (f) . The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant

Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
          (g) . Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
          (h) . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
Replacement of any Issuing Bank
 
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
          (j) . If the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated in accordance with Article VII, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the ""), an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account.

Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all such Events of Defaults have been cured or waived.

provided
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
          SECTION 2.08. . (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to elect an Interest Period for LIBOR Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a LIBOR Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a LIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or each Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or make any indemnity payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender (and the Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment).

Upon any assignment by any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.20 becoming effective, the Replacement Lender shall thereupon be deemed to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement (unless such Replacement Lender was, itself, a Lender prior thereto) and such Departing Lender shall thereupon cease to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 and Section 9.03) while such Departing Lender was a Lender.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any such bank.

Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto.
          The Borrower, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, and each Lender, on its behalf and on the behalf of its affiliated Holders of Secured Obligations, hereby irrevocably constitute the Administrative Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Qubec) in order to hold hypothecs and security granted by the Borrower or any Subsidiary on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, and agree that the Administrative Agent may act as the bondholder and mandatary with respect to any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness that may be issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and pledged in favor of the Holders of Secured Obligations in connection with this Agreement.

This Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of all of the Obligations of each Originator under the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by any such Originator pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that any Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by any Originator to such Recipient (including any Purchaser) from any other Person or resort to any collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Recipient (including any Purchaser) in favor of any Originator or any other Person or other means of obtaining payment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the collection of any of the Receivables and Provider shall not be responsible for any Obligations to the extent the failure to perform such Obligations by such Originator results from Receivables being uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; , that nothing herein shall relieve such Originator from performing in full its Obligations under the Agreements or Provider of its undertaking hereunder with respect to the full performance of such duties.

Provider's Further Agreements to Pay
     Section 4. . Provider waives notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted by any Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any requirement that any Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, other default or omission by any Originator or asserting any other rights of a Recipient under this Undertaking. Provider warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from such Originator, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Originator, and that it is not relying on any Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future. Provider also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral.

Waivers by Provider
 
fifth amended and restated
receivables purchase agreement
any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment Obligations of such Originator or any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking even though such Recipient (or its assigns) might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment Obligations of such Originator or to amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Provider may have at any time against such Originator in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of such Originator to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether or not Provider shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this .
Section 4
     Section 5. . Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of any Originator or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Originator; (b) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Obligations; (c) the failure of any Originator or Provider to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Originator for any other reason other than final payment in full of the payment Obligations in accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be binding on Provider and shall constitute the primary obligation of Provider. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Provider.

No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.

sums against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking, whether or not such Recipient (or any such assign) shall have made any demand under this Undertaking and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
     Section 12. . All payments to be made by Provider hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If Provider is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, any Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no deduction or withholding been made.

No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.

Setoff
     Section 12. . All payments to be made by Provider hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If Provider is required by law to
Taxes
 
fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement

     Section 13. . Provider agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of any Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Provider as such Recipient may reasonably request.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until the Obligations are paid in full, Provider: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of any Recipient, the Agent or any Purchaser against any Originator, (b) hereby waives all rights of subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or in equity or otherwise) to the claims of each Recipient (including each Purchaser) against any Originator and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and "claims" (as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code) which Provider might now have or hereafter acquire against such Originator that arise from the existence or performance of Provider's obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against any Originator in respect of any liability of Provider to such Originator and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by any Recipient (including any Purchaser). The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of any Originator now or hereafter owed to Provider is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the
Subrogation; Subordination
 
fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement
Obligations. Provider agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, Provider will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Originator to Provider until all of the Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Provider shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Provider as trustee for Recipients (and their respective assigns) and be paid over to Recipients (or their respective assigns) on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Provider under the other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of any Recipient under any separate subordination agreement which such Recipient may at any time and from time to time enter into with Provider.
Section 8
     Section 9. . Provider's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until all Obligations are finally paid and satisfied in full and the Purchase Agreement is terminated, provided, that this Undertaking shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or other satisfaction of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of any Originator or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not any Recipient (or its respective assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.
Termination of Performance Undertaking
     Section 10. . This Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of any Originator and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against any Originator under the federal bankruptcy code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code with respect to any Originator or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which any Originator is subject shall postpone the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.
Effect of Bankruptcy
     Section 11. . Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations, each Recipient (and its respective assigns) is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Provider (any such notice being expressly waived by Provider) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, upon the occurrence of any Amortization Event or Termination Event, to set off and apply any deposits and other sums against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking, whether or not such Recipient (or any such assign) shall have made any demand under this Undertaking and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
Setoff
     Section 12. . All payments to be made by Provider hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If Provider is required by law to
Taxes
 
fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement
make any deduction or withholding on account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, any Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no deduction or withholding been made.
     Section 13. . Provider agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of any Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Provider as such Recipient may reasonably request. Provider also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as any Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of such Recipient hereunder.
Further Assurances
     Section 14. . This Undertaking shall be binding upon Provider, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Recipient and its successors and assigns. Provider may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Recipient. Each Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Recipients herein.
Successors and Assigns
     Section 15. . No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Provider therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Recipient. No failure on the part of any Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
Amendments and Waivers
     Section 16. . All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to Provider, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to any Recipient, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, or at such other addresses as each of Provider or any Recipient may designate in writing to the other.

     Section 19. .

Bankruptcy Petition
     Section 20. . This Undertaking constitutes the entire agreement of Provider with respect to the matters set forth herein. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of Provider hereunder would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of Provider's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by Provider or any Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions of this Undertaking which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Exhibit 99.3
DALLAS, April 2, 2007 Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced the successful recapitalization of its balance sheet through the completion of $4.8 billion of new senior credit facilities and the return of $1.94 billion to shareholders through a $15.00 per share special dividend.
The new facilities consist of a combination of a $1.5 billion 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility, a $1.5 billion 5-year senior secured term loan A, and a $1.8 billion 7-year senior secured term loan B. The Company also replaced its receivables facility with a new three year, $600 million receivables facility. The Company's publicly traded notes will remain outstanding without modification.
The special dividend declared by Dean Foods' Board of Directors was paid today to shareholders of record as of March 27, 2007. Shareholders who sell their shares prior to the April 3, 2007 ex-dividend date will also be selling their right to receive the special dividend. Dean Foods common stock will start trading on an ex-dividend basis beginning tomorrow, April 3, 2007, in accordance with NYSE rules. Shareholders are advised to contact their financial advisor for advice regarding their individual situations.
The total number of basic shares outstanding at the close of trading on the record date of March 27, 2007 was 129.6 million, resulting in a total aggregate dividend of $1.94 billion.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV in early 2008 to notify them of the division between the dividend and non-dividend portions of the special dividend. The process of determining these amounts, which entails a comprehensive review and analysis of the Company's financial history, is well underway. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax and financial advisors regarding the implications of this special dividend.
The $4.8 billion fully underwritten financing package was arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC..
