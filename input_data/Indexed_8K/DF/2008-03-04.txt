No notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act has been received by the Company. No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the Applicable Time, became
 
effective upon filing. The Company will file with the Commission the Prospectus relating to the Stock in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, the Prospectus shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Underwriter shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Applicable Time or, to the extent not completed at the Applicable Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the Applicable Time, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, at the Applicable Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x).
     (b) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Prospectus is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and at the Applicable Time, the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf the Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
provided
however
     (c) The Disclosure Package does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8 hereof.
     (d) The documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the Registration Statement, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable. Any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the Registration Statement or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will
 
conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable.

     (f) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Stock and (ii) as of the Applicable Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), the Company was not and is not an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an Ineligible Issuer.

     (e) The Company will furnish to the Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriter, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by the Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Underwriter may reasonably
 
request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
     (f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Stock for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriter may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Stock and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Stock, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (g) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of the Underwriter, and the Underwriter agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Stock that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Underwriter or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) they have complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
     (h) For a period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the 60th day after the date of the Prospectus (the "Lock-Up Period"), the Company will not, directly or indirectly, (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than the Stock and shares issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, qualified stock option plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof or pursuant to currently outstanding options or rights not issued under one of those plans, or sell or grant options, rights or warrants with respect to any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than the grant of options pursuant to option plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof), (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such shares of Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, (3) file or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments, with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into Common Stock or any other securities of the Company (other than any registration statement on Form S-8) or (4) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing,
 
in each case without the prior written consent of the Underwriter, and to cause each officer of the Company set forth on Schedule II hereto to furnish to the Underwriter, prior to the Closing Date, a letter or letters, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Lock-Up Agreements").
     (i) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Stock being sold by the Company as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
     (j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Stock.
          6. . The obligations of the Underwriter to purchase the Stock shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriter

     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened;

     (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriter the opinion or opinions of Steven J. Kemps, the Company's General Counsel (or such other in-house legal officer or officers acceptable to the Underwriter), signed by the General Counsel or such counsel or counsels, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriter, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C hereto.
     (f) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Underwriter, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Underwriter), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Base Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (f) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the
 
condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Underwriter, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Stock as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (i) The New York Stock Exchange shall have approved the Stock for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance.

     All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriter.
          7. . If the sale of the Stock provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriter set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriter, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by the Underwriter in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Stock.
Reimbursement of Underwriter's Expenses
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Underwriter and each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are
Indemnification and Contribution
 
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
     (b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its directors and officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges (i) that the last statement set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) the first and last paragraphs under the caption "Stabilization and Short Positions" under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriter for inclusion in the Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in,
provided
however
 
or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (1) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (2) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) In the event that any indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and the Underwriter may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by the Underwriter, on the other, from the offering of the Stock. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriter, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, and benefits received by the Underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), (i) in no case shall the Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Stock purchased by the Underwriter hereunder and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company
 
within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriter, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Stock, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or the settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other material adverse change in financial markets or calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Underwriter, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Stock as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
          10. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriter set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, the Company, or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Stock. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Successors
          13. . The Company acknowledges that the Underwriter's research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from its investment banking division and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that the Underwriter's research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the

offering that differ from the views of its investment banking division. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriter with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by its independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by the Underwriter's investment banking division. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriter is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
          14. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriter is acting as principal and not as an advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriter in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity, and (d) the Underwriter and its affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the Underwriter has no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether the Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will waive any claim that it may have that the Underwriter has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No Fiduciary Duty
          15. . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriter, or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Dean Foods Company 2515 McKinney Avenue, Suite 1200 Dallas, Texas 75201
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the public offering by Dean Foods Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), of 18,700,327 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Shares") pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149439) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") on February 28, 2008 and the prospectus supplement, dated February 29, 2008, to the prospectus dated February 28, 2008 included in the Registration Statement.
     The Shares are to be sold by the Company pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") entered into between the Company and Lehman Brothers Inc.
     We are acting as counsel for the Company in connection with the sale by the Company of the Shares. We have examined signed copies of the Registration Statement as filed with the Commission. We have also examined and relied upon the Underwriting Agreement, resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company and committees thereof, minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us by the Company, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, each as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth.
     In our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents and the legal competence of all signatories to such documents.
     We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the state laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America.
 
Dean Foods Company February 29, 2008 Page 2
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares to be issued and sold by the Company have been duly authorized for issuance and, when such Shares are issued and paid for in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, such Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
