Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DALLAS, February 11, 2009  Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that the Company earned $0.43 per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 79% from the $0.24 per diluted share from continuing operations earned in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $67.4 million, compared with $32.6 million in the prior year's fourth quarter.
On an adjusted basis (as defined below), fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.46, a 70% increase over the $0.27 per adjusted diluted share earned in the prior year's fourth quarter. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $71.3 million, compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $37.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increases in adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share were driven by a 31% increase in DSD Dairy segment operating profit, a 14% increase in WhiteWave-Morningstar segment operating profit, and lower interest expense as a result of the reduction in total debt outstanding, offset by higher Corporate expense and increased diluted shares outstanding.
"By many measures, the fourth quarter of 2008 was the strongest in our history," commented Gregg Engles, Chairman and CEO. "Consolidated adjusted operating income was 27% above the fourth quarter of 2007. Both business units turned in solid performances with DSD Dairy operating profit 31% above year ago levels and WhiteWave-Morningstar operating profit up 14% in the quarter. Consistent with the trends we were seeing as we exited the third quarter, commodities continued to be favorable in the fourth quarter, particularly energy related commodities, which, combined with operational improvements across the business, bolstered our financial results in the period."

DEAN FOODS FOURTH QUARTER 2008 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Total net sales for the fourth quarter totaled $3.1 billion, 5% below total net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales decreased in the quarter due to the pass-through of lower overall dairy commodity costs that were partially offset by acquisition-aided volume growth in the DSD Dairy segment and continued net sales growth at WhiteWave-Morningstar.
Consolidated operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $183.6 million, an increase of 29% from $142.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Adjusted fourth quarter consolidated operating income totaled $190.0 million, an increase of 27% from $149.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in adjusted consolidated operating income is due to the strong performance of the DSD Dairy segment, which increased operating profit 31% over the prior year; and the WhiteWave-Morningstar segment, which increased operating profit by 14% over the fourth quarter of 2007, partially offset by increased Corporate expense.
DEAN FOODS FULL YEAR 2008 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% from net sales for the same period of last year, due to stronger volumes in DSD Dairy and increased sales at WhiteWave-Morningstar.
Net income from continuing operations for the full year 2008 totaled $184.8 million, compared with $130.5 million in the previous year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2008 totaled $1.21, compared to $0.95 in 2007.

On an adjusted basis (as defined below), net income from continuing operations for the full year 2008 totaled $199.2 million, compared to $164.5 million in 2007. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year 2008 totaled $1.30 compared to $1.20 in 2007.
"2008 was a year of tremendous progress," continued Mr. Engles. "The business overcame a slow start to post full year adjusted operating income growth of 7%, marking a solid rebound from 2007's results and returning the business to its historical longer-term trend of mid to high-single digit adjusted operating income growth. Fluid milk volumes in the DSD Dairy segment grew 1.5% and full year segment operating profit increased 10%. Sales at WhiteWave-Morningstar were 10% higher than the prior year and segment profit was flat for the year, but improved materially in the fourth quarter."
"Free cash flow for the year was the highest in our history at $462 million. Our strong cash flow combined with our equity offering in February 2008 led to the reduction of $783 million in debt during the year, significantly deleveraging the balance sheet. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year were 8% above 2007 results, despite the modest dilution from our $400 million equity offering in the first quarter."
DSD DAIRY
DSD Dairy net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.37 billion, a 7% decrease from $2.56 billion in net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007. The sales decrease in the quarter was due to the pass-through of lower overall dairy commodity costs offset somewhat by strong volume growth. The fourth quarter average Class I mover, which is an indicator of the Company's raw milk costs, averaged $16.10 per hundred-weight during the fourth quarter, 23% below the same period in 2007. DSD Dairy total volumes increased 2.3% in the quarter. DSD Dairy fluid milk volumes increased by 2.8% in the quarter, compared to a fluid milk category that was up approximately 0.1% on a year over year basis; based on USDA data and company estimates.
DSD Dairy operating income in the fourth quarter was $165.7 million, 31% above the $126.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2007. DSD Dairy results benefitted from declining raw dairy and energy related commodity costs, strong cost controls, and the benefits of the Company's ongoing strategic initiatives.
For the full year, DSD Dairy net sales totaled $9.8 billion, a 4% increase from 2007 net sales of $9.4 billion. The class I mover averaged $18.00 per hundred-weight for the year, down slightly from the $18.14 average price in 2007. Total volumes in the DSD Dairy segment increased 1.7% for the year.

Total year fluid milk volumes increased 1.5% against a category that was approximately flat on a full year basis. Full year DSD operating income was $591.3 million, 10% higher than the $538.0 million recorded in the previous year.
WHITEWAVE  MORNINGSTAR
The WhiteWave-Morningstar segment reported fourth quarter net sales of $707.9 million, 5% higher than fourth quarter 2007 net sales of $672.1 million. The WhiteWave branded portfolio of products increased sales 8% over the prior year period to $419.8 million. Net sales of Morningstar's private label and foodservice cultured and creamer products increased 1.5% over the fourth quarter of 2007 to $288.1 million behind continued strong growth in yogurt, egg nog and cottage cheese sales.
Net sales of milk increased nearly 15% over the year ago period even as the organic milk category showed signs of material slowing within the quarter. net sales increased in the mid single digits, and were impacted by the slowing of sales growth within the soymilk category, as well as the decision to exit an unprofitable foodservice business relationship. net sales grew in the high single digits. portfolio net sales were modestly ahead of last year's fourth quarter results with particular strength in the creamers business offset by the loss of a specialty milk customer.

Segment operating income in the fourth quarter for WhiteWave-Morningstar was $69.4 million, an increase of 14% from $60.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Segment operating margins were 9.8%, compared to 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Segment operating income growth in the quarter was the result of solid sales growth and operational leverage at WhiteWave combined with favorable commodity trends at Morningstar and distribution synergies across the segment. CME butter, a primary input cost for Morningstar, averaged $1.52 per pound in the fourth quarter, 14% above the same period last year, and 6% below the third quarter of 2008.
For the full year, WhiteWave-Morningstar net sales were $2.65 billion, a 10% increase over $2.41 billion in net sales in fiscal 2007. Included in this result, WhiteWave net sales increased 12% to $1.53 billion in 2008 from total net sales of $1.37 billion in 2007 and Morningstar sales increased 8% to $1.12 billion from $1.04 billion in 2007. Full year 2008 operating income for WhiteWave-Morningstar was $205 million, roughly equal to 2007 full year segment operating income, reflecting the difficult commodity environment at Morningstar for much of 2008 and the continued challenges in the organic milk category that have masked operational improvements in the business, particularly at WhiteWave.

CORPORATE EXPENSE
Corporate and other expenses totaled $45.1 million, compared to $38.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in the quarter reflects the continued balancing of tight cost controls with strategic investments in building capabilities and the impact of expensing $6.3 million of transaction related costs. For the full year 2008, Corporate and other expenses totaled $165.2 million, compared to $153.2 million in 2007.
CASH FLOW
Net cash provided by continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $719 million, compared to $350 million in 2007. The increase in net cash provided by continuing operations is due primarily to higher operating results and decreased working capital requirements.
Free cash flow provided by operations in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 totaled $462 million, a $353 million increase over the $109 million in 2007. A reconciliation between net cash provided by continuing operations and free cash flow provided by continuing operations is provided below.
Capital expenditures for the full year 2008 totaled $257 million, compared to $241 million in 2007.
Through the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, total debt outstanding decreased by $783 million. Total debt at December 31, 2008, net of $36 million in cash on hand, was approximately $4.45 billion. The Company's funded debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined by its credit agreements, declined to 4.92x as of the end of the fourth quarter. This compares to a current bank covenant requirement of 5.75x and a year end 2009 step-down in the covenant requirement to 5.0x funded debt to EBITDA.
FORWARD OUTLOOK
"We feel very good about our overall performance in the fourth quarter and the strong recovery of the business in 2008," stated Jack Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. "We have significant momentum in our business as we enter 2009. For the first quarter, we are off to a strong start and are expecting adjusted diluted earnings of at least $0.38 per share. For the full year, we remain very confident in our expectations for delivering mid-teens EPS growth in 2009, which implies adjusted diluted earnings of at least $1.50 per share in 2009. While we have clear tailwinds due to favorable commodities at the moment, real concerns remain. We believe it is prudent to be conservative on our full year outlook due the unpredictable commodity volatility, continuing competitive pressures, an extraordinarily troubled economy, an increase in pension expense of approximately five cents per share versus 2008 and an investment of approximately six cents per share in the Fruit2Day joint venture. We will update you in more detail regarding 2009 and our longer-term outlook at our investor conference in two weeks."
