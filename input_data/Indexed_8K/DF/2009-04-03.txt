(iii) for any Purchaser Interest purchased by the CL Company and funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper, for any day, the sum of (i) discount or yield accrued on Pooled Commercial Paper on such day, plus (ii) any and all accrued commissions in respect of placement agents and Commercial Paper dealers, and issuing and paying agent fees incurred, in respect of such Pooled Commercial Paper for such day, plus (iii) other costs associated with funding small or odd-lot amounts with respect to all receivable purchase facilities which are funded by Pooled Commercial Paper for such day, minus (iv) any accrual of income net of expenses received on such day from investment of collections received under all receivable purchase facilities funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper, minus (v) any payment received on such day net of expenses in respect of broken funding costs related to the prepayment of any purchaser interest of the CL Company pursuant to the terms of any receivable purchase facilities funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper. In addition to the foregoing costs, if the Administrative Seller shall request any Incremental Purchase during any period of time determined by the CL Company (or by the CL Company's agent on its behalf) in its sole discretion to result in incrementally higher Company Costs with respect to the CL Company applicable to such Incremental Purchase by the CL Company, the Capital associated with any such Incremental Purchase shall, during such period, be deemed to be funded by the CL Company in a special pool (which may include capital associated with other receivable purchase facilities) for purposes of determining such additional Company Costs applicable only to such special pool and charged each day during such period against such Capital. Each Purchaser Interest funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper will accrue Company Costs with respect to the CL Company each day on a pro rata basis, based upon the percentage share the Capital in respect of such Purchaser Interest represents in relation to all assets held by the CL Company and funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper. For each Settlement Period, the CL Company shall calculate its aggregate Company Costs for such Settlement Period and report such Company Costs to the Administrative Seller pursuant to of this Agreement;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such time as the SunTrust Company shall determine that its Company Costs shall be allocated as set forth in (v) hereinabove, the SunTrust Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, allocate Company Costs on a daily basis based upon its funding costs for overnight borrowings in the commercial paper market, as determined by the SunTrust Company Agent on a reasonable basis (such determination to be conclusive, absent manifest error).For each Settlement Period, the SunTrust Company shall calculate its aggregate Company Costs for such Settlement Period and report such Company Costs to the Administrative Seller pursuant to of this Agreement.
