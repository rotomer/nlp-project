Effective April 15, 2009, The Board of Directors of Dean Foods Company (the "Company") made certain changes to its classes of directors. Jim Turner moved from Class II to Class III of the Board, to serve until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation, retirement or removal, and Tom Davis moved from Class I to Class III of the Board, to serve until his successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier resignation, retirement or removal. Mr. Turner and Mr. Davis will each be eligible for re-election at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2010. Such changes were effected in order to comply with the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, which both require the Company to maintain Board classes as nearly equal in number as possible.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
