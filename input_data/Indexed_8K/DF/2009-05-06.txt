Item 8.01 Other Events
On May 5, 2009, Dean Foods Company (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein, to issue and sell 22,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock, $.01 par value per share, in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149439) and a related prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters an option exercisable for 30 days from the date of the prospectus supplement to purchase, at the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions, up to an additional 3,375,000 shares of its common stock to cover overallotments, if any.
The offering was priced at $18.25 per share. The Company expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of approximately $394 million (or approximately $453 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay the $122.8 million aggregate principal amount of its subsidiary's 6.625% senior notes due May 15, 2009, and use the remaining net proceeds to repay indebtedness under its receivables-backed facility.
The above description of the underwriting agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the underwriting agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to the Company, has issued an opinion to the Company, dated May 5, 2009, regarding the legality of the shares of common stock to be issued and sold in the offering upon issuance and sale thereof.

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Stock, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus) to the Base Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. The Company and will cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Stock within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r). The Company will promptly advise each Underwriter (i) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Stock, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2), and (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Stock for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly each Underwriter so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
(c) If, at any time when the Prospectus relating to the Stock is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify each Underwriter of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
(d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to each Underwriter an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
(e) The Company will furnish to each Underwriter and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by the Underwriters or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as each Underwriter may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
(f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Stock for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Stock and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Stock, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(g) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, and each Underwriter agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Stock that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise
 
constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
(h) For a period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the 90th day after the date of the Prospectus (the "Lock-Up Period"), the Company will not, directly or indirectly, (1) offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than the Stock and shares issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, qualified stock option plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof or pursuant to currently outstanding options or rights not issued under one of those plans, or sell or grant options, rights or warrants with respect to any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other than the grant of options pursuant to option plans or other employee compensation plans existing on the date hereof), (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such shares of Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, (3) file or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments, with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable into Common Stock or any other securities of the Company (other than any registration statement on Form S-8) or (4) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing, in each case without the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, and to cause each officer of the Company set forth on Schedule II and each director of the Company to furnish to Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, prior to the Closing Date, a letter or letters, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Lock-Up Agreements").
(i) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Stock being sold by the Company as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Stock.

(b) FINRA shall have raised no objection to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements.
(c) On the Closing Date and any Subsequent Closing Date, the Company shall have requested and caused Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel for the Company, to have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated as of such Closing Date or Subsequent Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, each in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
(d) On the Closing Date and any Subsequent Closing Date, the Representatives shall have received from Sidley Austin LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated as of such Closing Date or Subsequent Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Stock, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened;
(iii) the Company has not received any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2); and
(iv) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business, properties or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f) On the Closing Date and any Subsequent Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives the opinion or opinions of Rachel A.

(g) The Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date and at any Subsequent Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of such Closing Date or Subsequent Closing Date and addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Base Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
(h) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (g) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in
 
any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Stock as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(i) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(j) The New York Stock Exchange shall have approved the Stock for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance.
(k) The Lock-Up Agreements between the Underwriters, on the one hand, and the officers of the Company set forth on Schedule II and the directors of the Company, on the other hand, delivered to the Underwriters on or before the date of this Agreement, shall be in full force and effect on the Closing Date and any Subsequent Closing Date.
All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.
7. . If the sale of the Stock provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by an Underwriter, the Company will reimburse each Underwriter on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by such Underwriter in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Stock.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or the Company's earnings release, dated May 1, 2009, regarding the Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, or arise out of or are based
Indemnification and Contribution
 
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its directors and officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which each Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the second sentence of the first paragraph and the last paragraph under the caption "Price Stabilization and Short Positions" under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus (in each case not including the Base Prospectus), constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in,
provided
however
 
or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (1) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, and (2) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that any indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Stock. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by them, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), (i) in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Stock purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls
 
the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Stock, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or the settlement of such trading generally shall have been materially disrupted or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other material adverse change in financial markets or calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Stock as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
10. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters, the Company, or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Stock. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Successors
13. . The Company acknowledges that each Underwriter's research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from its investment banking division and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that each Underwriter's research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the
Research Analyst Independence
 
offering that differ from the views of its investment banking division. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against each Underwriter with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by its independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by each Underwriter's investment banking division. The Company acknowledges that each Underwriter is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
14. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and each Underwriter and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) each Underwriter is acting as principal and not as an advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, (c) the Company's engagement of each Underwriter in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity, and (d) each Underwriter and its affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that each Underwriter has no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will waive any claim that it may have that any Underwriter has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No Fiduciary Duty
15. . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Integration
16. . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York.
