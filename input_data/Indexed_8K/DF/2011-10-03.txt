In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the LC Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the related Seller of such request. Provided that it shall have received such notice, the related Seller shall reimburse the LC Bank for the full amount of any such drawing (each such obligation, a "Reimbursement Obligation") prior to (i) 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on each date that an amount is paid by the LC Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "Drawing Date"), if Seller shall have received notice of such drawing prior to 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on such Drawing Date or (ii) 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Business Day immediately following the Drawing Date (or the date on which Seller shall have received such notice), if Seller shall have received notice of such drawing after 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Drawing Date (or such other date). In the event the related Seller fails to reimburse the LC Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit as and when required in accordance with the foregoing sentence (including because the conditions precedent to a purchase deemed to have been requested by such Seller pursuant to Section 1.1(d) to reimburse the LC Bank shall not have been satisfied), the LC Bank will promptly notify each LC Participant thereof.

If any LC Participant so notified fails to make available to the LC Bank the amount of such LC Participant's LC Share of such amount by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such LC Participant's obligation to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such LC Participant makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Capital on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The LC Bank will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the LC Bank to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any LC Participant to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such LC Participant from its obligation under this Section 1.9(c), provided that such LC Participant shall not be obligated to pay interest as provided in subclauses (i) and (ii) above until and commencing from the date of receipt of notice from the LC Bank or the Agent of a drawing. Each LC Participant's Commitment to make Participation Advances shall continue until terminated in accordance with Section 4.6 or the last to occur of any of the following events: (A) the LC Bank ceases to be obligated to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (B) no Letter of Credit issued hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled or (C) all Persons (other than a Seller) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit.

Provider warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from such Originator, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Originator, and that it is not relying on any Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future. Provider also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral.

This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Provider.

Section 2. . Provider hereby guarantees to the Recipients the full and punctual payment and performance by each Originator of its Obligations. This Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of all of the Obligations of each Originator under the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by any such Originator pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that any Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by any Originator to such Recipient (including any Purchaser) from any other Person or resort to any collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Recipient (including any Purchaser) in favor of any Originator or any other Person or other means of obtaining payment. Should any Originator default in the payment or performance of any of its Obligations, after giving effect to any applicable grace period, each Recipient (or its respective assigns) may cause the immediate performance by Provider of such Originator's Obligations and cause any payment Obligations of such Originator to become forthwith due and payable to any Recipient (or its respective assigns), without demand or notice of any nature (other than as expressly provided herein), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the collection of any of the Receivables and Provider shall not be responsible for any Obligations to the extent the failure to perform such Obligations by such Originator results from Receivables being uncollectible

Section 4. . Provider waives notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted by any Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any requirement that any Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, other default or omission by any Originator or asserting any other rights of a Recipient under this Undertaking. Provider warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from such Originator, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Originator, and that it is not relying on any Recipient to provide such information, now or in the future. Provider also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral. Each Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Provider and without relieving Provider of any liability under this Undertaking, to deal with such Originator and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Obligations, in such manner as such Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end Provider agrees that the validity and enforceability of this Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of Section 8 hereof, shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Obligations or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination Event, Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Obligations

Section 4
Section 5. . Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of any Originator or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Originator; (b) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Obligations; (c) the failure of any Originator or Provider to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Originator for any other reason other than final payment in full of the payment Obligations in accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be binding on Provider and shall constitute the primary obligation of Provider. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Provider.

counterclaim against any Originator in respect of any liability of Provider to such Originator and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by any Recipient (including any Purchaser). The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of any Originator now or hereafter owed to Provider is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Obligations. Provider agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, Provider will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any Originator to Provider until all of the Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Provider shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Provider as trustee for Recipients (and their respective assigns) and be paid over to Recipients (or their respective assigns) on account of the Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Provider under the other provisions of this Undertaking.

No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.
Termination of Performance Undertaking
Section 10. . This Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of any Originator and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against any Originator under the federal bankruptcy code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the federal bankruptcy code with respect to any Originator or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which any Originator is subject shall postpone the obligations of Provider under this Undertaking.

If Provider is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, any Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no deduction or withholding been made.

Section 13. .

Provider also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as any Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of such Recipient hereunder.
Further Assurances
Section 14. . This Undertaking shall be binding upon Provider, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Recipient and its successors and assigns. Provider may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Recipient. Each Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the Recipients herein.
Successors and Assigns
Section 15. . No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Provider therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each Recipient. No failure on the part of any Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
