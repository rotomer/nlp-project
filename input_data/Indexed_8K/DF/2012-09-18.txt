(e) On September 12, 2012, in connection with the proposed initial public offering (the "IPO") of shares of Class A common stock of The WhiteWave Foods Company ("WhiteWave"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dean Foods Company ("Dean Foods"), the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods (the "DF Compensation Committee") and, subsequently, the independent directors of WhiteWave (the "WhiteWave Independent Directors") approved various compensation matters with respect to the executive officers of WhiteWave, including the compensation matters described below with respect to each of Gregg L. Engles, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods, and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of WhiteWave, and Blaine E. McPeak, President, WhiteWave. As previously reported by Dean Foods, effective upon completion of the IPO, Mr. Engles will resign as the Chief Executive Officer of Dean Foods and will remain Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of WhiteWave, and Mr. McPeak will remain President, WhiteWave and will cease to be an executive officer of Dean Foods.
Approval of Base Salary, Short-Term Incentive Compensation Target Levels and Initial Long-Term Incentive Compensation Target Levels
On September 12, 2012, the DF Compensation Committee and, subsequently, the WhiteWave Independent Directors approved, effective upon completion of the IPO, the base salary, the short-term incentive compensation ("STI") target level (as a percentage of base salary) and the value of the initial long-term incentive compensation ("LTI") target level for each of Messrs. Engles and McPeak, as set forth in the table below:
 
Approval of IPO Grants and Forms of Awards under WhiteWave's 2012 Stock Incentive Plan
In addition, on September 12, 2012, the DF Compensation Committee and, subsequently, the WhiteWave Independent Directors approved the value of the grants of WhiteWave stock options and WhiteWave restricted stock units ("RSUs") to be granted to each of Messrs. Engles and McPeak in connection with the IPO ("IPO Grants"), as set forth in the table below:
 
The DF Compensation Committee and, subsequently, the WhiteWave Independent Directors determined that these IPO Grants will consist of 50% WhiteWave stock options and 50% WhiteWave RSUs to be issued pursuant to WhiteWave's 2012 Stock Incentive Plan and pursuant to forms of award agreements approved by the DF Compensation Committee on September 12, 2012 and, subsequently, by the WhiteWave Independent Directors. Under the forms of award agreement, each IPO Grant will vest pro
rata on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the initial date of grant, and vest in their entirety upon a change in control of WhiteWave or (if prior to a spin-off of WhiteWave common stock by Dean Foods to its stockholders) of Dean Foods. Dean Foods expects (and WhiteWave has informed Dean Foods) that, following any such spin-off, new change in control agreements will be entered into between WhiteWave and certain of its executive officers, including Messrs. Engles and McPeak, that will similarly provide for vesting in their entirety of equity awards, including the IPO Grants, upon a change in control of WhiteWave. The exercise price of the stock options granted pursuant to the IPO Grants will be the initial public offering price of the IPO. The IPO Grants will become effective as of, and are conditioned upon, the determination of the initial public offering price of the IPO. The number of WhiteWave stock options and WhiteWave RSUs issuable to each of Messrs. Engles and McPeak pursuant to the IPO Grants will be determined by reference to the mid-point of the price range to be set forth on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus relating to the IPO.
