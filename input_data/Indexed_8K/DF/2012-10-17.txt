On October 12, 2012, The WhiteWave Foods Company ("WhiteWave"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dean Foods Company ("Dean Foods"), which subsidiary has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 relating to the proposed initial public offering of approximately 12% of WhiteWave's Class A common stock (the "IPO"), entered into a Credit Agreement, with the subsidiary guarantors identified therein, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "WhiteWave Credit Agreement").
The initial credit extensions under the WhiteWave Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions precedent, including (a) completion of the IPO and the related contribution of Dean Foods' WhiteWave-Alpro business to WhiteWave, (b) WhiteWave's consolidated net leverage ratio shall not exceed 3.65 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis and (c) WhiteWave and its subsidiaries shall have been released from their obligations as guarantors of Dean Foods' indebtedness, including the Dean Foods senior credit facility and senior notes.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the WhiteWave Credit Agreement, the lenders have provided WhiteWave the following senior secured credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities") in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.35 billion: (a) a five-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $850 million (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), (b) a five-year term loan A-1 facility in the amount of $250 million (the "Term Loan A-1 Facility") and (c) a seven-year term loan A-2 facility in the amount of $250 million (the "Term Loan A-2 Facility"). Under the WhiteWave Credit Agreement, WhiteWave also has the right to request an increase of the aggregate commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility and to request incremental term loans under the Term Loan A-1 Facility or Term Loan A-2 Facility by up to $500,000,000, subject to specified conditions including the receipt of lender commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility will be available for the issuance of up to $75 million of letters of credit and up to $75 million for swing line loans.
Loans under the Credit Facilities will bear interest, at the election of WhiteWave, at either the base rate (as defined in the WhiteWave Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, plus the applicable interest rate margin for the applicable credit facility. The Term Loan A-1 Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1.75% or the base rate plus 0.75%, and the Term Loan A-2 Facility will initially bear interest at either LIBOR plus 2.00% or the base rate plus 1.00%, and, in each case, will be subject to adjustment based on WhiteWave's consolidated net leverage ratio. The WhiteWave Credit Agreement requires amortization payments in quarterly installments of the following annual percentages of outstanding term loan principal: (a) for the Term Loan A-1 Facility, 5% in year 1, 5% in year 2, 7.5% in year 3, 7.5% in year 4 and 10% in year 5, and (b) for the Term Loan A-2 Facility, 1% per year. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions described in greater detail in the WhiteWave Credit Agreement, WhiteWave will be obligated to prepay the Credit Facilities with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and with casualty and insurance proceeds.
The proceeds of the Credit Facilities will be used: (a) to repay amounts outstanding under intercompany notes owed to Dean Foods upon completion of the IPO, (b) to finance WhiteWave's working capital needs, and (c) for general corporate purposes of WhiteWave and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, including acquisitions.
The Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by WhiteWave's existing and future domestic material restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the WhiteWave Credit Agreement), which will be substantially all of WhiteWave's wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The Credit Facilities will be secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the assets of WhiteWave and the Guarantors, whether consisting of personal, tangible or intangible property, including a pledge of, and a perfected security interest in, (a) all of the shares of capital stock of the Guarantors and (b) 66% of the shares of the capital stock of all first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the WhiteWave Credit Agreement.
The WhiteWave Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, but not limited to specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, guarantee obligations, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, leases, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, investments, loans and advances, transactions with affiliates and sale and leaseback transactions. The WhiteWave Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default and related cure provisions. WhiteWave is required to comply with (a) a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio initially set at 4.25 to 1.00 and stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 beginning with the fifth full fiscal quarter after initial funding and then to 3.75 to 1.00 four fiscal quarters thereafter (subject to WhiteWave's right to increase such ratio by 0.50 to 1.00, but not to exceed 4.50 to 1.00, for the next four fiscal quarters following any permitted acquisition for which the purchase consideration equals or exceeds $50 million) and (b) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio set at 3.00 to 1.00.
The description of the WhiteWave Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the WhiteWave Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for Dean Foods, White Wave and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. In particular, affiliates of certain of the lenders under the WhiteWave Credit Agreement are underwriters in connection with WhiteWave's proposed IPO and/or lenders under Dean Foods' senior credit facility.
 
Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a release of Dean Foods preliminary financial results for its WhiteWave-Alpro segment for the third quarter of 2012, issued October 17, 2012. This release shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise incorporated by reference into any filing pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(e) On September 14, 2012, Dean Foods, as the sole stockholder of WhiteWave, approved The WhiteWave Foods Company 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2012 SIP"). Pursuant to the 2012 SIP, WhiteWave may make awards to its executive officers, non-employee directors, consultants and other WhiteWave employees, including Messrs. Gregg Engles and Blaine McPeak. As set forth in Dean Foods' Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 18, 2012, it is expected that in connection with the IPO Messrs. Engles and McPeak will be granted certain awards of WhiteWave stock options and WhiteWave restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the 2012 SIP. A summary of the material terms of the 2012 SIP is set forth below. The description of the 2012 SIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 SIP, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
General
The purposes of the 2012 SIP are to attract and retain WhiteWave's non-employee directors, consultants, executive personnel, and other key employees of outstanding ability, to motivate them by means of performance-related incentives, and to enable them to participate in WhiteWave's growth and financial success. Eligibility to participate in the 2012 SIP is limited to WhiteWave's employees (including officers and directors who are employees), non-employee directors, and consultants, and employees, non-employee directors, and consultants of WhiteWave's subsidiaries.
Until such time as WhiteWave's board of directors determines to constitute a compensation committee, the 2012 SIP will be administered by WhiteWave's independent directors within the parameters initially established by Dean Foods and the Compensation Committee of the Dean Foods Board of Directors (the "DF Compensation Committee"), except that the DF Compensation Committee and the independent directors of the WhiteWave board will administer the 2012 SIP and determine any grants to be awarded under it prior to the completion of the IPO. Following the constitution of a compensation committee of WhiteWave's board of directors, all references in this section to "WhiteWave's independent directors" shall be deemed to refer to WhiteWave's compensation committee.
WhiteWave's independent directors will, from time to time, determine the specific persons to whom awards under the 2012 SIP will be granted, the extent of any such awards, and the terms and conditions of each award. WhiteWave's independent directors may delegate this authority, in their discretion, to WhiteWave's Chief Executive Officer or other officers, but may only delegate authority with respect to grants to individuals who are not executive officers of WhiteWave and only to the extent that such delegation is permitted under applicable law. WhiteWave's independent directors or their designee, pursuant to the terms of the 2012 SIP, also will make all other necessary decisions and interpretations under the 2012 SIP.
Under the 2012 SIP, WhiteWave's independent directors may grant awards of various types of equity-based compensation, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units, and other types of equity-based awards.
Only WhiteWave Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A common stock"), may be awarded under the 2012 SIP. The maximum number of shares of Class A common stock that will be available to be awarded under the 2012 SIP is 20,000,000 shares. The maximum number of shares of Class A common stock that may be issued under the 2012 SIP with respect to incentive stock options is 1,000,000 shares. In addition, no participant may be granted awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and performance units covering more than 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in any calendar year, and no participant may be granted options and SARs covering more than 2,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in any calendar year. These limits may be modified upon certain corporate events, including recapitalizations, in order to preserve, or prevent the enlargement of, benefits or potential benefits under the 2012 SIP, as may the awards themselves. If, following completion of the IPO, Dean Foods determines to effect a spin-off or other disposition of all or a portion of its ownership interest in WhiteWave, these limits will not apply with respect to awards that may be made under the 2012 SIP in replacement of then outstanding awards in respect of Dean Foods common stock outstanding immediately prior to the distribution or disposition. No more than $10,000,000 may be paid to any one participant with respect to cash-based awards made during a calendar year.
Performance Shares and Performance Units; Performance Awards; Performance Criteria
WhiteWave's independent directors may grant awards of performance shares or performance units under the 2012 SIP based upon the achievement of specified performance objectives or the occurrence of other events, such as a change in control, as determined by the independent directors in their discretion. The independent directors have the authority to determine other terms and conditions of the performance shares and performance units, including conditioning payment on the participant's completing a minimum period of service following the grant date. Participants may not transfer any shares underlying such awards before they vest. WhiteWave's independent directors may also grant performance awards under the 2012 SIP. Performance awards may be payable in cash or in shares of Class A common stock, and may relate to a single-year performance period, such as an annual bonus award, or multi-year periods.
WhiteWave's independent directors may establish performance goals applicable to any award, including performance awards, performance shares, and performance units. When establishing a performance goal, the independent directors will determine the performance period over which performance against the goal will be measured and the amount of cash or number or value of shares of Class A common stock that may be earned based on the level of the performance goal achieved. Additional provisions that relate to the setting of the performance goal, certifying achievement of performance against the goal and the amount earned, and exercising negative discretion to reduce the amount earned and that apply to awards made to executive officers are intended to meet the tax deductibility rules for "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
The 2012 SIP provides that the independent directors may base the performance goals upon the relative or comparative attainment of one or more of the following performance criteria (whether in absolute terms or relative to the performance of one or more similarly situated companies or a published index covering the performance of a number of companies): total shareholder return, stock price, operating earnings or margins, net earnings, earnings per share, EBITDA, net sales, return on equity, income, market share, return on investment, return on capital employed, working capital, return on invested capital, level of expenses, revenue, cash flow, and, in the case of persons who are not executive officers, such other criteria as may be determined by the independent directors. Performance criteria may be established on a company-wide basis or with respect to one or more business units, divisions, or subsidiaries. When establishing performance criteria for a performance period, the independent directors may exclude any or all charges or costs associated with restructurings of WhiteWave or any subsidiary, discontinued operations, other unusual or non-recurring items, the cumulative effects of accounting changes, or such other objective factors as the independent directors deem appropriate.
Unless otherwise determined by the independent directors or provided in an employment or individual severance agreement, if a participant's service is terminated by reason of death, disability, or retirement during the performance period, but at least one year into the performance period, the participant will be entitled to a distribution of the same number of performance awards or performance shares, as well as the value of performance units (without proration) that would have been payable for the performance period had his service continued until the end of the performance period. If a participant's service is terminated for any other reason, performance awards, performance shares, and the value of performance units relating to the relevant performance period will be immediately forfeited and cancelled (unless otherwise determined by the independent directors or provided in an employment or individual severance agreement), and, in any event, all such performance awards, performance shares, and the value of performance units will be immediately forfeited and cancelled upon termination of service for cause.
Restricted Stock and RSUs
The independent directors may grant awards of restricted stock and RSUs under the 2012 SIP. Restricted stock and RSUs are forfeitable until they vest, and the participant may not transfer the restricted stock before it vests. Unless otherwise determined by WhiteWave's independent directors, restricted stock and RSUs will vest ratably over three years on each anniversary of the date of grant (subject to the participant's continued service with WhiteWave) or upon satisfaction of any additional conditions to vesting, such as the achievement of specified performance objectives or changes in control, as determined by the independent directors in their discretion. RSUs may be settled in cash or shares of Class A common stock. Unless otherwise determined by the independent directors or provided in an award, employment or individual severance agreement, if a participant's service is terminated by reason of death, disability, or retirement during the restricted period, a pro rata portion of any restricted stock or RSUs held by the participant will vest and no longer be forfeitable based on the number of full calendar months of the participant's service relative to the number of months in the restricted period at the date of termination. If a participant's service is terminated for any other reason, any restricted stock or RSUs held by the participant will be immediately forfeited and cancelled (unless otherwise determined by the independent directors or provided in an employment or individual severance agreement), and, in any event, all such restricted stock and RSUs will be immediately forfeited and cancelled upon termination of service for cause.
Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
The independent directors may grant awards of stock options and stock appreciation rights under the 2012 SIP. The stock options may be either "incentive stock options" (as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code")), which provide the recipient with favorable tax treatment, or options that are not incentive stock options ("non-qualified stock options"). The independent directors have the authority to determine the terms and conditions of the stock options, including the number of shares subject to each stock option and SAR, the exercise price per share, which must be at least the fair market value of a share of WhiteWave's Class A common stock on the date of grant (as determined in accordance with the 2012 SIP), and when the stock option or SAR will become exercisable. Unless otherwise determined by the independent directors, or provided in an award, employment or individual severance agreement, the stock options and SARs will become vested and exercisable in three approximately equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. Stock options and SARs may also become exercisable upon satisfaction of any additional conditions to vesting, such as the achievement of specified performance objectives or changes in control, as determined by the independent directors in their discretion. The exercise period for any stock options and SARs awarded under the 2012 SIP may not extend beyond ten years from the date of grant.
Stock options and SARs awarded under the 2012 SIP that vest and become exercisable may be exercised in whole or in part. The exercise price of a stock option may be paid either in cash or cash equivalents or, if permitted by the independent directors, with previously acquired shares of Class A common stock, by means of a brokered cashless exercise, or by a combination of the foregoing, provided that the consideration tendered, valued as of the date tendered, is at least equal to the exercise price for the stock options being exercised. Additionally, options may be "net exercised," that is, the excess, if any, of the full fair market value of the shares issuable upon exercise of the options being exercised over the exercise price for such shares and the taxes associated with such exercise will be delivered in shares of Class A common stock without any requirement that the participant pay the exercise price.
Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, are similar to stock options, except that no exercise price is required to be paid. Upon exercise of a SAR, the participant will receive payment equal to the increase in the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price (fair market value on date of grant) times the number of shares of Class A common stock as to which the SAR is being exercised. The payment will be made in cash or shares of Class A common stock of equivalent value.
Unless otherwise determined by the independent directors or provided for in an award, employment, or individual severance agreement, if a participant's service is terminated by reason of death or disability, all stock options and SARs held by the participant at the date of termination will vest and become exercisable and will remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of such termination (or, for incentive stock options, the first anniversary of such termination) or (ii) the expiration date of the option or SAR. If a participant's service is terminated for any other reason, any stock options held by the participant that have not become vested and exercisable will be immediately cancelled and any stock options and SARs that have become vested and exercisable will remain exercisable for 90 days following such termination. In any event, all stock options and SARs (whether or not then vested and exercisable) will be immediately cancelled upon termination of service for cause.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The 2012 SIP permits the independent directors to grant other forms of stock-based awards with such terms and conditions as the independent directors determine, including provisions relating to the impact of termination of service and a change in control. Such awards may include outright grants of shares of Class A common stock without restriction or awards structured to meet the requirements of non-U.S. law or practice. Such awards may be settled by the issuance of shares of Class A common stock or by a cash payment equal to the value of the shares earned under the award.
Change in Control
Except as otherwise provided in an employment or individual severance agreement or award agreement, upon a change in control (as defined in the 2012 SIP) of WhiteWave, or, with respect to the grants made in connection with the IPO and if prior to the intended spin-off of WhiteWave common stock, upon a change in control of Dean Foods, (1) all outstanding stock options and SARs will become immediately vested and exercisable; (2) the restricted period of all outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units will immediately lapse; and (3) each outstanding performance award, performance share, and performance unit will be cancelled in exchange for at least 100% of the amount earned upon full achievement of applicable performance criteria. In addition, the independent directors may provide that in connection with a change in control:
 
 
If a change in control occurs as a result of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of WhiteWave's assets, any participant whose service is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) on or after the date on which WhiteWave's stockholders approve the transaction giving rise to the change in control will be treated for purposes of the 2012 SIP as continuing service with us until the consummation of the change in control and to have been terminated immediately thereafter.
Amendment and Termination
WhiteWave's board of directors may terminate or suspend the 2012 SIP at any time, and from time to time may amend or modify the 2012 SIP, provided that without the approval by a majority of the votes cast at a duly constituted meeting of stockholders, no amendment or modification to the 2012 SIP may (1) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the 2012 SIP, (2) except as a result of an adjustment in capitalization, materially increase the number of shares of stock subject to awards under the 2012 SIP or the number of awards or amount of cash that may be granted to a participant under the 2012 SIP, (3) materially modify the requirements for participation in the 2012 SIP, or (4) materially modify the 2012 SIP in any way that would require stockholder approval under any regulatory requirement that the independent directors, or the compensation committee, if constituted, determines to be applicable. Consequently, the 2012 SIP cannot be amended to remove the prohibition on re-pricing or to permit the grant of options or SARs at below fair market value exercise prices without stockholder approval. No amendment, modification, or termination of the 2012 SIP shall in any material way adversely affect any award previously granted under the 2012 SIP without the consent of the participant. The 2012 SIP shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated by WhiteWave's board of directors, until August 7, 2022, the tenth anniversary of the date on which the 2012 SIP was adopted by WhiteWave's board of directors, at which time no additional awards may be granted after that date.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office.

If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Illegality.
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest rate is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.03    
Inability to Determine Rates.
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) that the LIBOR Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (ii) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base
 
Rate, the utilization of the LIBOR Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice (which revocation the Administrative Agent agrees to give promptly upon receipt of such instruction). Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
(iii) result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans; or
(iv) impose on any Lender or L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Base Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters

of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender's or L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or such Lender's or L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower;
(c) any failure by the Borrower to make a payment of any Loan or any drawing under a Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or
(d) any assignment of a LIBOR Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to ;

deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBOR Rate Loan made by it at the LIBOR Base Rate used in determining the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

(vii) to execute and deliver all assignments, conveyances, statements, financing statements, renewal financing statements, security agreements, affidavits, notices and other agreements, instruments and documents that the Administrative Agent may determine necessary in order to perfect and maintain the security interests and liens granted in this Agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated therein;

(x) to exchange any of the Pledged Equity or other property upon any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the issuer thereof and, in connection therewith, deposit any of the Pledged Equity with any committee, depository, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem appropriate;

This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until such time as the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification, tax gross up, expense reimbursement or yield protection obligations, in each case, for which no claim has been made) arising under the Loan Documents have been paid in full and the Commitments have expired or been terminated. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct, or breach in bad faith of any of its obligations, hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. This power of attorney is conferred on the Administrative Agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable Law.
(b) . The Administrative Agent may from time to time assign the Secured Obligations to a successor Administrative Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and such successor shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement in relation thereto.
Assignment by the Administrative Agent
(c) . Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Obligors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and the Administrative Agent shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the Obligors. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to
The Administrative Agent's Duty of Care
Section 7 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Administrative Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any steps to clean, repair or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.
(d) . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Obligors shall remain liable under each of the Accounts to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise to each such Account. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any holder of Secured Obligations shall have any obligation or liability under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any holder of Secured Obligations of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor shall the Administrative Agent or any holder of Secured Obligations be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of an Obligor under or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.
Liability with Respect to Accounts
(e) .
Voting and Payment Rights in Respect of the Pledged Equity
(i) So long as no Event of Default shall exist, each Obligor may (A) exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Equity of such Obligor or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement and (B) receive and retain any and all dividends (subject to any requirement that Collateral be delivered to the Administrative Agent hereunder), principal or interest paid in respect of the Pledged Equity to the extent they are allowed under the Credit Agreement; and
(ii) During the continuance of an Event of Default, (A) all rights of an Obligor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to clause (i)(A) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights, (B) all rights of an Obligor to receive the dividends, principal and interest payments which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to clause (i)(B) above shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon be vested in the Administrative Agent which shall then have the sole right to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends, principal and interest payments, and (C) all dividends, principal and interest payments which are received by an Obligor contrary to the provisions of clause (ii)(B) above shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Obligor, and shall be forthwith paid over to the Administrative Agent as Collateral in the exact form received, to be held by the Administrative Agent as Collateral and as further collateral security for the Secured Obligations.
(f) . (i) If any Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Obligor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Obligor, shall promptly execute and deliver to such Obligor all releases and other documents, and take such other action, reasonably
Releases of Collateral
necessary for the release of the Liens created hereby or by any other Collateral Document on such Collateral. (ii) The Administrative Agent may release any of the Pledged Equity from this Agreement or may substitute any of the Pledged Equity for other Pledged Equity without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Agreement as to any Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted, and this Agreement shall continue as a first priority lien on all Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted. (iii) Upon the sale, conveyance or contribution thereof to a Receivables Financing SPC in connection with a Permitted Receivables Financing, the Accounts and related Transferred Assets shall be automatically released from the security interests created pursuant to this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent shall, at the expense of the Obligors, execute such documentation reasonably necessary to evidence such release).
9. . Upon the acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to of the Credit Agreement, any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Secured Obligations in Money, will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in of the Credit Agreement.

At such time this Agreement shall be automatically terminated and the Administrative Agent shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Obligors, forthwith release all of its liens and security interests hereunder and shall execute and deliver all UCC termination statements and/or other documents reasonably requested by the Obligors evidencing such termination.
(b) This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Secured Obligations as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any Debtor Relief Law, all as though such payment had not been made; provided that in the event payment of all or any part of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned, all reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation any reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Secured Obligations in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to be included as a part of the Secured Obligations.

2. On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as practicable thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender as the case may be, a statement setting forth the calculation of any Mandatory Cost.
Additional Cost Rate
3. The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent.

6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages ( 5% will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).

i.e.
7. If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Lender with a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the rate of charge payable by such Lender to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Lender for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Lender.
8. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
 
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
9. The percentages or rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of A, C and E above shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to and above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the Fees Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as such Lender's Lending Office.
paragraphs 7

10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over- or under-compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender pursuant to , and above is true and correct in all respects.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(f), Section 9 of the Plan shall determine the treatment of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units upon a Change in Control, including the treatment of such Awards granted to any Participant whose Service is involuntarily terminated by an Employer other than for Cause or whose Service is terminated due to a Special Termination, in either case, on or after the date on which the shareholders of the Company approve the transaction giving rise to the Change in Control, but prior to the consummation thereof.
Section 7. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
(a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights ("") may be granted to Participants at such time or times as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock Options, Non-statutory Stock Options and SARs. The grant date of an Option or SAR under the Plan will be the date on which the Option or SAR is awarded by the Committee, or such other future date as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. Each Option or SAR shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the type of Option Award granted, the exercise price, the duration of the Option or SAR, the number of shares of Stock to which the Option or SAR pertains, the conditions upon which the Option or SAR or any portion thereof shall become vested or exercisable and such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall determine, including customary representations, warranties and covenants with respect to securities law matters. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees.
Grant.
SARs
(b) The Committee shall establish the exercise price at the time each Option or SAR is granted, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Incentive Stock Option is granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Affiliate thereof, the exercise price shall be at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the grant date.
Exercise Price.
 
(c) Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at or after the grant date, and subject to the Participant's continued employment with his or her Employer on such date, each Option and SAR awarded to a Participant under the Plan shall become vested and exercisable in three approximately equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Options and SARs may also become exercisable, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of any event or events, including a Change in Control, specified in the Plan, or specified by the Committee, in its discretion, either at or after the grant date of the applicable Option or SAR. In its discretion, the Committee may also establish performance conditions with respect to the exercisability of any Option or SAR during a Performance Period selected by the Committee. No Option or SAR shall be exercisable on or after the tenth anniversary of its grant date (the fifth anniversary of the grant date for an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Affiliate thereof). The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options or SARs, including without limitation, any relating to the application of federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or advisable.
Vesting and Exercisability.
(d) No Stock shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the exercise price therefore is received by the Company. Such payment may be made in cash or its equivalent or, if permitted by the Committee, () by exchanging shares of Stock owned by the Participant for at least six months (or for such greater or lesser period as the Committee may determine from time to time) and which are not the subject of any pledge or other security interest, () through an arrangement with a broker approved by the Company whereby payment of the exercise price is accomplished with the proceeds of the sale of Stock or () by a combination of the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Stock so tendered to the Company, valued as of the date of such tender, is at least equal to such exercise price of the portion of the Option being exercised. Additionally, to the extent authorized by the Committee (whether at or after the grant date), Options may be Net Exercised subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may from time to time impose. The Company may not make a loan to a Participant to facilitate such Participant's exercise of any of his or her Options or payment of taxes.

(iii) Termination for Cause.

(iv) Termination in Connection with a Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7(g), Section 9 of the Plan shall determine the treatment of Options and SARs upon a Change in Control, including the treatment of Options and SARs granted to any Participant
 
whose Service is involuntarily terminated by an Employer other than for Cause or whose Service is terminated due to a Special Termination, in either case, on or after the date on which the shareholders of the Company approve the transaction giving rise to the Change in Control, but prior to the consummation thereof.

Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the terms and conditions applicable thereto. Any Other Stock-Based Award may entail the transfer of actual shares of Stock or the payment of the value of such Award in cash based upon the value of a specified number of shares of Stock, or any combination of the foregoing, as determined by the Committee. The terms of any Other Stock-Based Award need not be uniform in application to all (or any class of) Participants, and each Other Stock-Based Award granted to any Participant (whether or not at the same time) may have different terms.
Other Stock-Based Awards.
(b) In addition to any other terms and conditions that may be specified by the Committee, each Other Stock-Based Award shall specify the impact of a termination of Service upon the rights of a Participant in respect of such Award.

(b) In the event that any Change in Control occurs as a result of any transaction described in clause (iii) or (iv) of the definition of such term, any Participant whose Service is involuntarily terminated by an Employer other than for Cause or is terminated due to a Special Termination, in either case, on or after the date on which the shareholders of the Company approve the transaction giving rise to the Change in Control, but prior to the consummation thereof, shall be treated, solely for purposes of this Plan (including, without limitation, this Section 9), as continuing in Service until the occurrence of such Change in Control and to have been terminated immediately thereafter.
Termination of Service Prior to Change in Control.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, to the extent that any Award granted under the Plan and outstanding at the time of Change in Control is treated as "deferred compensation" under Section 409A, and not exempt from its requirements under any applicable exemption therefrom, no acceleration of payment of such Award shall be made upon a Change in Control unless such event is also a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation within the meaning of Section 409A. Any Award which is not payable upon the occurrence of a Change in Control solely by operation of this Section 9(c) shall become vested in accordance with Section 9(a)(i), but shall be paid at the date or event that such Award would have been payable without regard to the occurrence of such Change in Control.
Amounts Subject to Section 409A.
Section 10. Effective Date, Amendment, Modification and Termination of the Plan or Awards
(a) The Plan shall be effective on the Effective Date, and shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated pursuant to this Section 10, until the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, after which no new Awards may be granted under the Plan. The Board may at any time in its sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, terminate or suspend the Plan, and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan; provided that without the approval by a majority of the votes cast at a duly constituted meeting of shareholders of the Company, no amendment or modification to the Plan may () materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, () except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4(d) of the Plan, materially increase the number of shares of Stock subject to the Plan or the individual Award limitations specified in Section 4(c) of the Plan, () materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan or () materially modify the Plan in any other way that would require shareholder approval under any regulatory requirement that the Board or the Committee determines to be applicable. In the event that the Committee shall determine that such action would, taking into account such factors as it deems relevant, be beneficial to the Company, the Committee may affirmatively act to amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award at any time prior to payment or exercise in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, subject to Section 10(b), including without limitation, to change the date or dates as of which () an Option becomes exercisable, () a Performance Award, Performance Share or Performance Unit is deemed earned, or () Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units becomes nonforfeitable, except that no outstanding Option or SAR may be amended or otherwise modified or exchanged (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 4(d) of the Plan) in a manner that would have the effect of reducing its original exercise price or otherwise constitute repricing. Any such action by the Committee shall be subject to the Participant's consent if the Committee determines that such action would adversely affect in any material way the Participant's rights under such Award, whether in whole or it part. No amendment, modification or termination of the Plan or any Award shall adversely affect in any material way any Award theretofore granted under the Plan, without the consent of the Participant.

Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Events.
(i) Equity Restructurings. If the outstanding shares of Stock are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities of the Company through a non-reciprocal transaction between the Company and its stockholders that causes the per share fair market value underlying an Award to change, such as stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering, recapitalization through a large, non-recurring cash dividend, or other similar transaction, a proportionate adjustment shall be made to the number or kind of shares or securities allocated to Awards that have been granted prior to any such change. Any such adjustment in an outstanding Option or SAR shall be made without change in the aggregate exercise price applicable to the unexercised portion of such Option or SAR but with a corresponding adjustment in the exercise price for each share of Stock or other unit of any security covered by such Option or SAR.
(ii) Reciprocal Transactions. The Board may, but shall not be obligated to, make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment to an Award or to the exercise price of any outstanding Award, and/or grant an additional Award to the holder of any outstanding Award, to compensate for the diminution in the intrinsic value of the shares of Stock resulting from any reciprocal transaction.
(iii) Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events. In recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements, or in recognition of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, and, whenever the Board determines that adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, the Board may, using reasonable care, make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards. In case of an Award designed to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception (as defined in Code Section 409A), the Board will take care not to make an adjustment that would disqualify the Award.
(iv) Fractional Shares and Notice. Fractional shares of Stock resulting from any adjustment in Awards pursuant to this Section 10(b) may be settled in cash or otherwise as the Board determines. The Company will give notice of any adjustment to each Participant who holds an Award that has been adjusted and the adjustment (whether or not such notice is given) will be effective and binding for all Plan purposes.
 
Section 11. Deferrals and Section 409A
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no terms of this Plan relating to Awards or any deferral with respect thereto shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to cause an Award, or the deferral or payment thereof, to become subject to interests and additional tax under Section 409A.; provided, however, that no Participant shall have the right to assert any claim against the Company for any tax or other liability incurred by reason of any Award granted hereunder failing to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A.
(b) With respect to any Participant who is employed in the United States or is otherwise treated as subject to income taxation in the United States in respect of an Award payable under the Plan (a ""), () such Participant shall not be treated as having incurred a termination of Service for purposes of this Plan, including a Retirement from Service, unless and until such Participant shall have incurred a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder and () any payment due such Participant in connection with any such separation from service which is treated as deferred compensation subject to Section 409A shall not be made earlier than the date which is six months and one day after such separation from service, if such Participant is a "specified employee" of the Company, as determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 409A and the regulations thereunder (taking into account any policies or practices of the Company established in accordance with such regulations).

Section 12. General Provisions
(a) The Employer shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant in cash (whether under this Plan or otherwise) any amount required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under this Plan as may be necessary in the opinion of the Employer to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements under the laws of any country, state, province, city or other jurisdiction, including but not limited to income taxes, capital gains taxes, transfer taxes, and social security contributions that are required by law to be withheld. In the case of payments of Awards in the form of Stock, at the Committee's discretion, the Participant shall be required to either pay to the Employer the amount of any taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Stock or, in lieu thereof, the Employer shall have the right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the opportunity to elect to tender) the number of shares of Stock whose Fair Market Value equals such amount required to be withheld.
Withholding.
(b) No Award shall be assignable or transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided that the Committee may permit (on such terms and conditions as it shall establish) a Participant to transfer an Award for no consideration to the Participant's child, stepchild, grandchild,
Nontransferability of Awards.

Except to the extent required by law, no right or interest of any Participant shall be subject to any lien, obligation or liability of the Participant. All rights with respect to Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by such Participant or, if applicable, his or her Permitted Transferee(s). The rights of a Permitted Transferee shall be limited to the rights conveyed to such Permitted Transferee, who shall be subject to and bound by the terms of the agreement or agreements between the Participant and the Company.
Permitted Transferees
(c) Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company to establish other plans or to pay compensation, in cash or property, in a manner that is not expressly authorized under the Plan.
No Limitation on Compensation.
(d) No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and the grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer. The grant of an Award hereunder, and any future grant of Awards under the Plan is entirely voluntary, and at the complete discretion of the Company. Neither the grant of an Award nor any future grant of Awards by the Company shall be deemed to create any obligation to grant any further Awards, whether or not such a reservation is explicitly stated at the time of such a grant.
No Right to Employment.
The Plan shall not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be construed by the Participant to constitute, part of the terms and conditions of employment and participation in the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute, and shall not be deemed by the Participant to constitute, an employment or labor relationship of any kind with an Employer. Each Employer expressly reserves the right at any time to dismiss a Participant free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, except as provided herein and in any agreement entered into with respect to an Award. The Company expressly reserves the right to require, as a condition of participation in the Plan, that Award recipients agree and acknowledge the above in writing. Further, the Company expressly reserves the right to require Award recipients, as a condition of participation, to consent in writing to the collection, transfer from the Employer to the Company and third parties, storage and use of personal data for purposes of administering the Plan.
(e) Subject to the provisions of the applicable Award contained in the Plan and in the Award Agreement, no Participant, Permitted Transferee or Designated Beneficiary shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Stock to be distributed under the Plan until he or she has become the holder thereof.
No Rights as Shareholder.
 
(f) The validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations, and rights relating to the Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to the principles of conflicts of law).
Construction of the Plan.
(g) The Plan, the granting and exercising of Awards thereunder, and any obligations of the Company under the Plan, shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and foreign country laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required, and to any rules or regulations of any exchange on which the Stock is listed. The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the granting and exercising of Awards, the issuance or delivery of Stock under any Award or any other action permitted under the Plan to permit the Company, with reasonable diligence, to complete such stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of such Stock or other required action under any federal, state or foreign country law, rule or regulation and may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Stock in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Company shall not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to recognize the exercise of any Award or to otherwise sell or issue Stock in violation of any such laws, rules or regulations, and any postponement of the exercise or settlement of any Award under this provision shall not extend the term of such Awards. Neither the Company nor its directors or officers shall have any obligation or liability to a Participant with respect to any Award (or Stock issuable thereunder) that shall lapse because of such postponement.
Compliance with Legal and Exchange Requirements.
(h) Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee and each delegate of such Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be made a party or in which he or she may be involved in by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against him or her, provided that the Company is given an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it personally. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive and shall be independent of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise.
Indemnification.
(i) Except as may otherwise be specifically stated under any employee benefit plan, policy or program, no amount payable in respect of any Award shall be treated as compensation for purposes of calculating a Participant's right under any such plan, policy or program.
No Impact on Benefits.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
