Discover will decide on the form of payment and may pay dividend equivalents in shares of Discover common stock, in cash or in a combination thereof.

Shares withheld or tendered will be valued using the fair market value of Discover common stock on the later of (i) the date your restricted stock units convert or (ii) the date the shares of Discover common stock are delivered, using a valuation methodology established by Discover.

(a)
Discover may withhold the payment of dividend equivalents on your restricted stock units to ensure satisfaction of any obligation that you owe the Company or any tax or other withholding obligations.
(b)

9. .
Nontransferability

This prohibition includes any assignment or other transfer that purports to occur by operation of law or otherwise. During your lifetime, payments relating to the restricted stock units will be made only to you.

[ Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Award Certificate, the conversion of your vested restricted stock units into Discover common stock will be deferred if, at the time scheduled for conversion (whether on the Scheduled Vesting Date or some other time), Discover reasonably considers you to be a participant whose compensation may be subject to the limit on deductible compensation imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. This deferral will continue until such time during the first taxable year in which the Company reasonably anticipates that if payment is made at such time during such year, the deduction of such payment will not be barred by the application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and your vested restricted stock units will convert into Discover common stock as soon as administratively practicable thereafter; , , that in the event that your death occurs at any time after the Date of the Award, payment will be made in accordance with Section 5(b).]*
