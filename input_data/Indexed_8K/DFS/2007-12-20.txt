Riverwoods, IL, Dec. 20, 2007
For the full year, the company reported net income of $561 million, or $1.17 per share, including the impairment charge.  Without the charge, net income would have been $840 million, or $1.75 per share.
Fourth Quarter Highlights
While we are disappointed with the impairment charge in our UK business, Discovers overall fourth quarter profit before tax, excluding this charge, increased by 63% over last year, said David Nelms, chief executive officer of Discover Financial Services.  Our U.S. Card business achieved solid growth in sales volume and receivables, strong credit results and improved revenues and operating efficiencies.  In our Third-Party Payments segment, our network volume reached almost $25 billion in the quarter, an increase of 28%.  For the International Card segment, our loss before impairment was substantially reduced despite an elevated cost of funds and high credit losses.

Segment Results (Managed Basis):
U.S. Card
Pretax income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $328 million, up 43% from the fourth quarter of 2006, driven by higher net interest income and other income and by lower expenses, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses.
Managed loans grew for the seventh consecutive quarter to $48.2 billion, up 5% from last year, and strong sales volume continued, increasing 6%.  Credit quality remained strong, but delinquency rates increased from last quarter.  The managed credit card net charge-off rate of 3.84% was up 14 basis points from the third quarter of 2007, but was 15 basis points lower than last year.  The managed credit card 30+ days delinquency rate was 3.59%, up 43 basis points from the third quarter of 2007 and 20 basis points from last year.
Full year pretax income of $1.5 billion was down $136 million from 2006, driven by an increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net interest income.

Full year credit card sales volume was a record $90.3 billion, up 4% over last year. The full year managed credit card net charge-off rate of 3.84% was 12 basis points lower than 2006.
Third-Party Payments
Fourth quarter pretax income of $8 million was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2006 due to higher revenue related to increased volumes, partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives.  Third-Party Payment debit and credit volume was $24.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007, up 28% over last year, reflecting the impact of new financial institution signings as well as increased volumes from existing financial institutions.
Full year pretax income of $37 million was up 28% from 2006, driven by higher revenue from increased volumes that was partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives and from higher third-party card issuer fees.  Third-Party Payment debit and credit volume was $91.7 billion for 2007, up 25% from 2006.
International Card
The pretax loss of $423 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 included the non-cash impairment charge of $391 million.  Excluding this charge, the pretax loss of $32 million compared favorably to the pretax loss of $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2006 due to lower provision for loan losses and expenses and higher other income partially offset by lower net interest income.

Managed loans decreased 6% from last year, reflecting increased payments and reduced emphasis on loan growth, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange rate. The fourth quarter managed net charge-off rate of 6.65% was up 9 basis points from the third quarter of 2007 and 85 basis points from last year.  Managed net charge-off dollars have stabilized, but the rate was up due to the effect of declining receivable balances.  The managed 30+ days delinquency rate of 5.25% was up 36 basis points from the third quarter of 2007 and 67 basis points from last year.
The full year 2007 pretax loss of $596 million compared unfavorably to the loss of $87 million for 2006, largely driven by the $391 million non-cash impairment charge as well as higher provision for loan losses and expenses.
Full year credit card sales volume was $13.0 billion, up 25% over last year reflecting a full year of sales related to the Goldfish acquisition.  The full year managed net charge-off rate of 6.54% was up 109 basis points from 2006.
