The following pages present a reconciliation for certain information disclosed in the financial data supplement.
 
 
The data is presented on both a "managed" loan basis and as reported under generally accepted accounting principles ("owned" loan basis). Managed
loan data assume that the company's securitized loan receivables have not been sold and presents the results of securitized loan receivables in the same
manner as the company's owned loans. The company operates its business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis. Accordingly,
underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans. The company believes that managed loan information is
useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and
allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations. Managed loan data is also
relevant because the company services the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the
loans. In addition, investors often request information on a managed basis which provides a more meaningful comparison to industry competitors.
