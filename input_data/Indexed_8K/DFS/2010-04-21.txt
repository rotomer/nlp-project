Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On April 21, 2010, Discover Financial Services (the "Company") completed the repurchase of the 1,224,558 shares of the Company's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the "Preferred Stock") issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program of the Troubled Asset Relief Program on March 13, 2009. The Company repurchased the Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,235,783,115, consisting of (i) $1,224,558,000 in principal and (ii) $11,225,115 in accrued dividends.
The Preferred Stock was issued at a discount to reflect the value of the warrant to purchase common stock of the Company issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the initial sale of the Preferred Stock. As a result of the repurchase of the Preferred Stock, the Company will accelerate the accretion of that discount. While the acceleration of the discount will not impact net income, it will reduce the net income available to common stockholders by approximately $63 million and, combined with the payment of the accrued dividends on the Preferred Stock of $11,225,115, will reduce the Company's second quarter earnings per share by $0.13.
In connection with the repurchase of the Preferred Stock, the Company plans to notify the U.S. Treasury of its intent to repurchase the warrant if the Company can agree upon a price with the U.S. Treasury. If a price cannot be agreed upon, the U.S. Treasury may choose to proceed to sell the warrant through an auction process, in which the Company may or may not participate.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
