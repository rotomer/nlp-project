(d) At Discover Financial Services' 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a majority of the votes cast by shareholders, on an advisory basis, were in favor of an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation. In line with this vote and after considering the matter, our Board of Directors has decided that it will include an advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation in our proxy materials every year until the next advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, which will occur no later than our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2017.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
