The Senior Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Indenture) applicable to the debt securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series by notice in writing to the Issuer and to the Trustee, if given by the securityholders, may then declare the principal of all debt securities of such series and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, but upon certain conditions such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived (except a continuing default in payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on such debt securities) by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding.
 
The provisions in Article X of the Senior Indenture relating to discharge and defeasance shall be applicable to the Notes.
The Senior Indenture permits the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series issued under the Senior Indenture then outstanding and affected, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner the rights of the Holders of such series so affected; that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby, (a) extend the final maturity of any such Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption or repayment thereof, or change the currency of payment thereof, or modify or amend the provisions for conversion of any currency into any other currency, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of Securities the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture.
provided
Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not be entitled to have the Notes represented by such Global Note registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the Senior Indenture.
If (i) The Depository Trust Company (""), as depositary for the Notes, notifies the Issuer that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary or DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of such notice or cessation, (ii) the Issuer in its sole discretion determines that the Global Notes (on whole but not in part) should be exchanged for individual Notes and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee or (iii) an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f) of the Senior Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Notes, then, upon surrender by DTC of the Global Note, Notes in certificated form will be issued to each person that DTC identifies as the beneficial owner of the Notes represented by the Global Note. Upon any such issuance, the Trustee is required to register such certificated Notes in the name of such person or persons (or the nominee of any thereof) and cause the same to be delivered thereto.
DTC
Principal of, premium (if any) and interest on this Note will be payable, and this Note may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Trustee). Payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on Notes in global form will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee as the registered Holder of such global notes. If this Note is no longer represented by a global Note, payment of interest on the Notes in certificated form may, at the Issuer's option, be made by check mailed directly to Holders at their registered addresses.
So long as the Notes are represented by one or more global Notes, transfers of beneficial interests in such global Notes will be effected under DTC's procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. If the Notes are no longer represented by global Notes, a Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in certificated form at the same location given in the preceding paragraph. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
The Issuer will not be required to (a) register the transfer of or exchange any Note if the Holder has exercised the Holder's right, if any, to require the Issuer to repurchase the Note, in whole or in part, except the portion of the Note not required to be repurchased, (b) register the transfer of or exchange Notes to be redeemed for a period of fifteen calendar days preceding the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption; or (c) register the transfer of or exchange any registered Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed or unpaid portion of that registered Note being redeemed in part.
No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the registration of transfer or exchange of Notes.
With respect to moneys paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent for payment of the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on any Notes that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or premium shall have become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise), (i) the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall notify the Holders of such Notes that such moneys shall be repaid to the Issuer and any person claiming such moneys shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof and (ii) such moneys shall be so repaid to the Issuer. Upon such repayment all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease, without, however, limiting in any way any obligation that the Issuer may have to pay the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on this Note as the same shall become due.
No provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the registered Holder of this Note.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on this Note, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, except as may be required by mandatory provisions of law.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Senior Indenture and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Indenture.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription on the face of this instrument, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:
 
 
 
        Additional abbreviations may also be used though not in the above list.
