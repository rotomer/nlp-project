Second Quarter Highlights
 
"Our results this quarter reflect outstanding fundamental performance in both of our business segments and continued improvement in credit performance," said David Nelms, chairman and chief executive officer of Discover. "In addition to the strong financial results for the quarter, I am excited about our recent expansion into three new products.  Discover now offers mortgages through the recently acquired Home Loan Center platform, a fixed rate private student loan product to better meet the tuition funding needs of our customers and our first major affinity credit card.  We believe these new products lay a foundation for additional revenue and asset growth in the future."
Segment Results:
Direct Banking
Direct Banking pretax income of $820 million in the quarter was down $63 million, or 7%, from the prior year.
Discover card sales volume grew 5% from the prior year to $26.1 billion.  Credit card loans ended the quarter at $46.6 billion, up 4%, or $1.6 billion, from the prior year.
Total loans ended the quarter at $57.1 billion, up $4.5 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior year.  Private student loans increased $2.9 billion, including the acquisition of a $2.4 billion student loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Personal loans increased $703 million from the prior year.
Net interest margin was 9.31%, up 16 basis points from the prior year and 28 basis points from the prior quarter.  The increase in net interest margin from the prior year reflects decreased funding costs partially offset by lower credit card yield.  Credit card yield was 12.35%, a decrease of 22 basis points from the prior year and an increase of 14 basis points from the prior quarter.  The decline in credit card yield from the prior year reflects a decline in higher rate balances and an increase in promotional rate balances, partially offset by lower interest charge-offs.  Interest expense as a percent of total loans decreased 50 basis points from the prior year and 5 basis points from the prior quarter as the company continued to take advantage of available low rate funding.

Net interest income increased $122 million, or 10%, from the prior year, benefiting from loan growth and lower interest expense. This was partially offset by a decline in credit card and student loan yields.
The delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due was 1.91%, an improvement of 88 basis points from the prior year, and 31 basis points from the prior quarter.  The credit card net charge-off rate decreased to 2.79% for the second quarter of 2012, down 222 basis points from the prior year and 28 basis points from the prior quarter.
Charge-offs were down $235 million from the prior year as a result of the continued decline in delinquencies. Provision for loan losses of $232 million increased $56 million, or 32%, from the prior year, driven by a lower reserve release partially offset by the decline in charge-offs.  The reserve release for the second quarter of 2012 was $110 million reflecting the impact of a 23 basis point decline in the reserve rate from the prior quarter partially offset by additional reserves due to loan growth.   The second quarter of 2011 included a reserve release of $401 million.
Other income decreased $21 million, or 4%, from the prior year due to lower late fee assessments, lower transition services revenue related to the Student Loan Corporation and a decline in protection products revenue.  The second quarter of 2011 included an increase in the value of loans held for sale.
 
Expenses were up $108 million, or 18%, from the prior year. The increase is primarily due to a $71 million year-over-year increase in legal reserve expense, as the company added $90 million to the legal reserves in the quarter.  Excluding the change in legal reserve expense, expenses increased 6% essentially in line with revenue and receivable growth.
Payment Services
Payment Services pretax income was $47 million in the quarter, up $4 million, or 10%, from the prior year.  Revenue increased $10 million, primarily driven by an increase in higher margin point-of-sale transactions on the PULSE network and increased third-party issuer volume partially offset by higher incentives.  Expenses were up $6 million from the prior year.
Payment Services dollar volume was $51.4 billion for the second quarter of 2012, up 12% from the prior year, driven by higher PULSE and third-party issuer volume.
Share Repurchases
In the second quarter of 2012, the company repurchased 13.5 million shares of common stock for $447 million. Shares outstanding declined by 2.4% from prior quarter.
