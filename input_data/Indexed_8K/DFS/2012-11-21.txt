If this Note is no longer represented by a global Note, payment of interest on the Notes in certificated form may, at the Issuer's option, be made by check mailed directly to Holders at their registered addresses.
So long as the Notes are represented by one or more global Notes, transfers of beneficial interests in such global Notes will be effected under DTC's procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. If the Notes are no longer represented by global Notes, a Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in certificated form at the same location given in the preceding paragraph.

With respect to moneys paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent for payment of the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on any Notes that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or premium shall have become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise), (i) the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall notify the Holders of such Notes that such moneys shall be repaid to the Issuer and any person claiming such moneys shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof and (ii) such moneys shall be so repaid to the Issuer. Upon such repayment all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease, without, however, limiting in any way any obligation that the Issuer may have to pay the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on this Note as the same shall become due.
No provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the registered Holder of this Note.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

However, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply (a) to any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former connection between the Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the Holder, if the Holder is an estate, a trust, a partnership, a limited liability company or a corporation) and the United States and its possessions, including, without limitation, the Holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present in the United States or having, or having had, a permanent establishment in the United States, or (ii) the presentation by the Holder of any Note, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; (b) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge; (c) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the Holder's past or present status as a controlled foreign corporation or passive foreign investment company with respect to the United States or as a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or as a private foundation or other tax-exempt organization; (d) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed other than by withholding or deduction from payments on or in respect of any Note; (e) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with certification, information or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or beneficial owner of that Note, if compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the United States or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a precondition to relief or exemption from the tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (f) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by reason of the Holder's past or present status as the actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the Issuer or as a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer; (g) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made pursuant to any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any European Union Directive on the taxation of savings; (h) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of the principal of, or interest on any Note, if such tax, assessment or other governmental charge results from the presentation of any Note for payment and the payment can be made without such withholding or deduction by the presentation of this Note for payment by at least one other paying agent; (i) any withholding or deduction that is imposed or required to be made under Sections 1471 or 1472 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; or (j) in the case of any combination of the forgoing items.
Additional Amounts will also not be paid with respect to any payment on a Note to a Holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company, or other than the sole beneficial owner of that payment to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to that fiduciary, a member of that partnership, an interest Holder of that limited liability company, or a beneficial owner who, in each case, would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder.

If (i) The Depository Trust Company (""), as depositary for the Notes, notifies the Issuer that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary or DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of such notice or cessation, (ii) the Issuer in its sole discretion determines that the Global Notes (on whole but not in part) should be exchanged for individual Notes and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee or (iii) an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f) of the Senior Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Notes, then, upon surrender by DTC of the Global Note, Notes in certificated form will be issued to each person that DTC identifies as the beneficial owner of the Notes represented by the Global Note. Upon any such issuance, the Trustee is required to register such certificated Notes in the name of such person or persons (or the nominee of any thereof) and cause the same to be delivered thereto.
DTC
Principal of, premium (if any) and interest on this Note will be payable, and this Note may be exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Trustee). Payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on Notes in global form will be made in immediately available funds to DTC's nominee as the registered Holder of such global notes. If this Note is no longer represented by a global Note, payment of interest on the Notes in certificated form may, at the Issuer's option, be made by check mailed directly to Holders at their registered addresses.
So long as the Notes are represented by one or more global Notes, transfers of beneficial interests in such global Notes will be effected under DTC's procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. If the Notes are no longer represented by global Notes, a Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in certificated form at the same location given in the preceding paragraph. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
The Issuer will not be required to (a) register the transfer of or exchange any Note if the Holder has exercised the Holder's right, if any, to require the Issuer to repurchase the Note, in whole or in part, except the portion of the Note not required to be repurchased, (b) register the transfer of or exchange Notes to be redeemed for a period of fifteen calendar days preceding the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption; or (c) register the transfer of or exchange any registered Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed or unpaid portion of that registered Note being redeemed in part.
No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the registration of transfer or exchange of Notes.
With respect to moneys paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent for payment of the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on any Notes that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or premium shall have become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise), (i) the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall notify the Holders of such Notes that such moneys shall be repaid to the Issuer and any person claiming such moneys shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof and (ii) such moneys shall be so repaid to the Issuer. Upon such repayment all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease, without, however, limiting in any way any obligation that the Issuer may have to pay the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on this Note as the same shall become due.
No provision of this Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the registered Holder of this Note.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Dear Sirs:
Discover Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to exchange up to $500,000,000 in the aggregate of the issued and outstanding 8.70% Subordinated Notes Due 2019 issued by Discover Bank, a subsidiary of the Company (the "Existing Securities"), upon the terms set forth in a dealer manager agreement of even date herewith (the "Dealer Manager Agreement"), for up to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's Senior Notes Due 2022 (the "Initial Securities"). The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of July 12, 2007 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and an officers' certificate, dated November 21, 2012, setting forth the terms of the Initial Securities (the "Officers' Certificate"). As an inducement to the holders of the Existing Securities to exchange the Existing Securities and in satisfaction of a condition to the obligations of the Company under the exchange offer, the Company agrees with Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (collectively, the "Dealer Managers"), for the benefit of the holders of the Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities (as defined below) (collectively the "Holders"), as follows:
1. . The Company shall, at its own cost, prepare and, not later than 120 days after (or if the 120th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) the last date of original issue of the Initial Securities (the "Issue Date"), file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to a proposed offer (the "Registered Exchange Offer") to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof), who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities (the "Exchange Securities") of the Company issued under the Indenture and the Officers' Certificate and identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Initial Securities and the provisions relating to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) that would be registered under the Securities Act. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act within 180 days (or if the 180th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities (unless the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case within 240 days after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities), (ii) keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective until the closing of the Registered Exchange Offer (or longer, if required by applicable law) (such period being called the "Exchange Offer Registration Period"), and (iii) cause the Registered Exchange Offer to be consummated not later than 60 days following the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement.
Registered Exchange Offer
Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States.
The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, (i) each Holder which is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "Exchanging Dealer"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Exchange Offer Procedures" section and the "Purpose of the Exchange Offer" section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; , , that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer, such period shall be the lesser of 180 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 180 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer.
provided
however
The Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the "Securities."
In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(a) mail to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b) keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders;
(c) utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
(d) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
 
(e) otherwise comply with all applicable laws.
As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(x) accept for exchange all the Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer;
(y) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(z) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
The Officers' Certificate will provide that the Exchange Securities will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that all the Securities will vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a class separate from one another on any matter.
Interest on each Exchange Security issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Initial Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Initial Securities, from the date of original issue of the Initial Securities.
Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such Holder will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
2. . If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 60 days
Shelf Registration
 
following the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or (iii) any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange, the Company shall take the following actions:
(a) The Company shall, at its cost, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 60 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 2, or, if later, 120 days after the Issue Date) file with the Commission and thereafter shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) a registration statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "Registration Statement") not later than 120 days after filing pursuant to this Section 2 (unless the Shelf Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case not later than 180 days after filing pursuant to this Section 2), or, if later, 180 days after the Issue Date (unless the Shelf Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case not later than 240 days after the Issue Date), on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "Shelf Registration"); , , that no Holder shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder.
provided
however
(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of one year (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective or becomes automatically effective upon filing or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant thereto or (ii) are no longer Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof). The Company shall be deemed not to have used commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities during that period, unless such action is required by applicable law.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its respective effective date, (i) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(i) The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of the Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Securities to be sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders may request a reasonable period of time prior to sales of the Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraphs (i) through (iii) of Section 3(b) above during the period for which the Company is required to maintain an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus and any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Holders of the Securities or purchasers of Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

During the period during which the Company is required to maintain an effective Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will prior to the three-year expiration of that Shelf Registration Statement file and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) within a period that avoids any interruption in the ability of Holders of Securities covered by the expiring Shelf Registration Statement to make registered dispositions, a new registration statement relating to the Securities, which shall be deemed the "Shelf Registration Statement" for purposes of this Agreement.

Indemnification
 
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Commission Rule 433 ("Issuer FWP"), relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or Issuer FWP relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; , , that this indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such Indemnified Party.

(b) Each Holder of the Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or Issuer FWP relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, shall reimburse, as incurred, the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its controlling persons.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the
 
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
(e) The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
6. . (a) Additional interest (the "Additional Interest") with respect to the Initial Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (v) below a "Registration Default"):
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances
(i) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the 120th calendar day following the Issue Date,
 
(ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective on or prior to the 180th calendar day following the Issue Date (unless the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case the 240th calendar day following the Issue Date),
(iii) the Subsequent Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to the 240th calendar day following the Issue Date (unless the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case the 300th calendar day following the Issue Date),
(iv) if required, the Shelf Registration Statement with respect to the Initial Securities is not declared effective on or prior to the later of the 120th calendar day after the date of any event described in Section 2 above (unless the Shelf Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case the 180th calendar day after such event) and the 180th calendar day following the Issue Date (unless the Shelf Registration Statement is reviewed by the Commission, in which case the 240th calendar day following the Issue Date),
(v) either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement has been filed and declared effective but after it becomes effective (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective; or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable (except as permitted in paragraph (b)) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, or (3) such Registration Statement is a Shelf Registration Statement that has expired before a replacement Shelf Registration Statement has become effective.
Additional Interest will accrue on the Initial Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to, but excluding, the date on which the Registration Default has been cured, at the rate of 0.25% per year, plus an additional 0.25% per year from and during any period in which the Registration Default has continued for more than 90 days, up to a maximum rate of 0.50% per year. In no event will the additional interest on the Initial Securities exceed 0.50% per year. The Company will have no other liabilities for monetary damages with respect to their registration obligations. With respect to each Holder, the obligation to pay Additional Interest will remain in effect only so long as the Initial Securities held by such Holders are Transfer Restricted Securities.
(b) A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(v)(B) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; , , that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
provided
however
(c) Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 6(a) above will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Initial Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional
 
Interest rate by the principal amount of the Initial Securities, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
(c) "Transfer Restricted Securities" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Transfer Restricted Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of an Initial Security for an Exchange Note, the date on which such Exchange Note is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Initial Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement or (iv) the date on which such Initial Securities is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or is saleable pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.
7. . The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Initial Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Initial Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Initial Securities upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.
Rules 144 and 144A
8. . If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering ("Managing Underwriters") will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such offering.
Underwritten Registrations
No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

ANNEX A
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."
ANNEX B
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Securities, where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. See "Plan of Distribution."
ANNEX C
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities.

In addition, until , 20 , all dealers effecting transactions in the Exchange Securities may be required to deliver a prospectus.
(1)
The Company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers. Exchange Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the Exchange Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
For a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date the Company will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal. The Company has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the Holders of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the Holders of the Securities (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
