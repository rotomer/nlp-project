On December 3, 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Discover Financial Services (the "Registrant") approved a change to the Registrant's fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31 of each year.
The fiscal year change is effective beginning with the Registrant's 2013 fiscal year, which will now begin January 1, 2013 and end December 31, 2013. As a result of the change, the Registrant will have a December 2012 fiscal month transition period, the results of which are expected to be separately reported in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the new fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2013 and in the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013.
The Registrant expects this change to also impact any record dates and payment dates for any dividends to be paid on the Registrant's common stock, if and when as declared by the Board in the future, as compared to such dates in fiscal 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
