SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, DC 20549 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of Earliest Event Reported): February 26, 2003 Commission file number 1-12215 Quest Diagnostics Incorporated One Malcolm Avenue Teterboro, NJ 07608 (201) 393-5000 Delaware (State of Incorporation) 16-1387862 (I.R.S. Employer Identification Number)
Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets On February 26, 2003, Quest Diagnostics accepted for payment approximately 99.1% of the outstanding capital stock of Unilab Corporation ("Unilab"), the leading independent clinical laboratory in California. On February 28, 2003, Quest Diagnostics acquired the remaining shares of Unilab through a merger of Unilab into a wholly owned subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics. In connection with the acquisition, Quest Diagnostics issued 7,054,764 shares of its common stock and paid approximately $297 million in cash. In addition, Quest Diagnostics reserved approximately 292,300 shares for issuance in connection with outstanding Unilab stock options that were converted into options to acquire common stock of Quest Diagnostics. Immediately following the acquisition, Quest Diagnostics had 105,181,208 outstanding shares of common stock. Following the completion of the acquisition, Quest Diagnostics repaid approximately $100 million of bank indebtedness of Unilab and repaid all of the $100.8 million aggregate principal amount of Unilab's 12 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $124 million plus accrued interest. Quest Diagnostics financed the cash portion of the purchase price and related transaction costs and the repayment of substantially all of Unilab's outstanding debt through $450 million in borrowings under an amortizing five year term loan and cash on hand. The term loan carries interest at LIBOR plus 1.3125% and requires principal repayments of the amounts borrowed equal to 16.25%, 20%, 20%, 21.25% and 22.5% in years one through five, respectively. Unilab generated net revenues of $429 million in 2002, has three regional laboratories, approximately 365 patient service centers and 35 rapid response laboratories, and approximately 4,100 employees. Days sales outstanding were 53 at December 31, 2002. During 2002, Unilab processed approximately 15 million requisitions for testing. Quest Diagnostics expects to incur up to $20 million of costs during 2003 and 2004 to integrate Unilab and Quest Diagnostics' existing California operations. Upon completion of the Unilab integration, Quest Diagnostics expects to realize approximately $25 million to $30 million of annual synergies. Quest Diagnostics expects to achieve this annual rate of synergies by the end of 2005. In connection with the acquisition of Unilab, as part of a settlement agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the State of California, Quest Diagnostics entered into an agreement to sell to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc. ("LabCorp") certain assets in northern California, including the assignment of agreements with four independent physician associations ("IPA") and leases for 46 patient service centers (five of which also serve as rapid response laboratories) for $4.5 million. Approximately $27 million in annual net revenues are generated by capitated fees under the IPA contracts and associated fee-for-service testing for physicians whose patients use these patient service centers, as well as from specimens received directly from the IPA physicians. 1

Exhibit 99.1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Unilab Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unilab Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Unilab Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, Unilab Corporation changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets upon adoption of the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP - ------------------------- Los Angeles, California February 18, 2003 (February 28, 2003 as to Note 14)

UNILAB CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT) For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 3
UNILAB CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (amounts in thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 4
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Unilab and Significant Accounting Policies a. Description of Unilab Unilab Corporation ("Unilab" or "the Company") provides clinical laboratory testing services to physicians, managed-care organizations, hospitals and other health care providers primarily in the State of California. b. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Unilab Corporation and its subsidiary, Unilab Acquisition Corporation (100% owned). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. c. Inventory of Supplies Inventories, which consist principally of purchased clinical laboratory supplies, are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. d. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided. The Company's revenue is based on amounts billed or billable for services rendered, net of contractual adjustments and other arrangements made with third-party payors to provide services at less than established billing rates. In addition, certain laboratory services are provided pursuant to managed care contracts which provide for the payment of capitated fees (a fixed monthly fee per individual enrolled with a managed care plan for some or all laboratory tests performed during the month) rather than individual fees for tests actually performed. Revenue under capitated arrangements is recognized in the month when enrolled individuals are entitled to receive services under the terms of the related contracts. Estimated revenue from capitated arrangements contributed 10-15% of total revenues. e. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates with regards to these financial statements relate to accounts receivable. The Company's net accounts receivable balance is determined after deductions for contractual adjustments, which are estimated based on established billing rates made with third party payors, and an allowance for doubtful accounts, which primarily is based on the aging of the accounts and historical collection experience. 5
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED f. Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Company's $98.4 million in senior notes approximates $117.9 million based on quotes from brokers. The carrying amounts of the floating rate bank term loans are considered to be representative of their respective fair values as their interest rates are based on current market rates. The Company believes that the Company's capital lease obligations approximate fair value based on current yields for debt instruments of similar quality and terms. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Company's client base. However, the Company provides services to certain patients covered by various third-party payors, including the Federal and California Medicare/Medicaid programs. Revenue, net of contractual allowances, from direct billings under Federal and California Medicare/ Medicaid programs during each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated 20-25%, 25-30% and 25-30% of revenue, respectively. g. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings are depreciated over 28 years, laboratory and computer equipment are generally depreciated over 7 and 3 years, respectively, and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the related lease. Betterments, which extend the life or add value to equipment are capitalized and depreciated over their remaining useful life. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. h. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and was amortized using the straight-line method over 40 years for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 1995, over 20 years for acquisitions through November 1998 and 10 years for acquisitions through June 30, 2001. For the acquisitions that occurred after June 30, 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141 requires that goodwill remain on the balance sheet and not be amortized. On an annual basis, and when there is reason to suspect that their values have been diminished or impaired, these assets must be tested for impairment, and write-downs may be necessary. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." In accordance with the guidelines of this accounting principle, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but will be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 and ceased amortization of goodwill. The Company performed an impairment analysis of goodwill in 2002 and concluded that the fair value exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company has various operating segments and has aggregated them into one reportable segment. 6
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED i. Other Intangible Assets Customer lists and covenants not to compete are recorded at cost and are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally 10 years for customer lists and 3-5 years for covenants not to compete. The cost of other intangible assets is evaluated periodically and adjusted, if necessary, if later events and circumstances indicate that a permanent decline in value below the current unamortized historical cost has occurred. j. Income Taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the basis for financial reporting purposes and the basis for tax purposes. k. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. l. Reportable Segments The Company has various operating segments which have been aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segment of an Enterprise and Related Information". m. Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per common share has been computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. In 2002, the weighted average number of dilutive stock options were 1.7 million, which reduced net income per share by $0.05. In 2001, the weighted average number of dilutive stock options were 1.0 million, which reduced the net loss per share by $0.01. In 2000, the weighted average number of dilutive stock options were 0.1 million, which had no effect on the net income per share calculation. Options to purchase an aggregate 110,000 shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2002 and an aggregate of 10,000 shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2001 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock for each respective period. Additionally, options to purchase an aggregate of 683,230, 683,230 and 1,959,634 shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' contingent provisions were not satisfied at the end of each reporting period nor would such provisions be satisfied if the end of each reporting period were the end of the options' contingency period. 7
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED n. Merger-Related Charges Direct transaction costs associated with the Merger Agreement are expensed as incurred (see Note 14). o. Stock-Based Compensation As permitted under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"), the Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25") and its related interpretations. Pursuant to APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized for financial reporting purposes using the intrinsic value method when it becomes probable that the options will be exercisable. The amount of compensation expense to be recognized is determined by the excess of the fair value of common stock over the exercise price of the related option at the measurement date. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation: For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company's net income before extraordinary item of $3.4 million would have been reduced to the pro forma amount of $1.0 million, while basic and diluted income per share of $0.11 would have been reduced to $0.03 per share. 8
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED p. Reclassifications Certain 2001 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 financial statement presentation. 2. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment, net consists of the following: Depreciation expense was approximately $6.9 million in 2002, $7.1 million in 2001 and $5.5 million in 2000. 3. Acquisitions On July 21, 2001, Unilab and Medical Arts Clinical Laboratories ("MACL") signed an asset purchase agreement whereby the Company acquired certain assets of MACL. The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of $6.8 million and the assumption of net liabilities of $0.4 million. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the statements of operations include the results of MACL since July 21, 2001. The purchase price was primarily allocated to the net assets acquired based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. Such allocation consisted of accounts receivable of $0.3 million, goodwill of $7.2 million and other liabilities of $0.7 million. The impact of the MACL acquisition in 2001 was not material to the Company's results of operations and consequently, pro forma information is not presented. 4. Legal Proceedings On November 4, 1999, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its board of directors by two of the Company's former stockholders, seeking compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, expenses on behalf of the class of shareholders and a preliminary injunction against a recapitalization of the Company in November 1999. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the proxy statement relating to the Company's recapitalization contained material misrepresentations and omissions in violation of the federal proxy rules and that approval of the terms of the recapitalization amounted to a breach of the fiduciary duties owed to the Company's stockholders by its directors. Plaintiffs and defendants negotiated a settlement in principle of the action, subject to completion of confirmatory discovery and definitive 9
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED documentation relating to the settlement and court approval. However, on November 15, 2000, plaintiffs announced that they would not agree to consummate the settlement. On September 26, 2001, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against the Company and its former board of directors. The second amended complaint adds as a defendant BT Alex. Brown, the investment banker that delivered a fairness opinion in connection with the Company's recapitalization. The complaint asserts additional claims and allegations, including that the defendants brought the Company private in order to obtain large profits for themselves and others, to the detriment of the public shareholders prior to the recapitalization. The complaint also seeks exemplary damages. On April 16, 2002, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. On May 16, 2002, plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint; defendants have renewed their motion to dismiss. The Company believes the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, but because this matter is in the early stages of litigation it is not possible to predict the likelihood of a favorable or unfavorable outcome. In May of 1999, the Company learned of a federal investigation under the False Claims Act relating to its billing practices for certain test procedures including offering apolipoprotein in conjunction with coronary risk panel assessments. In cooperation with the government, the Company has completed the process of gathering and submitting documentation to the Department of Justice regarding the tests with respect to which they requested information. The Company cannot at this time assess what the result of the investigation might be. Remedies available to the government include civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The resolution of such investigation could be material to the Company's operating results for any particular period, depending upon the level of income for such period. On May 31, 2001, the Department of Justice orally offered to settle the claims subject to the federal investigation for a payment by the Company of approximately $2.8 million. The Company cannot assure that this matter will be resolved pursuant to this offer. Although the Company disputes the claims that are the subject of the investigation and hopes to negotiate a settlement with the Department of Justice for less than the government's initial settlement offer, the Company has recorded a legal charge, included in legal and other non-recurring charges in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $2.95 million, which reflects the verbal settlement offer plus certain legal expenses. The Company has settled claims brought by a former employee regarding employment benefits and recorded a legal charge of $0.6 million in December 2001. The Company is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Although the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not determinable, management does not believe that adverse determinations in any or all of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 10
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED 5. Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: The Company recorded a $4.4 million income tax benefit included in the extraordinary loss of $6.3 million related to the extinguishments of debt and a $1.2 million income tax benefit recorded to additional paid in capital attributable to employee stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company reduced its valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets by $38.1 million and recognized a tax benefit of $34.4 million in the statement of operations and $3.7 million as an increase to additional paid in capital. This resulted in a net income tax benefit of $28.6 million recorded in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. A reconciliation between the actual income tax expense (benefit) and income taxes computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to income from operations before income taxes is as follows: 11
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, the Company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits from its deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized. Based on the Company's current operating performance, management believes it is more likely than not it will have sufficient future taxable income to realize the future tax benefits. The Company has an income tax receivable of $2.8 million included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes in the U.S. which are available to offset future taxable income through 2019. At December 31, 2002, available net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes were approximately $48.8 million. Net operating loss carryforwards for California state tax purposes were approximately $13.0 million. Utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. 6. Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consists of the following: 12
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED The Company completed an offering of $155.0 million of senior notes (the "Senior Notes") in September 1999 and entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions for a $185.0 million credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The Senior Notes were issued at a discount at 97.27% per note. The aggregate discount on the Senior Notes approximated $4.2 million and is charged to operations as additional interest expense over the life of the Senior Notes using the effective interest method. The remaining unamortized discount at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $2.3 million and $2.4 million respectively. Interest on the Senior Notes is 12.75% and is payable on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The Senior Notes are due October 2009 and the Company is not obligated to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect to the Senior Notes prior to maturity. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to October 1, 2004, after which the Senior Notes will be redeemable at any time at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at various redemption prices as set forth in the indenture covering such Senior Notes (the "Indenture"), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (see Note 14). The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. In addition, the Indenture limits the ability of the Company to pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or repurchase capital stock and incur additional indebtedness, under certain circumstances. The $185.0 million Credit Facility consists of $160.0 million in term loans ($50.0 million Term A and $110.0 million Term B) and $25.0 million in revolving loans. Any borrowings under the revolving line of credit are due October 2005 and no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Term A loan is due in quarterly principal payments of $1.3 million starting in December 2001 and increasing to $1.7 million in December 2002, $2.1 million in December 2003 and $2.6 million in December 2004 through September 2005. The Term B loan is due in quarterly principal payments of $0.2 million through September 2005 and increasing to $17.6 million in December 2005 through September 2006. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires mandatory repayment for various items, including a percentage of annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility is subject to adjustment determined based on certain levels of financial performance. For LIBOR borrowings, the applicable margin added to LIBOR can range from 2.00% to 3.375% for Term A and revolving loans, and 3.50% to 3.875% for Term B loans. The weighted average interest rates on term loans were 5.0%, 7.9%, and 10.3% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility are subject to certain restrictive covenants. The covenants include, but are not limited to, requirements that the Company maintains specified financial ratios and stays within defined limitations on capital expenditures and additional indebtedness. The Company also cannot declare or pay any dividends. All obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets (see Note 8 for principal repaid with proceeds from an Initial Public Offering "IPO"). 13
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED At December 31, 2002, future scheduled principal payments of long-term debt are as follows (in thousands): 7. Early Extinguishment of Debt With certain of the proceeds from the IPO, on June 11, 2001, the Company repaid $15.0 million of the Term A and $34.2 million of the Term B bank loans and wrote-off $1.0 million in related deferred financing costs. The $1.0 million in deferred financing costs, net of $0.4 million in taxes was recorded as an extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2001. On July 9, 2001, $54.3 million in principal of the $155.0 million in 12.75% senior subordinated notes due October 2009 was repaid with proceeds from the IPO, which represents 35% of the outstanding notes. In order to retire such debt, the Company paid a premium of $6.9 million and additionally wrote-off $1.4 million in note discount and $1.4 million in deferred financing costs. The retirement premium and write-off of the note discount and deferred financing costs, which totaled $9.7 million, is shown as an extraordinary item, net of tax, in the amount of $5.8 million in the statement of operations. 8. Shareholders' Equity Initial Public Offering, Increase in Authorized Shares and Reverse Stock Split On June 6, 2001, the Company completed an IPO of common stock, $0.01 par value. The shares of common stock sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a Registration Statement Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement") (Reg. No. 333-60154) that was declared effective by the SEC on June 5, 2001. The offering commenced on June 6, 2001 where 6,700,000 shares of common stock registered under the Registration Statement were sold at a price of $16.00 per share. The Underwriters exercised an overallotment option of 1,005,000 shares on June 8, 2001. All 1,005,000 shares were sold at a price of $16.00 per share. The aggregate price of the offering amount registered, including the overallotment, was $123.3 million. In connection with the IPO, the Company incurred underwriting discounts and commissions and other related offering expenses in the amount of approximately $10.6 million. The Company received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $112.7 million.

Following such sales, Kelso's ownership percentage decreased to 41.4% from 64.3%. Unilab did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. In connection with this sale, Kelso and the other selling stockholders paid the underwriting discount costs and Unilab paid the other offering expenses of $0.9 million. Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are currently outstanding.

Stock Option Plans 2000 Executive Stock Option Plan. In 2000, the Company adopted, and on June 29, 2000 the Company's stockholders approved, the Executive Stock Option Plan (the "2000 Plan") for certain key employees. The 2000 Plan was designed to attract and retain key employees of Unilab. The 2000 Plan authorizes the issuance of voting common stock to officers and key employees under terms and conditions set by the Company's Board of Directors. The 2000 Plan initially provided for two types of options (Class A and Class B options) that vest as specified by the stock option agreements as follows: (1) in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries starting on November 23, 1999 or on grant date if after November 23, 1999 (Class A options); and (2) based on the occurrence of an exit event (as defined) and achievement of certain share price exit values (Class B options). All options will expire 10 years from November 23, 1999 or from the grant date if after November 23, 1999. On June 5, 2001, the Company amended the 2000 Plan to adjust the vesting provisions of Class B performance options that have been granted to employees. Under the 2000 Plan, as amended, these Class B options converted to Class C options and vest in three discrete tranches contingent upon: o the price of the Company's common stock exceeding a defined average closing price threshold over all of the consecutive trading days within a six month calendar period (certain exclusions may apply if vesting occurs in connection with the announcement of a transaction pursuant to which the Company may be acquired), and a minimum applicable price on the last trading day of such six month calendar period equal to 85% of pre-defined closing price threshold; o the holder of the Class C option being a director, officer or employee of Unilab or any Unilab subsidiary on the vesting date; and o the defined average closing price thresholds for the granted and outstanding options are $17.79 for 760,974 options, $22.54 for 591,870 options and $27.88 for 489,972 options. On June 29, 2001, the Company amended the 2000 Plan to accelerate the vesting of the Class A service options held by the Company's non-employee consultants. The modification to fully vest the Class A non-employee service options resulted in compensation expense of $1.4 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. The Company has not amended the vesting provisions of any Class B performance options held by the Company's non-employee consultants. Class B options held by consultants will 16
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED continue to vest upon the occurrence of an exit event and Kelso's realization of a certain minimum return on its investments in the Company. On October 17, 2001, to assure consistency among new option grants, the Company amended the 2000 Plan so as to allow options granted under that plan to be in accordance with the Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan. And on February 6, 2002, the Company amended both Plans to clarify that the Board has authority to make certain equitable adjustments thereunder. 2001 Stock Option Plan. On May 15, 2001 the Company adopted, and on May 16, 2001 the shareholders approved the Unilab Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan (the "2001 Plan"). The 2001 Plan is intended to promote the interests of Unilab and its stockholders by providing officers and other employees with appropriate incentives to encourage them to enter into and continue in the Company's employ and to acquire a proprietary interest in the equity success of Unilab; to provide incentives to the Company's non-employee directors that are directly linked to increases in stock value; and to reward the performance of individual officers, other employees, consultants and non-employee directors in fulfilling their personal responsibilities for long-range achievements. The Company has reserved 500,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2001 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance is generally subject to equitable adjustment upon the occurrence of any stock dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, repurchase, or share exchange, or other similar corporate transaction or event. No option holder shall have any rights with respect to the shares covered by an award under the 2001 Plan until the shares have been reduced to such person's possession. The following presents the status of the Company's stock option plans as of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002: 17
UNILAB CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED The following is summary information about the Company's stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002: Stock-Based Compensation For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized stock-based compensation charges in the statement of operation totaling $23.8 million, comprised of $1.5 million non-cash charges related to service options issued to non-employee consultants that were accelerated on June 29, 2001 and $22.3 million non-cash charges related to certain Class C performance-based stock options that met the contingent vesting provisions on December 6, 2001. Such charges relate to employees and consultants whose expenses would have otherwise been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. These amounts increased additional paid-in capital. Expense for the one remaining tranche of 489,972 Class C performance options held by employees and for the 193,258 Class B options held by non-employee consultants may be recognized in the future if the contingent provisions are met. Any ultimate possible charge is difficult to determine since the expense is based on future stock price (see Note 14). No options were granted for the year ended December 31, 2002. The weighted average fair value of options granted for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and were $13.26 and $4.07. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2001: risk-free interest rates of 4.3% to 5.4%, no dividend yield, expected life of approximately 10 years which equals the remaining lives of the grants, and an expected volatility of 50%. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2000: risk-free interest rates of 5.3% to 6.4%, no dividend yield, expected life of approximately 10 years which equals the remaining lives of the grants, and an expected volatility of 50%. 10.

The Company has employment and severance agreements with its principal officers and certain other key employees. Such agreements expire at various dates through December 2005 and most automatically renew for successive one or two year periods, depending on the employee, until one of the parties gives notice of termination in accordance with the agreement. The agreements also provide for annual bonuses for certain officers and key employees, dependent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives. In addition, the agreements for certain employees provide for annual deferred compensation equal to 8% of the employees' cash compensation (inclusive of bonuses) for the year. The aggregate commitment under these agreements, excluding bonuses and any deferred compensation related thereto, is approximately $3.2 million at December 31, 2002. The Company may terminate the employment agreements without cause on specified advance notice by providing severance pay equal to one to two times, depending on the employee, of the current annual base salary plus certain other benefits. In addition, the employment agreements grant these employees the right to receive one to three times, depending on the employee, their annual salary and bonus, plus continuation of certain benefits and acceleration of certain stock options, if there is a change in control of the Company (as defined) and a termination of such employees or certain other events within one to three years thereafter.

Recent Accounting Pronouncement In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," which elaborates on required disclosures by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and clarifies the need for a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company does not expect that the provisions of FIN 45 will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3.
