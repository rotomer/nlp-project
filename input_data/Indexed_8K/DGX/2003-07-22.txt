Exhibit 99.1 ------------ QUEST DIAGNOSTICS EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 29% IN SECOND QUARTER 2003 TETERBORO, N.J., JULY 22, 2003--Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003, net income increased to $120.4 million from $87.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. Earnings per diluted share increased 29% to $1.12 from $0.87 in 2002. Second quarter revenues increased 14% over the prior year level to $1.2 billion and reflect the acquisition of Unilab Corporation, which was completed on February 28, 2003. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 10%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.5% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improvements in test and payer mix. The remainder of the revenue growth was generated by non-clinical testing businesses. On a pro forma basis for the second quarter, assuming that Unilab had been part of Quest Diagnostics since January 1, 2002, revenues increased 3.4%, revenue per requisition increased 5.1%, and clinical testing volume decreased 2.3%, compared to the prior year period. "We had another strong quarter," said Kenneth W. Freeman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Earnings per share increased 29% and cash generation was excellent. EBITDA margins continued to expand, increasing by three percentage points as a result of revenue growth and efficiencies from our Six Sigma and standardization initiatives." For the second quarter, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), were $259 million, or 21.2% of revenues, compared to $195 million, or 18.2% of revenues in 2002. Bad debt expense improved to 4.8% of revenues compared to 5.2% for the prior year period. Days sales outstanding improved to 47 days from 52 days a year ago and 49 days at the end of the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was $169 million compared to $165 million in 2002. During the quarter, the company repaid $86 million of debt, repurchased $10 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $38 million. For the first half of 2003, net income increased to $208.4 million from $153.8 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share increased 29% to $1.98 from $1.54 in the prior year. Revenues increased 14.7% to $2.3 billion. EBITDA was $458 million, or 19.8% of revenues, compared to $350 million, or 17.4% of revenues in 2002. Capital expenditures were $76 million. For the full year 2003, earnings are expected to increase between 24% and 27% to between $4.00 and $4.10 per diluted share, before charges associated with the Unilab acquisition. Revenues are expected to grow 14% to 15%. Volume is expected to grow 10% to 11% and revenue per requisition is expected to grow 3% to 4%. On a pro forma basis, assuming that the acquisitions of Unilab and American Medical Laboratories had been completed on January 1, 2002, volume is expected to decrease 1% to 2% and revenue per requisition is expected to increase 4% to 5%. EBITDA is expected to approximate 20% of revenues. Cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $170 million and $180 million. For the third quarter, earnings are expected to increase to between $1.06 and $1.11 per diluted share, before charges associated with the Unilab acquisition. Revenues are expected to grow 13% to 15%, with volume growth of 10% to 11% and revenue per requisition increasing 3% to 4%. On a pro forma
basis, assuming that Unilab had been part of Quest Diagnostics since January 1, 2002 volume is expected to decrease 1% to 2% and revenue per requisition is expected to increase 4% to 5%.

Notes to Financial Tables 1) Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares primarily represent stock options. The following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123": The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 2) Other, net, which represents income for each of the periods presented, includes equity earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures and miscellaneous gains and losses. 3) EBITDA represents income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The following table reconciles net income, representing the most comparable measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, to EBITDA. In addition, the calculations to determine net income as a percentage of net revenues and EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues are presented. A reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities is presented on the face of the statement of cash flows. EBITDA is presented and discussed because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net income and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's performance and ability to meet its future debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net income (or any other measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States) as a measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. 6
A. Calculated by dividing net income by net revenues. B. Calculated by dividing EBITDA by net revenues. 4) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing activities and meet its future debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 7
5) The following table presents management's estimates of various financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and the three months ended September 30, 2003 and excludes charges associated with the Unilab acquisition. The table also reconciles estimated net income to estimated EBITDA and presents the calculation of each as a percentage of estimated net revenues: A. Calculated by dividing the mid-point of estimated net income by the mid point of estimated net revenues. B. Calculated by dividing the mid-point of estimated EBITDA by the mid point of estimated net revenues. 8
