The initial quarterly dividend will be payable on January 23, 2004 to shareholders of record on January 8, 2004. Through September 30, 2003, $141 million of share repurchases had been made under the original authorization of $300 million approved by the Board in May, 2003. The dividend and the expansion of the repurchase program by an additional $300 million are expected to be funded through free cash flow and will have no significant impact on the company's growth strategy or its ability to finance future growth. The company had approximately 104 million shares outstanding as of September 30, 2003. "The initiation of a dividend, coupled with the expansion of our share repurchase program, will enable us to return additional value to our shareholders while continuing to invest in growth opportunities," said Kenneth W.

Exhibit 99.2 QUEST DIAGNOSTICS EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 29% IN THIRD QUARTER 2003 --Earnings per Share Expected to Grow 12-15% in 2004 -- TETERBORO, N.J., OCTOBER 21, 2003--Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, net income increased to $120 million from $87 million in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings per diluted share increased 29% to $1.12 from $0.87 in 2002. Separately, the company also announced that its Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend and increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $300 million. Third quarter revenues increased 15.3% over the prior year level to $1.2 billion and reflect the acquisition of Unilab Corporation, which was completed on February 28, 2003. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 10.8%. Revenue per requisition increased 3.8% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improvements in test and payer mix. The remainder of the revenue growth was generated by non-clinical testing businesses. On a pro forma basis for the third quarter, assuming that Unilab had been part of Quest Diagnostics since January 1, 2002, revenues increased 4.6%, revenue per requisition increased 5.6%, and clinical testing volume declined by 1.5%, compared to the prior year period. "Exceptional financial performance during the quarter was principally driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from our Six Sigma and standardization efforts," said Kenneth W. Freeman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In 2004, we expect earnings per share to increase between 12% and 15%, and cash from operations to exceed $600 million, driven by continued organic revenue growth and operating efficiencies. Our expectation for continuing strong cash flow enables us to initiate a dividend and expand our share repurchase program, while pursuing growth opportunities." For the third quarter of 2003, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $256 million, or 20.9% of revenues, compared to $192 million, or 18.2% of revenues in 2002. Bad debt expense improved to 4.8% of revenues compared to 5.1% for the prior year period. Days sales outstanding were 48 days, compared to 51 days a year ago. Cash flow from operations was $173 million for the third quarter, compared to $132 million in 2002. During the quarter, the company repurchased $131 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $46 million. For the first nine months of 2003, net income increased to $328 million from $240 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share increased 29% to $3.10 from $2.41 in the prior year. Revenues increased 15% to $3.5 billion. EBITDA was $714 million, or 20.2% of revenues, compared to $543 million, or 17.7% of revenues in 2002. The company repurchased $141 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $122 million. For the fourth quarter 2003, earnings are expected to be between $0.95 and $1.00 per diluted share. Revenues are expected to grow 13% to 14%. Volume is expected to increase 11% to 12% and revenue
per requisition is expected to grow 2% to 3%. On a pro forma basis, assuming that the acquisition of Unilab had been completed on January 1, 2002, volume is expected to decrease 1% to 2% and revenue per requisition is expected to increase 3% to 4%. EBITDA is expected to be between 19% and 20% of revenues. In addition, for the full year 2003, earnings are expected to increase between 25% and 27% to between $4.05 and $4.10 per diluted share, before charges associated with the Unilab integration. Cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $170 million and $180 million. For the full year 2004, earnings per share are expected to increase between 12% and 15%, before charges associated with the Unilab integration. Revenues are expected to increase approximately 5%, driven by continued improvements in revenue per requisition, modest improvements in requisition volume, and the impact of Unilab. Inclusion of a full 12 months of revenues from Unilab, which was acquired on February 28, 2003, is expected to increase reported total company revenues by approximately 1.5%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues is expected to approach 18%. Historically, as a percentage of revenues, operating income is approximately 3% lower than EBITDA. Cash flow from operations is expected to exceed $600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $180 million to $190 million.

Notes to Financial Tables 1) Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares primarily represent stock options. The following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123": The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 6
2) Other operating (income) expense, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities such as gains and losses associated with the disposal of operating assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, other operating (income) expense, net includes $3.3 million of gains on the sale of certain operating assets, partially offset by a $1.1 million charge associated with the integration of Unilab. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, other operating (income) expense, net includes a $1.5 million charge associated with the integration of American Medical Laboratories. In addition, other operating (income) expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 includes the cost of a contract settlement. 3) Other income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities such as gains and losses associated with investments and other non-operating assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, other income (expense), net includes a $3.8 million gain on the sale of an investment, partially offset by losses on miscellaneous non-operating assets. 4) EBITDA represents income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The following table reconciles net income, representing the most comparable measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, to EBITDA. In addition, the calculations to determine net income as a percentage of net revenues and EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues are presented. A reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities is presented on the face of the statement of cash flows. EBITDA is presented and discussed because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net income and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's performance and ability to meet its future debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net income (or any other measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States) as a measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. A. Calculated by dividing net income by net revenues. B. Calculated by dividing EBITDA by net revenues. C. Presented for comparative purposes only. D. Calculated by dividing operating income by net revenues. 7
5) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing activities and meet its future debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 6) The following table presents management's estimates of various financial measures for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and excludes charges associated with the Unilab acquisition. The table also reconciles estimated net income to estimated EBITDA and presents the calculation of each as a percentage of estimated net revenues: A. Calculated by dividing the mid-point of net income by the mid-point of net revenues. B. Calculated by dividing the mid-point of EBITDA by the mid-point of net revenues. 8
