Notes to Financial Tables 1) Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares primarily represent stock options. The following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123": The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Certain options granted during the fourth quarter of 2003 were issued prior to the declaration of the quarterly cash dividend and as such carry a 0% dividend yield, reducing the weighted average dividend yield for the period. 2) Other operating (income) expense, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities such as gains and losses associated with the disposal of operating assets. For the three months ended December 31, 2002 other operating (income) expense, net includes a $1.8 million pretax gain on the sale of certain operating assets. 3) During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on January 23, 2004 to shareholders of record on January 8, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded the estimated dividend payable of $15.4 million. 6
4) EBITDA represents income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The following table reconciles net income, representing the most comparable measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, to EBITDA. In addition, the calculations to determine net income as a percentage of net revenues, operating income as a percentage of net revenues and EBITDA as a percentage of net revenues are presented. A reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities is presented on the face of the statement of cash flows. EBITDA is presented and discussed because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net income and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's performance and ability to meet its future debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net income (or any other measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States) as a measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. A. Calculated by dividing net income by net revenues. B. Calculated by dividing EBITDA by net revenues. C. Presented for comparative purposes only. D. Calculated by dividing operating income by net revenues. 5) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing activities and meet its future debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 7
