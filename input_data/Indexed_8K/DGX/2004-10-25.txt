Notes to Financial Tables 1) Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive common shares primarily represent stock options. The following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123": The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 2) Other operating expense, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities including gains and losses associated with the disposal of operating assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, other operating expense, net includes a $10.3 million charge associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process. 3) Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, includes a $2.9 million charge representing the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the second quarter 2004 refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility. 4) In 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, which permits the Company to purchase up to $600 million of its common stock. In July 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional $300 million of its common stock. For the three months ended September 30, 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $81.64 per share for a total of $110 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $83.84 per share for a total of $381 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased approximately 8.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $74.82 for a total of $639 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the Company has reissued approximately 2.8 million of these shares in connection with employee benefit plans. At September 30, 2004, $261 million of the share repurchase authorization remained available. 6
5) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing activities and meet its future debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 6) Net income before special charges excludes the charges associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process and the second quarter 2004 refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility. Operating income before special charge excludes the charge associated with the CEO succession process. Both operating income and net income before special charges, including per common share amounts, are presented because management believes that it is a useful adjunct to other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, including reported operating income and net income since it is a meaningful measure of the Company's on-going operating performance and is on a basis consistent with prior reported results. Operating income before special charge and net income before special charges, including per common share amounts, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to reported operating income and net income as an indicator of performance. The following table reconciles operating income and net income before special charges to reported results: 7
7) Estimated comparable diluted earnings per common share represents management's estimate of diluted earnings per common share before charges associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process, the second quarter refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility, and the required change in accounting for the Company's contingent convertible debentures. Estimated comparable diluted earnings per common share is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to estimated diluted earnings per common share and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance and is on a basis consistent with previous estimates of diluted earnings per common share. Estimated comparable diluted earnings per common share is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to estimated diluted earnings per common share. The following table reconciles estimated diluted earnings per common share to estimated comparable diluted earnings per common share: 8
