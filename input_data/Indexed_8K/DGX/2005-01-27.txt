Notes to Financial Tables 1) Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding. Due to a required change in accounting effective December 31, 2004, the Company included the dilutive effect of its contingent convertible debentures in its dilutive earnings per common share calculations using the if-converted method, regardless of whether or not the holders of these securities were permitted to exercise their conversion rights, and retroactively restated previously reported diluted earnings per common share. References to the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, including diluted earnings per common share calculations and related disclosures, have been restated to give effect to the required change in accounting for all periods presented. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (using the if-converted method) is as follows: 6
2) The following table presents net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for stock option awards and discounts granted for stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123": The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 3) Other operating (income) expense, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities including gains and losses associated with the disposal of operating assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, other operating expense, net includes a $10.3 million second quarter charge associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process. 4) Interest expense, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, includes a $2.9 million charge representing the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the second quarter 2004 refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility. 5) In 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, which permitted the Company to purchase up to $600 million of its common stock. In July 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to an additional $300 million of its common stock. Under a separate authorization from the Board of Directors, in December 2004 the Company repurchased 2.7 million shares of its common stock for approximately $254 million from GlaxoSmithKline plc. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $93.47 per share for $353 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $88.21 per share for $735 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program, the Company has repurchased approximately 12.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $80.54 for $992 million. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company has reissued approximately 0.9 million shares and 3.6 million shares, respectively, primarily in connection with employee benefit plans. At December 31, 2004, $162 million of the share repurchase authorizations remained available. In January 2005, the Board of Directors expanded the share repurchase authorization by an additional $350 million, bringing the total amount authorized and available for repurchases to $512 million. 7
6) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing activities and meet its future debt service requirements. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 7) Net income before special charges excludes the second quarter 2004 charges associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process and the refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility. Operating income before special charge excludes the charge associated with the CEO succession process. Both operating income and net income before special charges, including per common share amounts, are presented because management believes they are useful adjuncts to other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, including reported operating income and net income since they are meaningful measures of the Company's on-going operating performance and are on a basis consistent with prior reported results. Operating income before special charge and net income before special charges, including per common share amounts, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as alternatives to reported operating income and net income as an indicator of performance. The following table reconciles operating income and net income before special charges to reported results: (A) Calculated by dividing net income before special charges by the weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (before the required change in accounting for the Company's contingent convertible debentures) in footnote 1 (B) Calculated by dividing operating income by net revenues 8
8) Before the impact of the accounting change for equity-based compensation, the Company expects 2005 diluted earnings per common share to be between $5.45 and $5.55, operating income to be between 18% and 19% of revenues and cash from operations to approach $800 million. The Company has not finalized what, if any, changes may be made to its equity compensation plans in light of the accounting change, and therefore is not yet in a position to quantify its impact. The Company expects to announce the impact in connection with reporting its second quarter 2005 financial results. Assuming there are no changes to the Company's equity compensation plans, and an adoption date of July 1, 2005 for the new accounting standard, the Company estimates that the adoption of the new accounting standard will reduce diluted earnings per common share by up to $0.23 per share and operating income, as a percentage of revenues, by up to approximately 1%. The impact on cash from operations of adopting the new accounting standard cannot be estimated at this time. 9) In December 2004, the Company called for redemption all of its outstanding contingent convertible debentures due November 2021. Under the terms of the debentures, the holders of the debentures had an option to submit their debentures for redemption at par plus accrued and unpaid interest or convert their debentures into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $87.50 per share. The outstanding principal of the debentures at December 31, 2004 is classified as a current liability within short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. As of January 18, 2005, the redemption was completed and $0.4 million of principal was redeemed for cash and $249.6 million of principal was converted into approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. 9
