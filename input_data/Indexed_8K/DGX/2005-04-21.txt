Notes to Financial Tables 1) Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding. Due to a required change in accounting effective December 31, 2004, the Company included the dilutive effect of its contingent convertible debentures in its earnings per share calculations using the if-converted method, regardless of whether or not the holders of these securities were permitted to exercise their conversion rights, and retroactively restated previously reported diluted earnings per common share. References to the previously reported diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, including diluted earnings per common share calculations and related disclosures, have been restated to give effect to the required change in accounting for all periods presented. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (using the if-converted method) is as follows: 6
2) The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), and related interpretations and has chosen to adopt the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" ("SFAS 148"). The following table presents net income and earnings per share, had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost associated with stock option awards and employee stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148: The fair value of each stock option award granted prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of each stock option award granted subsequent to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option-valuation model. Management believes a lattice-based option-valuation model provides a more accurate measure of fair value. The expected volatility in connection with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock, while the expected volatility under the lattice-based option-valuation model was based on the current and the historical implied volatilities from traded options of the Company's stock. The weighted average assumptions used in valuing options granted in the periods presented are noted in the following table. 3) For the three months ended March 31, 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $99.16 per share for $62 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2005, the Company has reissued approximately 2.8 million shares and 0.8 million shares in connection with the conversion of its contingent convertible debentures and for employee benefit plans, respectively. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in May 2003, the Company has repurchased approximately 12.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $81.45 for approximately $1.1 billion. At March 31, 2005, $450 million of the share repurchase authorizations remained available. 7
4) Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a company's ability to fund investing and certain financing activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: 5) In December 2004, the Company called for redemption all of its outstanding contingent convertible debentures due November 2021. Under the terms of the debentures, the holders of the debentures had an option to submit their debentures for redemption at par plus accrued and unpaid interest or convert their debentures into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $87.50 per share. The outstanding principal of the debentures at December 31, 2004 was classified as a current liability within short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. As of January 18, 2005, the redemption was completed and $0.4 million of principal was redeemed for cash and $249.6 million of principal was converted into approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. 6) Diluted earnings per common share before special charges for the year ended December 31, 2004, excludes the second quarter 2004 charges associated with the acceleration of certain pension obligations in connection with the CEO succession process and the refinancing of the Company's bank debt and credit facility. Diluted earnings per common share before special charges is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, including reported diluted earnings per common share since it is a meaningful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Diluted earnings per common share before special charges is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered an alternative indicator of performance to reported diluted earnings per common share. The following table reconciles diluted earnings per common share before special charges to reported results: 8
