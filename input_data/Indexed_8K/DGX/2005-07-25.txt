The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (using the if-converted method) is as follows:

The fair value of each stock option award granted prior to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of each stock option award granted subsequent to January 1, 2005 was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. Management believes a lattice-based option valuation model provides a more accurate measure of fair value. The expected volatility in connection with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock, while the expected volatility under the lattice-based option-valuation model was based on the current and the historical implied volatilities from traded options of the Company's stock. The weighted average assumptions used in valuing options granted in the periods presented are noted in the following table.
