Exhibit 99.1
LYNDHURST, N.J., OCTOBER 20, 2005Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005, net income increased to $135 million or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $130 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2004. Earnings per share were reduced by $0.05 in the third quarter of 2005 as a result of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and the write-down of an investment.
During the quarter, the impact of the hurricanes reduced total revenues by approximately half a percent, operating income by $11 million, and earnings per share by $0.03. This includes a $6.2 million charge, included in other operating expense, primarily related to forgiveness of amounts owed by patients and physicians in the affected areas, and related property damage.
During the third quarter of 2005, total revenues grew 6.4% over the prior-year level to $1.4 billion, driven by strength in clinical testing operations. Clinical testing revenues grew 7.1%. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew approximately 4.0%, and revenue per requisition grew 3.0%. Performance at the company's test kit manufacturing business (NID) reduced total revenue growth by about half a percent.
Operating income for the quarter was $243 million, or 17.7% of revenues, compared to $232 million, or 18.0% of revenues, in 2004. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was negatively impacted 1.2% due to the hurricanes and the performance of NID.
Bad debt expense was 4.3% of revenues, compared to 4.6% a year ago. Days sales outstanding improved to 45 days, compared to 48 days a year ago. Cash from operations totaled $178 million for the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased $98 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $54 million.
"Our business showed strong growth during the quarter as we continued to enhance our value proposition for patients and physicians," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics. "We are focused on driving profitable growth, and we look forward to joining together soon with LabOne to further enhance our leadership position."
Year-to-Date Performance
For the first nine months of 2005, net income was $416 million, or $2.02 per diluted share. This compares to $373 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, in 2004. Revenues increased 5.9% to $4.1 billion. Operating income for 2005 was $734 million, or 18.0% of revenues, compared to $671 million, or 17.4% of revenues, in 2004. Cash from operations increased to $548 million from $535 million in 2004. During the first nine months of 2005, the company repurchased $190 million in common stock and made capital expenditures of $178 million.
Outlook for 2005
The company expects full year earnings per diluted share of between $2.61 and $2.64. This reflects the $0.05 per share impact of the hurricanes and the investment write-down in the third quarter. This also includes an estimated fourth quarter impact of $0.02 per share from the continuing disruptions from the hurricanes and $0.05 per share from the performance of NID. Previously, the company had anticipated earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.78. For the full year 2005, revenue growth is expected to approach 5.5%, operating income is expected to approach 18% of revenues; cash from operations is expected to approximate $750 million; and capital expenditures are expected to approximate $235 million. The outlook for 2005 excludes operating performance of LabOne and integration costs associated with its acquisition, which is expected to close in early November.
