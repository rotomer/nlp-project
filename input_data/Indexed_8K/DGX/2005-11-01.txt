Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 25, 2005, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (the "Company") and certain of the Company's subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") entered into a purchase agreement ("the Purchase Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (the "Initial Purchasers"), to sell $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.125% Senior Notes due 2010 (the "Notes due 2010") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Notes due 2015" and together with the Notes due 2010, the "Notes") and the guarantees of the Notes (the "Guarantees") in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the "Private Placement"). The Notes are expected to be resold by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company completed the sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers on October 31, 2005 with net proceeds to the Company of $892,000,000. The Purchase Agreement contains customary terms and conditions.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2006. The 2010 Notes will mature on November 1, 2010. The 2015 Notes will mature on November 1, 2015. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with the Company's other and future senior unsecured obligations. Each Guarantee will be a senior unsecured obligation of the Guarantor issuing such Guarantee and will rank equally with other existing and future senior unsecured obligations of such Guarantor. The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes of each series, at any time, at applicable redemption prices. The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 27, 2001 among the guarantors (as defined therein) and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of June 27, 2001, among the Company, the Initial Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined therein) party thereto as guarantors, and the Trustee, as further supplemented by a second supplemental indenture, dated as of November 26, 2001, among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined therein) party thereto and the Trustee, as further supplemented by a third supplemental indenture, dated as of April 4, 2002, among the Company, the additional Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined therein) party thereto and the Trustee, as further supplemented by a fourth supplemental indenture, dated as of March 19, 2003, among the Company, the additional Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined therein) party thereto and the Trustee, as further supplemented by a fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of April 16, 2004, among the Company, the additional Subsidiary Guarantor (as defined therein) party thereto and the Trustee and further supplemented by a sixth supplemental indenture dated October 31, 2005 (collectively, the "Indenture") among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, will limit the ability of the Company and the Guarantors to create certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate; merge or transfer all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Company's subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and incur indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Indenture provides for customary events of default.
 
 
 
 
 
On October 31, 2005, the Company, Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") providing the holders of the Notes certain rights relating to the registration of the Notes under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to conduct a registered exchange offer for the Notes or cause to become effective a shelf registration statement providing for the resale of the Notes. The Company is required to: (i) file a registration statement ("the Registration Statement") within 90 days after October 31, 2005, intended to enable holders to exchange the Notes and Guarantees for publicly registered notes and guarantees; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective within 150 days after October 31, 2005; (iii) use reasonable best efforts to consummate the exchange offer within 180 days after October 31, 2005; and (iv) file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes and Guarantees if the Company cannot effect the exchange offer within the time periods referred to above under the circumstances specified in the Registration Rights Agreement.
The foregoing descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the applicable agreement, each of which is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.01. Significant Acquisitions or Dispositions
 
On November 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of LabOne, Inc. ("LabOne") through the merger of Fountain, Inc. ("Fountain"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into LabOne, with LabOne being the surviving entity in the merger (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, LabOne will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon consummation of the transaction, each share of LabOne's outstanding common stock (other than shares held by LabOne or by any of its subsidiaries and shares owned by the Company or Fountain or any shares held by shareholders that properly demanded the payment of fair value of such shares under Missouri Law) was cancelled and converted into the right to receive $43.90 in cash, per share, without interest. The aggregate consideration paid in connection with the Acquisition was approximately $934 million, including approximately $132 million attributable to settlement of certain 3.50% Convertible Senior Debentures of LabOne. The Company and Fountain funded the transaction with proceeds from a $900 million offering of the Notes, as described in Item 1.01, and from the Company's cash on hand.
The Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the financial statements and pro forma financial information required to be filed pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, within 71 days of the date this current report on Form 8-K was required to be filed.

This Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection and is a continuing guarantee and shall apply to all Guarantor Obligations whenever arising.

. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder are absolute and unconditional irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Indenture or this Note, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors agrees that this Guarantee may be enforced by the Holder of this Note without the necessity at any time of proceeding against the Company or any other Person (including a co-guarantor) or to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right. Each of the Initial Guarantors further agrees that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Holder of this Note from suing on this Note or the Indenture or from exercising any other rights available under this Note and the Indenture, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and shall not constitute a discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder and under the Indenture; it being the purpose and the intent of each Subsidiary Guarantor that its obligations under this Note and under the Indenture shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances.

Each Initial Subsidiary Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guarantor Obligations or acceptance of this Guarantee.

provided, however

Modifications
.

A-9
indulgences or be released; all without notice to or further assent by such Subsidiary Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon, notwithstanding any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal, acceleration, modification, indulgence or release.

Remedies
. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors further agrees, to the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so, that as between each such Subsidiary Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holder and the Trustee, on the other hand, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five of the Indenture for the purposes of this guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition extant under any applicable bankruptcy law preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby.
Rights of Contribution
. The Subsidiary Guarantors, in connection with payments made hereunder, shall have contribution rights against the other Subsidiary Guarantors as permitted under applicable law. Such contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Note and no Subsidiary Guarantor shall exercise such rights of contribution until all Guarantor Obligations have been paid in full.
Limitation of Guaranty
. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in the Indenture, to the extent the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state or otherwise and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).
Release of Guarantors
. Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of its obligations contained in the Note, this Subsidiary Guarantee and pursuant to the Indenture;
provided

however
, that if (a) an Subsidiary Guarantor does not guarantee any Indebtedness of the Company the amount of which, when added together with any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company guaranteed by its Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, would exceed $50 million in the aggregate, excluding the Notes of this series, and all outstanding Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor would have been permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section 1011 of the Indenture measured at the time of the release and discharge as described in this paragraph, (b) the Notes of this series are defeased and discharged pursuant to Article Fourteen of the Indenture, or (c) all or substantially all of the assets of such Initial Subsidiary Guarantor or all of the capital stock of such Initial Subsidiary Guarantor is sold (including by issuance, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, then in each case of (a), (b) or (c) above, such Subsidiary Guarantor or the corporation acquiring such assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be automatically and without any further action on the part of any party to the Indenture, and upon notice to

provided, however
, that neither the Company nor the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation other than as to matters and transactions relating to the Registration Statement, in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;
(x) cooperate with the selling Holders and the underwriter(s), if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders or the underwriter(s), if any, may request at least two Business Days prior to any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities made by such Holders or underwriter(s);
(xi) use its best efforts to cause the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriter(s), if any, to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities, subject to the proviso contained in Section 6(c)(xii) hereof;

deposit with the Depository Trust Company and take all other action necessary to ensure that all such Securities are eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust Company;
(xvi) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the NASD and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter (including any "qualified independent underwriter") that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASD; and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become effective and approved by such governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the Holders selling Transfer Restricted Securities to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities;
(xiv) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally available to its securityholders, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 (which need not be audited) for the twelve-month period (A) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which Transfer Restricted Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm commitment or best efforts Underwritten Offering or (B) if not sold to underwriters in such an offering, beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement;

If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the time period regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof to and including the date when each selling Holder covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xvi) hereof or shall have received the Advice;
provided, however,
that no such extension

Indemnification.
(a) The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder and (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person") and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and
 
15
 
 
agents of any Holder or any controlling person (any Person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified Holder"), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing, settling, compromising, paying or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any Indemnified Holder), joint or several, directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any free writing prospectus or preliminary prospectus used in connection with any transaction contemplated hereby, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors may otherwise have.
In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors in writing;
provided, however,
that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Such Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid, as incurred, by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Holder is not entitled to indemnification hereunder). The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be designated by the Holders. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' prior written consent, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, and each of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.

(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors and their respective directors and officers who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors and the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives, agents or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, and the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives, agents and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors from the Initial Placement) and the Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable
 
17
 
 
by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.

Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiary Guarantors have previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to their securities to any Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being tendered or registered;
provided, however,
that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser with respect to which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure is to be effective.

If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party for the indemnified party's reasonable fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (A) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (B) provides written notice to the indemnified party disputing the unpaid balance in good faith and substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement, subject to provision of notice by the indemnified party in accordance with (i) and (ii) above.
                
SECTION 8.                . If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand from the offering of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
                
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth on the cover of the bear to the aggregate initial offering prices of the Securities (including the Guarantees) as set forth on such cover Offering Memorandum.
                
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantors, or by the Initial Purchasers, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
                
The Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
                
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities (including the Guarantees) sold by it exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
                
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
                
For purposes of this Section 8, (a) each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and (b) each director of the Company and each Guarantor, and each person, if any, who controls the Company and each Guarantor, as the case may be, within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and each Guarantor. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities (including the Guarantees) set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
                
SECTION 9.                . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of the Securities (including the Guarantees) to the Initial Purchasers.

(a)           . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Offering Memorandum, any material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there shall have occurred a downgrading in the rating of the Company's debt securities by any nationally recognized securities rating agency, or if such securities rating agency shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Company debt securities or (iii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any
Termination; General
outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Securities and the Guarantees or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities and the Guarantees, or (iv) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or limited by the Commission or the NASDAQ National Market System, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the NASDAQ National Market System has been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
                
(b)           . If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 11.              . If one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail at Closing Time to purchase the Securities (including the Guarantees) which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), the Representatives shall have the right, but not the obligation, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or any other Initial Purchasers, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Initial Purchasers
                
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchasers from liability in respect of its default.
                
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either (i) the Representatives or (ii) the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes any person substituted for an Initial Purchaser under this Section 11.
                
SECTION 12.              . If the Company and the Guarantors shall fail at Closing Time to sell the number of Securities (including the Guarantees) that they are obligated to sell hereunder, then this Agreement shall terminate without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party; provided, however, that the provisions of Sections 1, 4, 7, 8 and 9 shall remain in full force and effect. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve the Company or the Guarantors from liability, if any, in respect of such default.
Default by the Company and the Guarantors
