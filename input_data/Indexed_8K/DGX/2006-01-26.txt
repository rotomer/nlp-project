Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.8% and revenue per requisition increased 2.8%.
Fourth quarter operating income was $234 million, or 16.3% of revenues, compared to $221 million, or 17.2% of revenues, in 2004. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 2% due to the performance at NID, and approximately 0.5% due to the inclusion of LabOne.

During the quarter the company repurchased 4.0 million common shares for $200 million. Capital expenditures were $46 million.

"We are disappointed with the performance at our test kit manufacturing subsidiary, NID, and are actively working to address the issues. As we look to 2006, we expect another strong year of performance at Quest Diagnostics."
