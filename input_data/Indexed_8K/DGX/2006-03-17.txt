          Base Salary
           On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved the following annual base salaries for fiscal year 2006 for the Company's chief executive officer and other executive officers (effective January 1, 2006):
          Cash Bonus Awards
          Annual cash bonus incentives are paid to the chief executive officer and other executive officers in accordance with the SMIP. Consistent with past practice, on February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee established additional target percentages in respect of each executive officer's base salary to be used in determining the bonus awards for fiscal year 2006. Whether or not an executive officer receives his target percentage bonus will be based on three factors: first, financial performance, which is to be measured against objectives established for earnings per share and revenue growth; second, the Company's performance against other specific targets, such as patient satisfaction, six sigma quality, customer retention and employee satisfaction; and third, individual performance measures for each executive officer. These criteria are applicable to all participants under the SMIP, including the Company's chief executive officer and its other executive officers.
          The additional targets established by the Compensation Committee for bonus awards for the chief executive officer and other executive officers for fiscal year 2006 are as follows:
          Under the SMIP, the maximum bonus that can be paid to a participant is 1% of the Company's Earnings (as defined in the SMIP) in the relevant fiscal year.
          Long-Term Incentives
          The chief executive officer and each other executive officer of the Company are eligible to receive annual long-term incentive awards in the form of stock options and performance shares under the ELTIP. On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee granted the stock options for fiscal year 2006 and the target performance shares for the fiscal year 2006 to 2008 performance period that are set out in the table below:
          Each stock option award is subject to the terms and conditions of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement entered into with the participant, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by this reference. The Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreements executed by the chief executive officer and each other executive officer of the Company with respect to the stock option grants in respect of 2006 also are filed as Exhibit 10.2 though Exhibit 10.7 to this report and are incorporated herein by this reference. The stock options granted in respect of 2006 will vest over a three-year period and have a seven-year term. All stock options are granted with an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of Company's common stock on the date of grant and option re-pricing is prohibited by the terms of the ELTIP, except if the Compensation Committee determines that one or more specified corporate transactions has affected the price per share such that an adjustment of outstanding awards is required to preserve (or prevent an enlargement of) the benefit or potential benefit intended at the time of the grant.
          Each performance share award is subject to the terms and conditions of a Performance Share Award Agreement entered into with the participant, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.8 to this report and is incorporated herein by this reference. The Performance Share Award Agreements executed by the chief executive officer and each other executive officer of the Company with respect to the performance shares awards in respect of 2006 also are filed as Exhibit 10.9 though Exhibit 10.14 to this report and are incorporated herein by this reference.
          The performance shares subject to the 2006 award will be earned based on the earnings per share performance of the Company over a multi-year period, and will be paid out in shares of common stock of the Company at the end of the term. The target performance shares issued in respect of 2006 provide for the issuance of stock based on the Company's earnings per share growth as compared to our peers in the compensation peer group. Depending upon the achieved "relative" earnings per share growth, 0% to 200% of the target number of shares may be awarded. Threshold awards equal to 0% of target will be earned when the Company's earnings per share ranks at the 25th percentile or below of the peer group. Target awards are earned for ranking at the 55th percentile of the peer group. Maximum awards equal to 200% of target will be earned when the Company's earnings per share growth ranks at the 85th percentile or above of the peer group. Awards for performance between these percentiles will be interpolated on a straight-line basis.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
