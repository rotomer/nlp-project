Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." On April 20, 2006, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
The following information is filed pursuant to "Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." On April 19, 2006, the Company decided to discontinue NID's operations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's test kit manufacturing subsidiary, NID, instituted its second voluntary product hold within a six-month period, due to quality issues, which has adversely impacted the operating performance of NID. As a result, the Company evaluated a number of strategic options for NID. The decision to discontinue NID's operations is expected to result in a pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 preliminarily estimated to be up to $45 million. The estimated charge is expected to principally relate to the write-off of operating assets and the accrual of liabilities associated with employee severance costs and various lease commitments. The associated cash expenditures are estimated to be up to $35 million.
Item 2.06. Material Impairment
The information included in Item 2.05 is hereby incorporated by reference into and filed pursuant to Item 2.06.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
LYNDHURST, N.J., APRIL 20, 2006Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, net income increased to $145 million from $132 million in the first quarter of 2005. Earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $0.72 from $0.64 a year ago. Included in the 2006 results were pretax special charges of $27 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily associated with integration activities; and a pretax gain of $16 million, or $0.05 per share, associated with the sale of an investment. The company's first quarter 2006 results include $19 million of pretax expenses, or $0.06 per share, associated with stock-based compensation recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
First quarter revenues grew 17.9% over the prior year level to $1.6 billion. The acquisition of LabOne, which was completed on November 1, 2005, increased consolidated revenues by approximately 10%. The performance at NID, the company's test kit manufacturing subsidiary, reduced consolidated revenue growth by approximately 1%. Clinical testing revenues grew 13.4%, with LabOne contributing approximately 5%. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.7% and revenue per requisition increased 4.3%.
For the first quarter, operating income was $245 million, or 15.7% of revenues, compared to $230 million, or 17.4% of revenues, in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1.7% due to special charges, 1.2% due to stock-based compensation (SFAS 123R), 0.8% due to the inclusion of LabOne and 0.7% due to the performance at NID.
Bad debt expense improved to 4.1% from 4.5% a year ago. Days sales outstanding were 43 days, compared to 46 days at the end of 2005. Cash flow from operations increased to $241 million from $136 million in 2005. During the quarter the company repurchased $104 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $42 million.
"We had an excellent first quarter," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are seeing strong top-line growth and margin expansion resulting from increased interest in new and innovative tests, and from our focus on enhancing the overall experience for patients and physicians. We continue to see opportunities to grow our business profitably, and have increased our outlook for 2006."
On April 19, 2006 the company decided to discontinue the operations of NID after evaluating a number of alternatives. This decision is expected to result in a second quarter pretax charge, preliminarily estimated to be up to $45 million.
Discontinuing NID Operations
For the full year 2006, revenues are now expected to grow approximately 14%. Operating income is expected to approximate 17% of revenues; cash from operations is expected to exceed $800 million; and capital expenditures are expected to be between $225 million and $245 million. The company raised its expectation for full year earnings per diluted share to between $2.85 and $2.95, from $2.75 to $2.85. These estimates exclude the impact of the anticipated second quarter charge related to discontinuing NID's operations.
