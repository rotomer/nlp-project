Exhibit 99.1
LYNDHURST, N.J., JULY 24, 2006Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, net income was $156 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, excluding the performance of NID, the company's test kit manufacturing subsidiary, whose operations are being discontinued. NID's performance reduced pretax earnings by $35 million, or $0.12 per share, and includes pretax charges of $28 million related to the wind down of NID's operations. Reported net income was $132 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2006, and included a pretax charge of $12 million, or $0.04 per share, associated with the write-down of an investment, and $20 million of pretax expenses, or $0.06 per share, associated with stock-based compensation recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R. For the second quarter of 2005, net income was $149 million, or $0.72 per diluted share.
Second quarter revenues grew 15% over the prior year level to $1.6 billion. The acquisition of LabOne, which was completed on November 1, 2005, increased consolidated revenues by approximately 10%. The performance of NID reduced consolidated revenue growth by approximately 1%. Clinical testing revenues grew 10.3%, with LabOne contributing almost 5%. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 5.7% and revenue per requisition increased 4.4%.
For the second quarter, operating income was $263 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $261 million, or 19.0% of revenues, in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1.6% due to NID's performance, 1.3% due to stock-based compensation (SFAS 123R) and 0.8% due to the inclusion of LabOne.
Bad debt expense was 3.8% compared to 4.3% a year ago. Days sales outstanding were 45 days. Cash flow from operations was $170 million compared to $234 million in 2005. During the quarter the company repurchased $150 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $46 million.
"We had strong performance in the second quarter," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We continued to deliver impressive revenue growth through a combination of organic and acquired growth. Organic growth, driven by innovative tests, and our focus on driving operational efficiencies, are improving profitability."
First Half Performance
For the first half of 2006 net income was $311 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, excluding the performance of NID, which reduced pretax earnings by $49 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Reported net income was $277 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, and included pretax charges of $27 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily associated with integration activities and $39 million of pretax expenses, or $0.12 per share, associated with stock-based compensation recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.

Operating income was $507 million, or 16.2% of revenues, in 2006 compared to $491 million, or 18.2% of revenues in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1.2% due to NID's performance, 1.3% due to stock-based compensation (SFAS 123R), 0.9% due to integration charges and 0.8% due to the inclusion of LabOne.
Cash from operations increased to $411 million from $371 million in 2005. During the first half of 2006, the company repurchased $254 million in common stock and made capital expenditures of $88 million.
Outlook for 2006
In anticipation of treating NID as a discontinued operation in 2006, guidance is presented excluding NID's performance. For the full year 2006 the company expects earnings per diluted share to be between $2.95 and $3.05, revenues to grow approximately 15% and operating income to approximate 17.5% of revenues. The company also expects cash from operations to approximate $850 million and capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million. For the full year 2006 the company expects NID's performance to generate pretax losses of $60 million to $68 million, or $0.20 to $0.23 per diluted share. A reconciliation from previous guidance to current guidance is included in Footnote 8 to the financial tables.
