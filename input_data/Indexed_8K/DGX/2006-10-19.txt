Net income for 2006 was reduced by $13 million of pretax expenses, or $0.04 per share, associated with stock-based compensation recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
 
Third quarter revenues from continuing operations grew 16.3% over the prior year level to $1.6 billion. The acquisition of LabOne, which was completed on November 1, 2005, increased revenues by 9.4%, and the acquisition of Focus Diagnostics, which was completed on July 1, 2006, added 1% to revenues. Clinical testing revenues grew 10.5%, with LabOne contributing 4.6%. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 4.9% and revenue per requisition increased 5.4%.
 
For the third quarter, operating income was $293 million, or 18.5% of revenues, compared to $250 million, or 18.4% of revenues, in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1% due to stock-based compensation (SFAS 123R) and approximately 1% due to the inclusion of LabOne.
 
Bad debt expense was 3.8% of revenues, compared to 4.3% a year ago. Days sales outstanding were 48 days. Cash flow from operations increased to $235 million compared to $178 million in 2005. During the quarter the company spent $230 million on acquisitions, repurchased $22 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $45 million.
 
"We had strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our focus on profitable growth and operational efficiencies," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter we completed two strategic acquisitions, Focus Diagnostics and Enterix, which are further differentiating us with proprietary new diagnostic tests and products in the areas of infectious disease and colorectal cancer."
 
During the quarter, the company completed the wind-down of NID, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary. The results of operations for NID have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented
.
Loss from discontinued operations was $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, the same as in the prior year.

For the first nine months of 2006 income from continuing operations was $474 million, or $2.37 per diluted share compared to $424 million, or $2.06 per diluted share in the prior year. Net income for 2006 included pretax charges of $27 million, or $0.08 per share, primarily associated with integration activities and $53 million of pretax expenses, or $0.16 per share, associated with stock-based compensation recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R.
 
Revenues from continuing operations increased 17.1% to $4.7 billion. The acquisition of LabOne increased revenues by approximately 10%. Operating income was $849 million, or 18.0% of revenues, in 2006
 
compared to $747 million, or 18.5% of revenues in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year was reduced by approximately 1% due to stock-based compensation (SFAS 123R), approximately 1% due to the inclusion of LabOne and 0.6% due to integration charges.
 
Cash from operations increased to $646 million from $548 million in 2005. During the first nine months of 2006, the company repurchased $276 million in common stock, spent $231 million on acquisitions, and made capital expenditures of $134 million.
 
Discontinued operations contributed a loss of $0.19 per diluted share for the first nine months, compared to a loss of $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year.
 
Outlook for 2006
For the full year 2006 the company expects results from continuing operations as follows: earnings per diluted share of between $3.05 and $3.10; revenues to grow approximately 15%; and operating income to approximate 17.5% of revenues. Over the same period, the company expects cash from operations to approximate $850 million and capital expenditures to be between $180 million and $200 million.

Notes to Financial Tables
 
 
 
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R totaled $13.5 million ($8.1 million, net of tax, or $0.04 per share) and $53 million ($32 million, net of tax, or $0.16 per share), respectively. In addition, in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, net cash provided by operating activities decreased and net cash provided by financing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 by $31 million, related to the classification of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), and related interpretations and chose to adopt the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148. Under this approach, the cost of restricted stock awards was expensed over their vesting period, while the imputed cost of stock option grants and discounts offered under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan was disclosed, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants, but not charged to expense. Stock-based compensation expense recorded in accordance with APB 25, relating to restricted stock awards, was $0.6 million and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. The following pro forma information is presented for comparative purposes and illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share for the periods presented, as if the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost associated with stock option awards and employee stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148 (in millions, except per share data):
 
 
The fair value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model that uses the assumptions in the following table. The expected volatility under the lattice-based option-valuation model was based on the current and the historical implied volatilities from traded options of the Company's stock. The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities ranging from one month to seven years. The expected life of the options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.
 
 
The fair value of restricted stock awards and performance share units is the average market price of our common stock at the date of grant.
 
 
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company finalized its plan related to the integration of Lab
One
, Inc. and recorded a charge of $20.7 million that primarily related to actions that impact Quest Diagnostics' employees and operations and was comprised principally of employee severance costs. In addition, during the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
 
7
 
$4.1 million charge related to consolidating its operations in California into a new facility. The costs were comprised primarily of employee severance costs and the write-off of certain operating assets.
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, other operating (income) expense, net includes a $6.2 million charge primarily related to forgiving amounts owed by patients and physicians, and related property damage as a result of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast.
 
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, other income (expense), net includes a $7.1 million charge associated with the write-down of an investment.
