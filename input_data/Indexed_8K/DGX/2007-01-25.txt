Notes to Financial Tables
The fair value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model that uses the assumptions in the following table. The expected volatility under the lattice-based option-valuation model was based on the current and the historical implied volatilities from traded options of the Company's stock. The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities ranging from one month to seven years. The expected life of the options granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.
The fair value of restricted stock awards and performance share units is the average market price of our common stock at the date of grant.
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R totaled $2.5 million ($1.5 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per share) and $55.5 million ($33.5 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per share), respectively. In addition, in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, net cash provided by operating activities decreased and net cash provided by financing activities increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 by $33 million, related to the classification of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), and related interpretations and chose to adopt the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148. Under this approach, the cost of restricted stock awards was expensed over their vesting period, while the imputed cost of stock option grants and discounts offered under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan was disclosed, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants, but not charged to expense. Stock-based compensation expense recorded in accordance with APB 25, relating to restricted stock awards, was $0.6 million and $2.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. The following pro forma information is presented for comparative purposes and illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share for the periods presented, as if the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost associated with stock option awards and employee stock purchases under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148 (in millions, except per share data):
