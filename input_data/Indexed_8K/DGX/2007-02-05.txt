Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On January 31, 2007, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (the "Company"), as Borrower, certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of Borrower, as Guarantors, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, entered into an Interim Credit Agreement ("Interim Credit Facility") for a $450 million senior unsecured loan. The Company is required, under the terms of the Interim Credit Facility, to use the proceeds from the Interim Credit Facility to acquire HemoCue, and to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. Under the Interim Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2008, interest is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin that will vary over an approximate range of 45 basis points based on changes in the Company's public debt rating. At its option, the Company may elect to enter into LIBOR-based interest rate contracts for periods up to six months. Interest on any outstanding amounts not covered under the LIBOR-based interest rate contracts is based on an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate or federal funds rate. The Interim Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company's domestic wholly owned operating subsidiaries. The Interim Credit Facility contains various covenants, which are the same covenants to which the Company is already subject to under its existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility and which include covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios, which could impact the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the Interim Credit Facility provides for the mandatory pre-payment of the loan in the event of a debt or equity issuance by the Company, subject to certain limited exceptions as set forth in the Interim Credit Agreement.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted, and all financial statements and certificates and reports as to financial matters required to be delivered to the Lenders hereunder shall be prepared, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. All calculations made for the purposes of determining compliance with this Credit Agreement shall (except as otherwise expressly provided herein) be made by application of GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the most recent annual or quarterly financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 (or, prior to the delivery of the first financial statements pursuant to Section 7.1, consistent with the financial statements delivered to the Lenders prior to the Closing Date);
provided
,
however
, if (a) the Borrower shall object to determining such compliance on such basis at the time of delivery of such financial statements due to
 
22
 
 
any change in GAAP or the rules promulgated with respect thereto or (b) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall so object in writing within 30 days after delivery of such financial statements, then such calculations shall be made on a basis consistent with GAAP as in effect as of the date of the most recent financial statements delivered by the Borrower to the Lenders to which no such objection shall have been made.
 
(b)
         
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of calculating the financial covenants set forth in Section 7.2, (i) income statement items (positive or negative) attributable to any Person or Property acquired in a Permitted Acquisition and Indebtedness incurred in connection with such Permitted Acquisition
shall, without duplication, be treated as if such Person or Property was acquired or such Indebtedness incurred as of the first day of the twelve month period ending as of the most recently completely fiscal quarter of the Borrower and (ii) income statement items (positive or negative) attributable to Property disposed of in any asset sale permitted by Section 8.5(g) and Indebtedness retired in connection with such sale shall, without duplication, be treated as if such sale occurred as of the first day of the twelve month period ending as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the Borrower.
 
 
All references to time herein shall be references to Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight time, as the case may be, unless specified otherwise.
 
 
Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).
 
 
Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (a) references to organization documents, agreements (including the Credit Documents) and other contractual instruments shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications thereto, but only to the extent that such amendments, restatements, extensions, supplements and other modifications are not prohibited by any Credit Document and (b) references to any law shall include all statutory and regulatory provisions (having the force of law) consolidating, amending, replacing, supplementing or interpreting such law.

SECTION 2
 
CREDIT FACILITIES
 
 
(a)
    
Loan Commitment
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, on the Closing Date, each Lender severally agrees to make interim loans (collectively the "
Interim Loans
" or "
Loans
") to the Borrower, in Dollars, in an amount equal to such Lender's Interim Loan Commitment Percentage of the Interim Loan Committed Amount;
provided
that the aggregate amount of such Interim Loans made shall not exceed the Interim Loan Committed Amount. Once repaid or prepaid, Interim Loans cannot be reborrowed.
 
(b)
   
Funding of Loans
. Each Lender shall make its Interim Loan Commitment Percentage of the Interim Loan Committed Amount available to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the Closing Date by deposit, in Dollars, of immediately available funds at the Agency Services Address. The amount of the Interim Loans will then be made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent as directed by the Borrower, to the extent the amount of such Interim Loans are made available to the Administrative Agent. All Interim Loans made on the Closing Date shall be Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower delivers a funding indemnity letter in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Thereafter, all or any portion of the Interim Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2.
 
The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Interim Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.7 are several and not joint. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make Interim Loans hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any such Interim Loan that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Interim Loans to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Interim Loans, and the Administrative Agent in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion but without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent
 
24
 
 
at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the Base Rate or (ii) from such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but excluding the date two Business Days after demand therefor, the Federal Funds Rate, and, thereafter, the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum.
 
(c)
    
Interim Notes
. The Interim Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to each Lender that requests an Interim Note in substantially the form of
Exhibit 2.1(c)
.
 
 
Subject to the terms below, the Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to continue existing Eurodollar Loans for a subsequent Interest Period, to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans or to convert Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans. By no later than 11:00 a.m. (a) on the date of the requested conversion of a Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan or (b) three Business Days prior to the date of the requested continuation of a Eurodollar Loan or conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, the Borrower shall provide telephonic notice to the Administrative Agent, followed promptly by a written Notice of Continuation/Conversion, in the form of
Exhibit 2.2
setting forth (i) whether the Borrower wishes to continue or convert such Loans and (ii) if the request is to continue a Eurodollar Loan or convert a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period applicable thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) except as provided in Section 3.11, Eurodollar Loans may only be continued or converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (B) Eurodollar Loans may not be continued nor may Base Rate Loans be converted into Eurodollar Loans during the existence and continuation of a Default or an Event of Default, (C) any request to continue a Eurodollar Loan that fails to comply with the terms hereof or any failure to request a continuation of a Eurodollar Loan at the end of an Interest Period shall constitute a conversion to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the applicable Interest Period and (D) any failure to state the Interest Period with respect to the continuation of a Eurodollar Loan or the conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan shall constitute a request for a one month Interest Period.
 
 
Each request for a conversion or continuation shall be subject to the requirements that (a) each Eurodollar Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (b) each Base Rate Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof). For the purposes of this Section 2.3, all Eurodollar Loans with the same Interest Periods that begin and end on the same date shall be considered as one Eurodollar Loan, but Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods, even if they begin on the same date, shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans.

SECTION 3
 
GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS
 
 
 
(a)
    
Interest Rate
. Subject to Section 3.1(b), (i) all Base Rate Loans shall accrue interest at the Base Rate and (ii) all Eurodollar Loans shall accrue interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.
 
(b)
   
Default Rate of Interest
. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuation, of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 9.1(a), the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including without limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate equal to 2% plus the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, then the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum).
 
(c)
    
Interest Payments
. Interest on Loans shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.
 
 
All payments of principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts to be made by a Credit Party under this Credit Agreement shall be made unconditionally and without any setoff, deduction, counterclaim, defense, recoupment or withholding of any kind and received not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date when due, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, by the Administrative Agent at the Agency Services Address. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent the Loans, fees or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to Section 3.7, distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem appropriate). The Administrative Agent will distribute such payments to the Lenders on the same Business Day if any such payment is received at or before 2:00 p.m.; otherwise the Administrative Agent will distribute such payment to the Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period of such extension), except that, in the case of Eurodollar Loans (or interest payable with respect thereto), if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day.
 
 
(a)
    
Voluntary Prepayments
. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time without premium or penalty;
provided
,
however
, that
 
26
 
 
(i) Eurodollar Loans may only be prepaid on three Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and (ii) each such partial prepayment of Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans shall be in the minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000. Amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect;
however
, if the Borrower fails to specify, such prepayment will be applied in the manner set forth in Section 3.3(c) below.
 
(b)
         
Mandatory Prepayments
. Within five (5) Business Days following receipt by a Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries of proceeds from a Debt Issuance or an Equity Issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the proceeds of such Debt Issuance or Equity Issuance (net of actual transaction costs paid to third parties in connection therewith). All such prepayments hereunder shall be applied as set forth in Section 3.3(c) below.
 
(c)
    
Application of Prepayments
. All amounts paid pursuant to Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(c) shall be subject to Section 3.14.
 
 
 
On the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal balance of all Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other sums owing with respect thereto, shall be due and payable in full, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.
 
 
(a)
    
Except for Base Rate Loans that are based upon the Prime Rate, in which case interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing (or continuation or conversion) but exclude the date of payment.
 
(b)
   
It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the
 
27
 
 
maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to accelerate the payment of any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such Indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.
 
 
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, each Interim Loan borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Interim Loan, each payment of fees (other than the fees retained by the Administrative Agent for its own account) and each conversion or continuation of any Interim Loan shall (except as otherwise provided in Section 3.11) be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders in accordance with the respective Interim Loan Commitment Percentages of such Lenders, as applicable, (or, if the Commitments of such Lenders have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the outstanding Interim Loans and Participation Interests of such Lenders);
provided
that, if any Lender shall have failed to pay its applicable pro rata share of any Interim Loan, then any amount to which such Lender would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall instead be payable to the Administrative Agent until the share of such Loan not funded by such Lender has been repaid;
provided
further
, that in the event any amount paid to any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.7 is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter, the Base Rate
plus
two percent (2%) per annum.
 
 
The Lenders agree among themselves that, except to the extent otherwise provided herein, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien or
 
28
 
 
counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly pay in cash or purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by payment in cash or a repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall fail to remit to any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent to such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
 
 
(a)
         
If, after the date thereof, any Lender determines that the introduction after the Closing Date of any law, rule or regulation or other Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital or assets of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
 
(b)
         
The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States of America to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan
 
29
 
 
equal to (i) (A) the applicable Eurodollar Rate divided by (B) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage
minus
(ii) the applicable Eurodollar Rate. Such additional interest shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan;
provided
the Borrower shall have received at least five days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice five days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable five days from the receipt by the Borrower of such notice.
 
 
If the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all the Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion with respect to Eurodollar Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion into a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.
 
 
If any Lender determines that any Requirement of Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore Dollar market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any amounts due with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.14. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
 
30
 
 
 
 
If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any Requirement of Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.13 shall govern) and (ii) reserve requirements utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate), then from time to time, within 10 days of demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in yield.
 
 
(a)
         
Any and all payments by a Credit Party to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Credit Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future income, stamp or other taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, but excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, any branch profit taxes or taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes), by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains its Lending Office (all such non-excluded present or future income, stamp or other taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
"). If a Credit Party shall be required by any Requirement of Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.13(a)), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such Credit Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, to the extent such receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)
        
In addition, each Credit Party agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Credit Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
").
 
31
 
 
 
(c)
         
If a Credit Party shall be required to deduct or pay any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Credit Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, such Credit Party shall also pay to the Administrative Agent (for the account of such Lender) or to such Lender, at the time interest is paid, such additional amount that such Lender reasonably specifies by written notice to such Credit Party as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed;
provided
that if such Lender fails to provide such notice to such Credit Party before the date which is five days prior to the date such interest is paid, such Credit Party shall pay at the time such interest is paid such amount as such Credit Party reasonably estimates will preserve such Lender's after-tax yield (after factoring in only such Taxes or Other Taxes) and pay the balance within five days after receiving such notice.
 
(d)
          
Each Credit Party agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.13(d)) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender and (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest and reasonable expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
 
(e)
          
In the case of any payment hereunder or under any other Credit Document by or on behalf of a Credit Party through an account or branch outside the United States, or on behalf of a Credit Party by a payor that is not a United States person, if such Credit Party determines that no taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Credit Party shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Administrative Agent, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (e), the terms "
United States
" and "
United States person
" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Code.
 
(f)
     
Each Lender that is a foreign corporation, foreign partnership or foreign trust within the meaning of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code, two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto (relating to such Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Lender by the Credit Parties pursuant to this Credit Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Lender by a Credit Party pursuant to this Credit Agreement), as appropriate, or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Lender that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9 or any successor thereto or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of,
 
32
 
 
United States withholding tax. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Lender shall (i) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities), as appropriate, as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement, (ii) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction (or it is determined the earlier claimed exemption was incorrectly claimed for any reason) and (iii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any Requirement of Law that the Credit Parties make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. If the forms or other evidence provided by such Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Credit Agreement indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes for purpose of any indemnity or gross up unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; provided, however, that, if at the date of any assignment pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this Credit Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 3.13 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If such Lender fails to deliver the above forms or other evidence, then the Borrower or the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equal to the applicable withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold any tax or other amount from payments made in respect of such Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Borrower or the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent under this Section 3.13(f), and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to provide the Administrative Agent with the above forms or other evidence (other than if such failure is due to a change in the applicable law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring after the date on which such form or other evidence originally was required to be provided or if such form or other evidence otherwise is not required), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection (d) of this Section 3.13 nor shall the Credit Party be required to deduct or withhold under subsections (a) or (c) of this Section 3.13 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a

Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver such form or other evidence required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender in recovering such Taxes. The obligation of the Lenders under this Section 3.13(f) shall survive the payment of all Credit Party Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
 
(g)
    
In the event that an additional payment is made under Section 3.13(a) or (c) for the account of any Lender and such Lender, in its reasonable judgment, determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been granted a credit against or release or remission for, or repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such Lender shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender shall, in its reasonable judgment, have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and which will leave such Lender (after such payment) in no worse position than it would have been in if the Borrower had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.
 
 
Upon the written demand of any Lender, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
 
(a)
          
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise); or
 
(b)
         
any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Eurodollar Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Loan on the date or in the amount previously requested by the Borrower.
 
The amount each such Lender shall be compensated pursuant to this Section 3.14 shall include, without limitation, (i) any loss incurred by such Lender in connection with the re-employment of funds prepaid, repaid, not borrowed or paid, as the case may be and (ii) any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred and reasonably attributable thereto.
 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.14, each Lender may deem that it funded each Eurodollar Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate
for such Eurodollar Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable
 
34
 
 
offshore Dollar interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded.
 
 
All determinations by the Administrative Agent or a Lender of amounts owing under Sections 3.9 through 3.14, inclusive, shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 3.9 through 3.14, inclusive, shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of all Credit Party Obligations.
 
 
Subject to Section 3.13(c), each Lender shall notify the Borrower (and any applicable Credit Party) of any event that will entitle such Lender to compensation under Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof;
provided
,
however
, that if any Lender fails to give such notice within 90 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Lender shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 for costs incurred from and after the date 90 days prior to the date that such Lender gives such notice. If requested by the Borrower, each Lender will furnish to Borrower within ten Business Days of the time the Lender requests compensation under Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14, a certificate setting forth the basis, amount and reasonable detail of computation of each request by such Lender for compensation under Section 3.9, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14, which certificate shall, except for demonstrable error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.
 
 
Each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate any increased cost or suspension of the availability of an interest rate under Sections 3.9 through 3.14 above to the greatest extent practicable (including transferring the Loans to another Lending Office or Affiliate of a Lender) unless, in the reasonable opinion of such Lender, such efforts would be likely to have an adverse effect upon it. In the event a Lender makes a request to the Borrower for additional payments in accordance with Section 3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14, then,
provided
that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, the Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense to include, without limitation, any transfer fee payable to the Administrative Agent under Section 11.3(b)) and in its sole discretion, require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.3(b)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (a) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority and (b) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by such assigning Lender and all other
 
35
 
 
amounts owed to such assigning Lender hereunder, including amounts owed pursuant to Sections 3.9 through 3.14 hereof.

The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
 
37
 
 
Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.
 
 
The Guarantors agree that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 9) notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing such Credit Party Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or such Credit Party Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors.
 
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of any Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state or otherwise and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).
 
 
The Credit Parties agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Credit Party shall have contribution rights against the other Credit Parties as permitted under applicable law. Such contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of the Credit Parties under the Credit Documents and no Credit Party shall exercise such rights of contribution until all Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full.
 
 
Subject to Section 7.12(b), if any of the Guarantors shall cease to be a Material Domestic Subsidiary of the Borrower for any reason subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, then such Guarantor shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of any party to any Credit Document, and upon notice to the Administrative Agent, be fully released and discharged from all its liabilities and obligations under or in respect of the Credit Documents to which such Guarantor is a party (other than liabilities and obligations resulting from a demand on such Guarantor's Guaranty pursuant to Section 9.2) and, promptly upon the request of the Borrower and at the expense of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall execute such documents and take such other action as is reasonably requested by the Borrower to

provided
,
however
, that a Credit Party shall not be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy, claim or Indebtedness which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which adequate reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless the failure to make any such payment (i) would give rise to an immediate right to foreclose or collect on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
 
The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain in full force and effect insurance (including worker's compensation, liability, casualty and business interruption insurance) with reputable national companies that are not Affiliates of the Borrower (except to the extent that self-insurance is maintained in reasonable amounts), in such amounts, covering such risks and liabilities as is reasonable and prudent.

Any representatives appointed by the Administrative Agent shall sign a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Borrower prior to any visit, investigation, inspection or verification permitted by this Section 7.11.

(a)
    
Acceleration of Loans
. Declare the unpaid principal of and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans and any and all other Indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind owing by a Credit Party to any of the Lenders under the Credit Documents to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.
 
(b)
   
Enforcement of Rights
. To the extent permitted by law, enforce any and all rights and interests created and existing under the Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of set-off.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section 9.1(f) shall occur, then all Loans, all accrued interest in respect thereof, all accrued and unpaid fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing to the Lenders hereunder shall immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or other action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, which notice or other action is expressly waived by the Credit Parties.
 
Notwithstanding the fact that enforcement powers reside primarily with the Administrative Agent, each Lender has, to the extent permitted by law, a separate right of payment and shall be considered a separate "creditor" holding a separate "claim" within the meaning of Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other insolvency statute.
 
 
62
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement, after the exercise of any remedies by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.2 (or after any Event of Default that causes all of the Credit Party Obligations to be due hereunder), all amounts collected or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or delivered as follows:
 
FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable Attorney Costs) of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit Documents, pro rata as set forth below;
 
SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, pro rata as set forth below;

SIXTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.
 
In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category and (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Loans of amounts available to be applied).
 
SECTION 10
 
AGENCY PROVISIONS
 
 
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
 
63
 
 
delegated to it by the terms of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary or trustee relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Credit Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
 
 
The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care.
 
 
No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein) or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Credit Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for any failure of any Credit Party or any other party to any Credit Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.
 
 
(a)
          
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be
 
64
 
 
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Credit Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Lender as the owner of its interests hereunder for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 11.3(b). The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and participants, and their respective successors and assigns. Where this Credit Agreement expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the Required Lenders otherwise determine, the Administrative Agent shall, and in all other instances, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or a vote of the Lenders.
 
(b)
          
For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender.
 
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9.2;
provided
,
however
, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.
 
 
 
65
 
 
 
Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their respective Affiliates, and all applicable bank or other regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, Property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, Property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.
 
 
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it;
provided
,
however
, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Agent-Related Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; it being understood that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section 10.7. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Credit Parties. The undertaking in this Section 10.7 shall survive termination of the
 
66
 
 
Commitments, the payment of all Credit Party Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
 
 
Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Credit Party or such Affiliate) and that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.
 
 
The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders which successor administrative agent (such appointment, absent the existence of an Event of Default, to be subject to the consent of the Borrower, which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 and Sections 11.5 and 11.10 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.
 
 
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the
 
67
 
 
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)
          
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Credit Party Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)
          
to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Credit Party Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Special Purpose Entities

Granting Lender
") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "
SPC
") the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Credit Agreement;
provided

Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Credit Agreement, any SPC may disclose any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC so long as such disclosure is clearly designated as being made on a confidential basis. This Section 11.3(g) may not be amended without the prior written consent of each Granting Lender, all or any part of whose Loan is being funded by an SPC at the time of such amendment.

No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any Credit Party and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
 
 
(i)
           
any and all attorneys' fees and disbursements and out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the development, drafting, negotiation and administration of the Credit Documents,

75
 
 
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Credit Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages relating to this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date).

release the Borrower from its obligations or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under (or in respect of) the
 
76

Press Release
 
Quest Diagnostics Acquires HemoCue For Approximately $420 Million,
Entering Market for Near Patient Testing
 
LYNDHURST, N.J., February 1, 2007 
Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the leading U.S. provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced today that it has acquired HemoCue, a Swedish company specializing in near patient testing, also known as point-of-care testing, from the private equity firm EQT II B.V. in a cash transaction valued at approximately $420 million. The acquisition will allow Quest Diagnostics to enter the growing near patient testing market and leverage HemoCue's international presence to reach new markets around the world. The transaction, which has been financed through a new credit facility, is not expected to have a material impact on Quest Diagnostics' 2007 financial results. Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
 
HemoCue has annualized revenues of approximately $90 million and is the leading international provider in near patient testing for hemoglobin, with a growing share in professional glucose and microalbumin testing. The company's handheld systems are used in physicians' offices, blood banks, hospitals, diabetes clinics, and public health clinics. In developing countries these systems are used as the primary means to screen for anemia. The measurement of hemoglobin is important for patients being treated by transfusion, or undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy, where instant test results can lead to immediate treatment decisions.
 
HemoCue has a strong product pipeline, based on the pioneering use of its patented microfluidic systems, and is currently developing new tests including a near patient test to determine white blood cell counts. This test will help physicians quickly determine the presence of an infection and, consequently, the need for antibiotic treatment, potentially reducing the overuse of antibiotics, an ongoing public health concern. This acquisition also complements efforts underway at Quest Diagnostics in near patient testing for infectious disease and cancer, including new tests for colorectal cancer screening and herpes simplex virus type 2.
 
In addition, Quest Diagnostics intends to enhance the electronic connectivity of HemoCue's handheld systems by making them compatible with its Care360 portal, which enables doctors to store, access and share patient information. The Care360 portal provides physicians with 24/7 access to lab and medication records, patient medical history and remote ordering of lab testing or e-prescribing.
 
"Technology is enabling diagnostic testing to move closer to the patient, and the acquisition of HemoCue and its exciting product pipeline gives us a strong presence in this emerging market," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics. "Linking near patient testing devices to our proprietary Care360 patient-centric physician portal can provide longitudinal test reporting on a patient regardless of how or where a test was performed. This will help doctors improve the way they diagnose, monitor and treat disease."
 
"We look forward to bringing together two organizations that share a passion for patient care, quality, service and innovation," said HemoCue Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Josef Selinger who will continue to operate HemoCue as part of Quest Diagnostics.
