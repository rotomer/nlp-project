LYNDHURST, N.J., JULY 24, 2007Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007, income from continuing operations was $142 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to $156 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter of 2007 includes the results of AmeriPath, Inc., which was acquired on May 31, 2007. Second quarter 2006 results include a charge of $0.04 per share associated with the write-down of an investment.
Second quarter revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3.7% compared to the prior-year level. The acquisition of AmeriPath increased consolidated revenues by 4.4% . Clinical testing revenues increased by 2.1% . Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 6.0%, and revenue per requisition increased 8.6% . The acquisition of AmeriPath increased clinical testing volume by 1.8% and revenue per requisition by 3.1% . The change in status with UnitedHealthcare reduced consolidated revenues by approximately 4.4% and testing volume by approximately 7%.
"We made significant progress in the second quarter, and our business is getting stronger. We renewed a number of important managed care agreements, improved the efficiency of our operations, and acquired AmeriPath, becoming the premier cancer diagnostics company," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Additionally, we have identified opportunities to further reduce costs by $500 million over the next two years, which will allow us to continue to expand margins and invest in growth in a highly competitive environment."
For the second quarter, operating income was $272 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $297 million, or 18.8% of revenues in 2006. This reflects a significant improvement from the first quarter of 2007 in which operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13.2% . This improvement was principally a result of actions taken to reduce costs, and higher revenue per requisition.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.3% of revenues, compared to 4.4% in the first quarter. Days sales outstanding were 51 days, compared to 47 days at the end of the first quarter. The acquisition of AmeriPath increased bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues by 0.3% and days sales outstanding by 4 days. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and was reduced by $57 million of fees and other expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of AmeriPath. This compares to $170 million in 2006. During the quarter, the company made capital expenditures of $49 million.
First Half Performance
For the first six months of 2007, income from continuing operations was $249 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $311 million, or $1.55 per diluted share in the first half of 2006. Revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of 1.0% compared to the prior-year level. The acquisition of AmeriPath increased consolidated revenues by 2.2% . The change in status with UnitedHealthcare reduced consolidated revenues by approximately 4.6% .
Operating income for the first half was $473 million, or 14.9% of revenues, compared to $556 million, or 17.7% of revenues in 2006. The decrease was principally due to the change in status with UnitedHealthcare. Cash from operations was $280 million compared to $411 million in 2006. During the first half of 2007, the company repurchased $105 million of its common stock and made capital expenditures of $89 million.
Outlook for 2007
For the full year 2007 the company currently expects results from continuing operations as follows: adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $2.80 and $2.95; revenues of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, with nearly $500 million from AmeriPath; and operating income of approximately 16% of revenues. Over the same period, the company expects cash from operations to approximate $800 million and capital expenditures of between $210 million and $220 million. These estimates exclude $0.04 per share in total first quarter charges associated with workforce reductions and the expense of in-process research and development, and are before charges related to potential additional restructuring activities.
