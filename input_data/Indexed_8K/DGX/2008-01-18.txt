The company is rescheduling its report of fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results in order to provide time to attempt to make further progress in its ongoing effort to settle with the government claims associated with the government's investigation in connection with NID, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary the company closed in 2006. While the company is working diligently to reach such a settlement prior to its report of earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, there can be no assurance as to when or whether a settlement may be reached, or as to its terms.
