Agreement in Principle Regarding Previously Disclosed NID-Related Matter
The company and NID, the company's former test-kit manufacturing subsidiary, reached an agreement in principle with the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York to settle the previously disclosed federal government investigation. The agreement in principle provides for a comprehensive settlement of federal claims. NID, which was closed in 2006, is expected to enter a guilty plea to a single count of felony misbranding. The terms of the settlement are subject to the final negotiation and execution of definitive agreements.
As a result of the agreement in principle, during the third quarter, the company recorded a charge of $73 million in discontinued operations to increase its reserves for the settlement and related matters, bringing the total reserve for these matters to $314 million, the company's best estimate of the expected probable loss. The company reported a loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of $49 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the quarter. See footnote 6 to the attached tables.
Outlook for 2008
For the full year 2008, the company now expects results from continuing operations as follows: adjusted earnings per diluted share of between $3.17 and $3.22, compared to the previous range of $3.10 to $3.20; revenue growth of greater than 8%, and operating income to approach 17% of revenues. Over the same period, the company expects cash from operations to approximate $900 million and capital expenditures of between $200 million and $220 million. These estimates exclude the third quarter impact of an equity investment write-down and hurricanes, and potential special charges.
