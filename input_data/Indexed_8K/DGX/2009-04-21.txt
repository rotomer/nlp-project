MADISON, N.J., APRIL 21, 2009Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, income from continuing operations was $169 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $141 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.
First quarter revenues increased 1.3% to $1.8 billion. Clinical testing revenues increased 2.2% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition increased 4.1% and clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 1.9%. Drugs of abuse testing volume, which is sensitive to hiring trends, declined 25% and reduced clinical testing volume by 1.7% . Changes associated with lab management agreements that the company exited further reduced volume by about 1%. Underlying volume continued to grow consistent with prior quarters.
"We began the year with a strong first quarter, delivering a 24% increase in earnings per share," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect our continued focus on growing esoteric testing, including cancer diagnostics, and our program to drive sustainable operating efficiencies, as well as effective cost management in the quarter. We are executing our plan, and for 2009 continue to expect revenue growth of 3%. Reflecting our strong performance in the quarter, today we are raising our guidance for earnings per share."
For the first quarter, operating income increased to $321 million, or 17.8% of revenues, from $280 million, or 15.7% of revenues in 2008. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved to 4.5% from 4.8% in the prior year. Days sales outstanding improved to 43 days, compared to 48 days a year ago and 44 days at year end. Cash flow from operations improved to $273 million, from $158 million in the first quarter of 2008. During the quarter, the company repurchased $250 million of its common shares and made capital expenditures of $40 million.
Earnings Outlook for 2009 Improved
For 2009, the company today increased its estimated earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to between $3.65 and $3.75, which includes an anticipated second-quarter benefit of $0.05 per share associated with an insurance recovery. Previously, the company estimated diluted earnings per share of between $3.50 and $3.70. The company expects revenue growth of approximately 3% and operating income of approximately 18% of revenues.

Estimated cash from operations before the payment of the previously announced NID settlement is presented because management believes that it is a useful adjunct to estimated cash from operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of the company's ongoing operating performance. Estimated cash from operations before the payment of the previously announced NID settlement is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to estimated cash from operations.
