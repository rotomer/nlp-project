Changes associated with hospital lab management agreements that the company exited further reduced consolidated volume by about 0.7%.

Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Quest Diagnostics growth is being driven by increased demand in testing for cancer, sexually transmitted diseases and allergies. In addition, we added several important new tests during the quarter that will help drive future growth. Based on the strong performance in the first half, we are raising earnings guidance for the full year.

Estimated cash from operations before the payment of the previously announced NID settlement is presented because management believes that it is a useful adjunct to estimated cash from operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of the company's ongoing operating performance. Estimated cash from operations before the payment of the previously announced NID settlement is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to estimated cash from operations.
