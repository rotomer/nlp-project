Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 20, 2009, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated issued a press release announcing, among other things, its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
MADISON, N.J., DATE October 20, 2009Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009, income from continuing operations rose to $192 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, from $160 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2008. In 2008, third quarter results were reduced by a $0.03 per share charge associated with the write-down of an equity investment, and a $0.02 per share impact associated with hurricanes.
Third quarter revenues increased 3.9% to $1.9 billion compared to the prior year. Clinical testing revenues increased by 4.3% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition increased 4.3%. Underlying volume in clinical testing, measured by the number of requisitions, continued to grow in the quarter. Reported testing volume was unchanged from the prior year and reflected a 23% decline in drugs-of-abuse testing volume, which is sensitive to hiring trends, and which reduced the company's consolidated volume by 1.7%. In the third quarter of 2008, consolidated revenues and volume were reduced by approximately half a percent as a result of the impact of hurricanes.
"Quest Diagnostics' strong financial performance continues to be driven by increased demand in testing for cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, allergies and Vitamin D levels. Based on our strong performance, we are raising earnings guidance for the full year," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our continued focus on innovation is driving growth today and positioning Quest Diagnostics well for the future. We recently introduced the first commercial test for the H1N1 flu virus authorized by the FDA for emergency use, and launched a saliva-based genetic test that helps physicians predict response to the blood thinner Plavix."
For the third quarter, operating income increased to $348 million, or 18.4% of revenues, compared to $317 million, or 17.4% of revenues, for the third quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, operating income as a percentage of revenues was reduced by approximately half a percent as a result of the impact of hurricanes.
For the third quarter, bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 4.4%, unchanged from the second quarter and the prior year. Days sales outstanding of 43 days were unchanged from the second quarter and improved by two days from the prior year period. Cash flow from operations improved to $374 million compared to $329 million for 2008. During the quarter, the company repurchased $100 million of its common shares and made capital expenditures of $41 million.
Year-to-Date Performance
For the first nine months of 2009, income from continuing operations increased to $549 million, or $2.91 per diluted share, from $463 million, or $2.35 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2008. Revenues increased 2.9% to $5.6 billion.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2009 increased to $1.0 billion, or 18.3% of revenues, compared to $905 million, or 16.6% of revenues for 2008. Cash from operations, which was reduced by the $308 million payment in the second quarter related to the previously announced NID settlement, was $637 million. In the first nine months of 2008, cash from operations was $700 million. During the first nine months of 2009, the company repurchased $350 million of its common shares, and made capital expenditures of $117 million.
Outlook for the Full-Year 2009
For the full-year 2009, the company today increased its estimated earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to a range of $3.80 to $3.85. Previously, the company estimated diluted earnings per share of between $3.70 and $3.80. The company expects revenue growth of approximately 3% and operating income to exceed 18% of revenues. Cash from operations is expected to approximate $1.2 billion before the payment of the previously announced NID settlement, or $900 million after such payment. Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $180 million.
