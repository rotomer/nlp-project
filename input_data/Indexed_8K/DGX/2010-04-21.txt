MADISON, N.J., APRIL 21, 2010Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced that for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, income from continuing operations was $163 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $169 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009. Earnings comparisons were impacted by a 2010 first quarter charge of $0.06 per share principally associated with workforce reductions, and $0.05 due to the estimated impact of severe weather.
First quarter revenues were $1.8 billion, unchanged from the 2009 level. Clinical testing revenues decreased 0.4% compared to the prior year. Revenue per requisition increased 2.3% and clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 2.6% . Severe weather is estimated to have reduced growth in clinical testing revenues and volume by 1%.
"Our business remains strong, despite being negatively impacted by severe weather and softness in the marketplace," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We saw continued growth in gene-based and esoteric testing, and generated strong cash from operations. In addition, we are taking actions to accelerate growth and further manage our costs. After adjusting for the first quarter weather and charge, our full-year EPS guidance remains unchanged."
For the first quarter, operating income was $299 million, or 16.5% of revenues, compared to $321 million, or 17.8% of revenues, in 2009. The charge associated with workforce reductions and the estimated impact of severe weather reduced the year-over-year change in operating income as a percentage of revenues by 1.6% . Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues improved to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior year. Days sales outstanding improved to 41 days, compared to 43 days a year ago. Cash flow from operations was $239 million, compared to $273 million in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, the company repurchased $251 million of its common shares and made capital expenditures of $40 million.
Earnings Outlook for 2010 Updated
For 2010, the company today updated its full year 2010 guidance. Full year earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, adjusted for the impact of special charges and weather in the first quarter, are unchanged at between $4.10 and $4.30. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $4.00 and $4.20. The company expects revenue growth of between 1% and 2%.

Risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of the company include, but are not limited to, adverse results from pending or future government investigations, lawsuits or private actions, the competitive environment, changes in government regulations, changing relationships with customers, payers, suppliers and strategic partners and other factors discussed in "Business," "Risk Factors," "Cautionary Factors that May Affect Future Results," "Legal Proceedings," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the company's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other items throughout the Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
Estimated adjusted diluted earnings per common share is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to estimated diluted earnings per common share and other measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance and is on a basis consistent with previous estimates of diluted earnings per common share. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to estimated diluted earnings per common share.
