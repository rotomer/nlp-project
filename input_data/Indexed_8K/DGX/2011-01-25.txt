Fourth quarter 2010 results include charges associated with workforce reductions ($0.03 per share) and the settlement of employment litigation ($0.03 per share), which were partially offset by a benefit of $0.05 per share primarily associated with the favorable resolution of tax contingencies.
Fourth quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were 1.3% below the prior year level. Clinical testing revenues were 1.4% below the prior year. Revenue per requisition was 1.5% below the prior year, and in line with the last two quarters. Clinical testing volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was 0.1% above the prior year level.
"We generated strong cash flow in the quarter, and were encouraged by the continued improvement in our volume trends and the stability in revenue per requisition," said Surya N. Mohapatra, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have taken actions to strengthen our sales organization, expand our pipeline of new tests and services, and improve our operating efficiency, which position us for revenue and EPS growth."
For the fourth quarter, operating income was $294 million, or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $330 million, or 17.9% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2009. The 2010 fourth-quarter charges reduced operating income as a percentage of revenues by approximately 1.0%. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues was 3.8%, compared to 3.9% in the prior year. Days sales outstanding were 44 days. Cash flow from operations was $340 million compared to $360 million for 2009. During the quarter, the company made capital expenditures of $69 million.

Income from continuing operations was $723 million, or $4.06 per diluted share, compared to $730 million, or $3.88 per diluted share, for 2009. Revenues of $7.4 billion were 1.2% below the prior year level.
