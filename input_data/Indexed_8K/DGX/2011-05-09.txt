Quest Diagnostics Reaches Agreement in Principle to Settle
California Lawsuit Related to Medi-Cal Billing
 
-- Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX) today announced it has reached an agreement in principle to settle a previously disclosed civil lawsuit, brought by a California competitor, in which the State of California intervened. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the company did not comply with Californias comparable charge regulations, resulting in overpayments for laboratory testing services by Medi-Cal, Californias Medicaid program.
Madison, NJ, May 09, 2011
pay $241 million to resolve the comparable charge allegations.
As part of the agreement in principle, the company has agreed to
The company also has agreed to reporting obligations regarding its pricing for a limited time period and, in lieu of such obligations for a transitional period, to provide Medi-Cal with a discount until the end of July 2012. The company will also be provided with a full release of all the claims alleged in the lawsuit. The agreement in principle is subject to certain approvals by the State of California and final approval by the companys Board of Directors. In the event that a settlement is not finalized, the company will continue to vigorously defend itself in the pending litigation and could incur significant costs in doing so.
As a result of the agreement in principle, Quest Diagnostics has recorded a pre-tax charge of $236 million, $195 million after tax or $1.19 per share. Due to the timing of the agreement in principle, this charge is reflected in first-quarter 2011 results and, accordingly, updates results previously disclosed on April 20, 2011.
 
First-quarter 2011 adjusted income from continuing operations is $164 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, unchanged from the amount disclosed on April 20, 2011. Adjusted results exclude the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, charges for workforce reductions, and costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions. The Medi-Cal charge reduces previously reported income from continuing operations by $195 million or $1.19 per share, resulting in a loss of $53 million and a loss of $0.33 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations was previously reported as $141 million or $0.86 per diluted share.
Adjusted operating income is $301 million, or 16.3% of revenues, for the first quarter 2011,unchanged from the amounts disclosed on April 20, 2011. The Medi-Cal charge reduces previously reported operating income by $236 million and operating income as a percentage of revenues by 13.0%, to $31 million, or 1.7%, respectively. Operating income for the first quarter was previously reported as $267 million, or 14.7% of revenues.
 
Outlook for 2011
The company has updated its guidance from continuing operations to reflect the impact of the Medi-Cal charge. For the full-year 2011, the company now expects results from continuing operations, before future special items, as follows:
 
       
Revenue to grow approximately 2%, unchanged from previous guidance.
       
Earnings per diluted share to remain between $4.25 and $4.45 on an adjusted basis and to be between $2.92 and $3.12 on a reported basis;
       
Operating income as a percentage of revenues to remain between 17.5% and 18.0% on an adjusted basis and to be between 14.0% and 14.5% on a reported basis;
       
Cash from operations of approximately $900 million, compared to previous guidance of approximately $1.1 billion, after reflecting the anticipated after-tax impact of the Medi-Cal charge; and
       
Capital expenditures to approximate $220 million.
 
The outlook on an adjusted basis excludes the first-quarter impact of the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, charges for workforce reductions, and costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions. The outlook does not reflect the impact of the Celera acquisition and will be updated after completion of the merger.
 
Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As used in this press release, the term adjusted refers to the operating performance measures that exclude the impact of the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, charges associated with workforce reductions, and costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
1) Adjusted amounts for operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues, income from continuing operations, and diluted earnings per common share represent the Companys results before the impact of the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, restructuring charges and transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Athena Diagnostics and Celera Corporation. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America when comparing results of operations from period to period. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following table reconciles reported results to adjusted results:
 
 
 
2)The outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per common share, adjusted operating income as a percentage of net revenues and adjusted cash from operations represent management's estimates of diluted earnings per common share, operating income as a percentage of net revenues and cash from operations for the full year 2011 before the impact of the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, restructuring charges, and transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Athena Diagnostics and Celera Corporation. These measures are presented because management believes they are useful adjuncts to the corresponding amounts determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since they are meaningful to evaluate the Company's ongoing operating performance and are on a basis consistent with previous estimates of diluted earnings per common share, operating income as a percentage of net revenues and cash from operations. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, adjusted operating income as a percentage of net revenues and adjusted cash from operations are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding amounts determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
  
 
     The following table reconciles our 2011 outlook, on an adjusted basis, to the corresponding amounts determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The outlook, on an adjusted basis, excludes the first quarter impact of the Medi-Cal charge, the estimated impact of severe weather, restructuring charges and costs associated with the Athena and Celera transactions.
 
(a) Represents the first quarter pre-tax charge of $236 million associated with the agreement in principle related to Medi-Cal.
 
(b) Represents an estimate of the impact of severe weather.
 
(c) Represents first quarter pre-tax restructuring charges of $13.3 million principally associated with workforce reductions.
 
(d) Represents first quarter pre-tax transaction costs of $4.7 million associated with the acquisitions of Athena Diagnostics and Celera Corporation. Of these costs, $2.3 million, primarily related to professional and filing fees, was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses and $2.4 million of financing related costs were recorded in interest expense, net.
 
(e) Not significant to the outlook for cash flows from operations.
