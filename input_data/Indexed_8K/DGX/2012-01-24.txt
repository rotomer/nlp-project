"We continued to make progress in executing our growth plan and reducing costs. In 2011, we established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities focused on cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and neurological disorders. In addition, we commenced a multi-year $500 million cost-reduction initiative and returned $1 billion in cash to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Beginning in 2012, we are increasing our quarterly cash dividend by 70%, and today, we announced our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We are well positioned for the future, and remain focused on increasing shareholder value."

Before these items, cash flow was $1.1 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2010. During 2011, the company repurchased $935 million of its common shares.
As used in this press release, the term adjusted refers to the operating performance measures that exclude the Medi-Cal charge, restructuring and integration charges, transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Athena and Celera, CEO succession costs, an employment litigation settlement, and the estimated impact of severe weather. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
