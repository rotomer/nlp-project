21.           .  Except as otherwise expressly provided pursuant to this Plan, this Plan shall be construed and administered in a manner which avoids duplication of compensation and benefits which may be provided under any other plan, program, policy, or other arrangement.  In the event a Participant is covered by any other plan, program, policy, individually negotiated agreement or other arrangement, in effect as of his or her Date of Termination, that may duplicate the payments provided in Sections 4 or 5, as applicable, the Company is specifically empowered to reduce or eliminate the duplicative benefits provided for under the Plan.  In taking such action, the Company will be guided by the principles that (1) such a Participant will otherwise be treated, for the purpose of the Sections specified above, no more or no less favorably than are other Participants who are not covered by such other plan, program, policy, individually negotiated agreement or other arrangement and (2) the provisions of such other plan, program, policy, individually negotiated agreement or other arrangement (including, but not limited to, a special individual pension, a special deferral account and/or a special equity based grant) which are not duplicative of the payments provided in Sections 4 or 5, as applicable, will not be considered in determining elimination and/or reductions in Plan benefits.

The reduction of the Payments, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections of this Plan in the following order: (i) Section 5(a), (ii) Section 5(b) and (iii) Section 5(c) (in the order set forth in such Section 5(c)).  For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap, only amounts payable under this Plan (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  If the reduction of the amounts payable hereunder would not result in a greater after tax result to the Participant, no amounts payable under this Plan shall be reduced pursuant to this provision.

(b)  All determinations required to be made under this Appendix A shall be made by a public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the ) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Participant within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Company or the Participant that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company (collectively, the ).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Firm may use the Option Redetermination Amount (as defined in paragraph (c), below) in determining the reduction of the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the Board shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (ii) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (iii) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the person(s) effecting the Change in Control, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company, and the Company shall enter into any agreement reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm in connection with the performance of the services hereunder.  If the Accounting Firm determines that

no Excise Tax is payable by a Participant, it shall furnish the Participant with a written opinion to such effect, and to the effect that failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on the Participants applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  In the event the Accounting Firm determines that the Payments shall be reduced to the Safe Harbor Cap, it shall furnish the Participant with a written opinion to such effect.  The Determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.
 
(c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Payments will have been made to, or provided for the benefit of, a Participant by the Company, which are in excess of the limitations provided in Paragraph (a) (hereinafter referred to as an ), such Overpayment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a loan to the Participant made on the date the Participant received the Overpayment and the Participant shall repay the Overpayment to the Company on demand, together with interest on the Overpayment at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of the Participants receipt of such Overpayment until the date of such repayment.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the Determination, it is possible that Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made to a Participant (an ), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Appendix A.  In the event that it is determined (i) by the Accounting Firm, the Company (which shall include the position taken by the Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or the IRS or (ii) pursuant to a determination by a court, that an Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount equal to such Underpayment to the Participant within ten (10) days of such determination together with interest on such amount at the applicable federal rate from the date such amount would have been paid to the Participant until the date of payment.  The Participant shall cooperate, to the extent his or her expenses are reimbursed by the Company, with any reasonable requests by the Company in connection with any contests or disputes with the IRS in connection with the Excise Tax.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that amounts payable under this Plan were reduced pursuant to Paragraph (a) and the value of stock options is subsequently redetermined  by the Accounting Firm within the context of Treasury Regulation 1.280G-1 Q/A 33 that reduces the value of the Payments attributable to such options (the ), the Company shall pay to the Participant (on the first business day of the calendar year following the year the Option Redetermination is made) any cash payments payable under this Plan that were not previously paid solely as a result of Paragraph (a) up to the Safe Harbor Cap, plus interest from the date such amount would have been paid to the participant until the date of payment at the 3 month Treasury Bill rate.
