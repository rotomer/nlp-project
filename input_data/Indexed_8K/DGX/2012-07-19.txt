Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As used in this press release, the term adjusted refers to the operating performance measures that exclude the Medi-Cal charge, restructuring and integration charges, transaction costs related to acquisitions, CEO succession costs and the estimated impact of severe weather.

Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
