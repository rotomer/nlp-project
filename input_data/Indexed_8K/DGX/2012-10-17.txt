QUEST DIAGNOSTICS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
MADISON, N.J., OCTOBER 17, 2012 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic testing, information and services, announced today that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, adjusted income from continuing operations was $190 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, unchanged from the prior year.
For the third quarter of 2012, reported income from continuing operations was $163 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $172 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in 2011. Income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2012 was reduced by $0.17 per diluted share related to restructuring and integration costs. In the third quarter of 2011, income from continuing operations was reduced by $0.10 per diluted share related to restructuring and integration costs.
Revenues were $1.9 billion for the third quarter, 2.9% below the prior year. Clinical testing revenues decreased 2.1%, with volume, measured by the number of requisitions, 1.1% below the prior year and revenue per requisition 1.0% below the prior year.
For the third quarter of 2012, adjusted operating income was $353 million, or 19.1% of revenues, compared to
$349 million, or 18.3% of revenues
, for 2011. Reported operating income was $309 million, or 16.7% of revenues, compared to $322 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in 2011. Cash provided by operations was $395 million, compared to $338 million in 2011.  During the third quarter of 2012, the company reduced outstanding debt by $292 million and repurchased $50 million of its common shares.
During the quarter, we increased adjusted operating income and delivered strong cash flow, despite continued soft revenues, thanks in large part to our accelerated Invigorate cost-reduction initiative, said Steve Rusckowski, President and CEO. Our new organizational structure and management team, announced last week, will allow us to drive operational excellence and improve our customer focus, which will, over time, enable us to restore growth. We remain focused on increasing shareholder returns through a combination of improved operating performance and disciplined capital deployment.
Year-to-Date Performance
For the first nine months of 2012, revenues increased 1.1% from 2011, to $5.7 billion.

On a reported basis, income from continuing operations was $500 million, or $3.11 per diluted share, compared to $282 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2011.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures
As used in this press release, the term adjusted refers to the operating performance measures that exclude the Medi-Cal charge, restructuring and integration charges, transaction costs related to acquisitions, CEO succession costs and the estimated impact of severe weather. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
