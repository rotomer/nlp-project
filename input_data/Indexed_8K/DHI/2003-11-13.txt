Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "We are pleased to conclude our 26
th
year of consecutive growth in earnings and revenues with a very strong balance sheet. Our shareholders' equity grew 34% to $3.0 billion, which is an incredible number compared to the $3,000 of beginning equity in 1978. Our $3.0 billion equity base contributed to our record low homebuilding net debt to cap of 40%. Strong earnings and controlled internal growth generated positive free cash flow this year, and we finished the year with $583 million in cash and $709 million available on our revolver, for a total of approximately $1.3 billion in dry powder.'
 
"We ended the year on an extremely positive note with a 21% organic increase in our fourth quarter sales and strong sales performances in all of our states. Our double-digit sales increase and our record $3.7 billion backlog position us to make fiscal year 2004 our 27
th
year of record earnings and revenues."
