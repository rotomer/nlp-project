D.R. HORTON, INC. REPORTS A 66% INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2004 FIRST QUARTER NET INCOME
Quarter Highlights
      D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) Wednesday (January 21, 2004), reported that net income for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003 increased 66% to $185.6 million ($0.78 per diluted share), compared to $111.8 million ($0.50 per diluted share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2002. All outstanding shares and per share amounts reflect the Company's 3 for 2 stock split, which became effective on January 12, 2004. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 26% to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion in the year ago quarter. Homes closed for the first quarter increased 23% to 9,242 homes from 7,514 homes a year ago.
ARLINGTON, TEXAS
     The Company reported a record December 31, 2003 sales contract backlog of $3.6 billion (14,480 homes), an increase of 24% from $2.9 billion (12,435 homes) a year ago. The Company previously reported that net sales orders for the quarter increased 20% to $2.0 billion (8,234 homes) from $1.7 billion (7,252 homes) for the same quarter last year.
     The Company expects diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.70 (assuming approximately 237 million diluted shares). The Company expects diluted
 
earnings per share for fiscal year 2004 to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 (assuming approximately 237 million diluted shares). This range represents a 15% to 19% increase in earnings per share over the $2.73 reported in fiscal year 2003, and is based on projected revenues of approximately $9.6 to $9.8 billion (approximately 41,000 to 42,000 homes closed).
     D.R. Horton's earnings release conference call will be Thursday, January 22, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. EST. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096, and the call will also be webcast from www.DRHORTON.com on the "Investor Relations" page.
     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "We are extremely pleased with the Company's first quarter performance, where once again we grew our net income at a faster pace than our revenues. The Company's continued double-digit sales momentum combined with our record $3.6 billion backlog, provide a solid foundation for achieving our 27th consecutive year of record revenues and earnings in fiscal year 2004."

All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

fiscal year 2004.
