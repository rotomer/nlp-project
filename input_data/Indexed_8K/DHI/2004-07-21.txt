     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "D.R. Horton had another quarter of exceptional net sales orders, with each of our reporting regions producing double digit sales dollar increases. Through June 30th, the Company has already earned $1 billion in pre-tax income and $625.5 million in net income, approximately what we earned in all of fiscal year 2003. These results ensure fiscal year 2004 will be our 27th consecutive year of growth and profitability. Our continued sales momentum and $5.2 billion sales backlog position D.R. Horton for another record year in fiscal year 2005."
