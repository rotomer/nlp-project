The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree with each Underwriter as follows: (a) The Issuers will, if necessary or required by law, file an amendment to the Registration Statement or, if necessary pursuant to Rule 430A under the Act, a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and will use their best efforts to cause the Registration Statement or such post-effective amendment to become effective at the earliest possible time. The Company will comply fully and in a timely manner with the applicable provisions of Rule 424 and Rule 430A under the Act. (b) The Issuers will advise you promptly and, if requested by you, will confirm such advice in writing: (i) of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement; (ii) of the transmission to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus (including any document that would as a result of such filing become an Incorporated Document) and to furnish you with copies thereof; (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission that relate to the Registration Statement or of any request by the Commission for amendment of or a supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or of the suspension of qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or the threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) within the period of time referred to in paragraph (e) below, of any change in the Company's condition (financial or other), business, prospects, properties, net worth or results of operations, or of the happening of any event, which makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) untrue or which requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) in order to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or of the necessity to amend or supplement the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) to comply with the Act or any other law. If at any time any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or suspending any such qualification shall be issued, the Issuers will promptly use their best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest possible time.

(f) If during the period of time referred to in paragraph (e) above any event shall occur as a result of which, in the judgment of the Issuers or in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or any other law, the Issuers will forthwith prepare and, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) above, file with the Commission an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, will not, in the light of the circumstances when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the Prospectus will comply with law, and to furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as you shall specify such number of copies thereof as the Underwriters or such dealers may reasonably request.

(h) The Issuers will make generally available to its security holders a consolidated earnings statement, which need not be audited, covering a twelve-month period commencing after the date of the Prospectus and ending not later than 15 months thereafter, as soon as practicable after the end of such period, which consolidated earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 thereunder, and will advise you in writing when such statement has been made available.

-8- necessary to own or hold their respective properties and to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged.

(p) The Company and its subsidiaries own the items of real property and personal property purported to be owned by them which are material to the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects, except such as are described in the Prospectus or such as would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All real property held under lease by the Company and its subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases, with such exceptions as are described in the Prospectus or such as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(s) To the Issuers' knowledge, all real property owned (either presently or at any time in the past) or presently leased by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with the operation of their business, including, without limitation, any subsurface soils and ground water (collectively, the "Realty"), is free of contamination from any substance or material presently known to be toxic or hazardous, including, without limitation, any radioactive substance, methane, volatile hydrocarbons or industrial solvents (each, a "Hazardous Substance"), which could reasonably be expected to materially impair the beneficial use thereof by the Company and its subsidiaries or constitute or cause a significant health, safety or other environmental hazard to occupants or users (except for contaminations which would not have a Material Adverse Effect); and to the Issuers' knowledge, the Realty does not contain any underground storage or treatment tanks, active or abandoned water, gas or oil wells, or any other underground improvements or structures, other than the foundations, footings or other supports for the improvements located thereon, the presence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hazardous Substances shall be deemed not to include any supplies or substances maintained, used, stored or held on the Realty which are (i) naturally occurring, (ii) installed by public utilities or (iii) used in the ordinary course of the Company's or its subsidiaries' business, provided that such supplies or substances are stored, used, maintained and held
-11- in all material respects in accordance with any applicable governmental requirements and with restrictions, conditions and standards suggested by the manufacturer and the Company's insurance carriers. (t) The Company and its subsidiaries carry, or are covered by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is adequate for the conduct of their respective businesses. (u) The Company and its subsidiaries own or possess adequate rights to use all material patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights and licenses necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect and have no reason to believe that the conduct of their respective businesses will conflict with, and have not received any notice of any claim of conflict with, any such rights of others which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(y) Since the date as of which information is given in the Prospectus, and except as may otherwise be disclosed in the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has (i) entered into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business or (ii) declared or paid any dividend on its capital stock, and, from the date of the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any liability other than in the ordinary course of business that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(aa) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (i) is in violation of its organizational documents, (ii) is in default in any material respect, and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the due performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its properties or assets is subject as a result of which default there would be a Material Adverse Effect or (iii) is in violation of any law, ordinance, governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which it or its property or assets may be subject or has failed to obtain any license, permit, certificate, franchise or other governmental authorization or permit necessary to the ownership of its property or to the conduct of its business which violation or failure would have a Material Adverse Effect.

Indemnification. (a) The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Underwriter Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter Indemnified Party asserted by a person with respect to any such losses, claims, damages and liabilities and judgments, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Issuers shall have furnished such amendment or supplement thereto in the requisite quantity on a timely basis to permit such sending or giving) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter or related Underwriter Indemnified Party to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Securities to such
-13- person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended and supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or judgment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Underwriter shall be obligated to send or give any Incorporated Document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to any person in order to benefit from the indemnity provisions herein or otherwise. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Issuers may otherwise have. (b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter Indemnified Party, based upon any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Issuers, the Underwriters shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing and the Issuers shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Issuers, (ii) the Issuers shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter Indemnified Party and the Issuers and such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuers (in which case the Issuers shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Issuers shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriter Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by UBS Securities LLC and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Issuers shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without the Company's written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Issuers agree to indemnify and hold harmless any Underwriter Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter Indemnified Parties, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Underwriter Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Underwriter Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Underwriter Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, their directors, their officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Issuers within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or
-14- Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to the Underwriter Indemnified Parties but only with reference to information relating to an Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus. In case any action shall be brought against the Issuers, any of its directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Issuers based on the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Issuers (except that if the Issuers shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Issuers, their directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Issuers shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters, by Section 7(b) hereof. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the compensation received by the Underwriters (based on discount to investors on resale), bear to the sum of such total net proceeds and such compensation. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or any Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
-15- connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) Each Underwriter confirms and the Issuers acknowledge that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Securities by such Underwriter set forth in the fourth and sixth paragraphs of the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 8. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligation. The obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities under this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (a) All the representations and warranties of the Issuers contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct on the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date. The Issuers shall have performed or complied with all of their agreements herein contained and required to be performed or complied with by them at or prior to the Closing Date. (b) (i) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been commenced or shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission, (ii) every request for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with in all material respects, and (iii) no stop order suspending the sale of the Securities in any jurisdiction referred to in Section 6(f) shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been commenced or shall be pending or threatened which would, in your reasonable judgment, make it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities. (c) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any Issuer's debt by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.
-16- (d) (i) Since the date of the latest balance sheet included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, affairs or business prospects, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) since the date of the latest balance sheet included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock or in the long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries from that set forth in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and (iii) the Company and its subsidiaries shall have no liability or obligation, direct or contingent, which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than those reflected in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (e) You shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate dated the Closing Date, signed by (i) Donald R. Horton, Donald J. Tomnitz or Samuel R. Fuller and (ii) Bill W. Wheat or Stacey H. Dwyer in their capacities as (A) the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President or Senior Executive Vice President and (B) Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer of the Company, respectively, confirming the matters set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 8. (f) You shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion (satisfactory to you and counsel for the Underwriters), dated the Closing Date, of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, special counsel for the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto. (g) You shall have received on the Closing Date letters, dated the Closing Date, of Cahill Gordon and Reindel LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters. (h) You shall have received a letter on and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, from Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants, with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and substantially in the form and substance of the letter previously delivered to you by Ernst & Young LLP in connection with the Registration Statement and Prospectus. (i) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements in the Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus or (ii) since such date there shall not have been any change in the capital stock, net revenues, per share or total amounts of income before extraordinary income or of net
-17- income or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is, in the judgment of the Underwriters, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities being delivered on the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. (j) The Issuers shall have furnished to you such other documents and certificates as to the accuracy and completeness of any statement in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as you reasonably may request. (k) You shall have been furnished with such additional documents and certificates as you or counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request. All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to you and your counsel. Any certificate or document signed by any officer of the Issuers and delivered to you or to your counsel shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Issuers to the Underwriters as to the statements made therein. 9. Default by an Underwriter. If an Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriter shall be obligated to take up and pay for (in the proportion which the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule A hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the name of the remaining Underwriter) the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth in Schedule A hereto, the remaining Underwriter shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such non-defaulting Underwriter does not purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five business days, as the non-defaulting Underwriter shall determine in order that the required changes in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any
-18- defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by UBS Securities LLC by written notice to the Issuers if any of the following has occurred: (i) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, any material adverse change or development involving a prospective material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Company and its subsidiaries or the earnings, affairs, or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which would, in your judgment, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (ii) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic conditions or in the financial markets of the United States or elsewhere that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and would, in your judgment, make it impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus, (iii) the suspension or material limitation of trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on prices for securities on any such exchange, (iv) the enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any federal or state statute, regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which in your opinion materially and adversely affects, or will materially and adversely affect, the business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (v) the declaration of a banking moratorium by either federal or New York State authorities or (vi) the taking of any action by any federal, state or local government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which in your opinion has a material adverse effect on the financial markets in the United States. 11. Miscellaneous. Notices given pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be addressed as follows: (a) if to the Issuers, to D.R. Horton, Inc., 1901 Ascension Blvd., Suite 100, Arlington, Texas 76006, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, and (b) if to the Underwriters, to UBS Securities LLC, 677 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901, Attention: High Yield Capital Markets Desk, or in any case to such other address as the person to be notified may have requested in writing. The respective indemnities, contribution agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, its officers and directors (in their capacities as such) and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities, regardless of (i) any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or by or on behalf of the Company, the officers or directors of the Company or any controlling person of the Company (in their capacities as such), (ii)
-19- acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder and (iii) termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Issuer to perform any of its agreements in this Agreement or to fulfill any of the conditions of Section 8 of this Agreement, the Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them. Except as otherwise provided, this Agreement has been and is made solely for the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Issuers, the Underwriters, any controlling persons referred to herein, the other indemnitees referred to herein and their respective successors and assigns, all as and to the extent provided in this Agreement, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter merely because of such purchase. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. This Agreement may be signed in various counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. References herein to "your judgment" or "your opinion" shall be deemed to be the judgment or opinion, as the case may be, of UBS Securities LLC only. [Signature Pages Follow]

(iv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any further amendments or supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the financial data (and the related notes thereto) and statistical data and the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act; the documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and any further amendment or supplement to any such incorporated document made by the Company prior to the Closing Date (other than the financial data (and the related notes thereto) and statistical data and the financial statements, and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission appear on their face to have been
-15- appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act. (v) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no contracts or other documents which are required to be described in the Prospectus or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Act which have not been described in the Prospectus or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or incorporated therein by reference as permitted by the Act. (vi) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers. (vii) The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Securities and the execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and the Securities by the Issuers will not result in a material breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a material default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument listed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003 or to any subsequent filing under the Exchange Act or the Act by the Company, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the articles or certificates of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement, limited partnership agreement, operating agreement or other constitutive document of the Company or any Specified Guarantor under any Applicable Law (as defined below) or any order, judgment or decree known to us under any court or government agency or body of the United States of America or the States of New York, California or Texas having jurisdiction over the Company or any Specified Guarantor or any of its property or assets under any Applicable Law. For the purposes of this clause (vii), the term "Applicable Law" shall mean the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the Nevada General Corporation Law, the present corporation, partnership and limited liability company statutes of the States of California, Texas and Colorado, any of the present laws of the United States of America, any of the present laws of the State of New York, the statutes, rules or regulations of the State of California and Texas, in each case generally applicable to transactions in the nature of those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, and to present judicial interpretations thereto and to the facts as they presently exist. (viii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Specified Guarantors and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with its terms. (ix) The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to the

(x) The Guarantees have been duly authorized and endorsed on the Notes by the Guarantors, and, upon authentication of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivery thereof to the Underwriters against payment therefor as provided by this Agreement, will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will be valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors, enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms. (xi) The Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus. (xii) The Supplemental Indenture is (x) authorized and permitted by the Indenture, (y) not inconsistent with the Indenture and (z) valid and binding upon the Issuers in accordance with its terms. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that its opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the States of Texas and New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such counsel shall also have furnished to the Underwriters a written statement, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect that (x) such counsel has acted as special counsel to the Company in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and during the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and Prospectus, such counsel participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, the Company's internal counsel, and its accountants and the representatives of the Underwriters and at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and (y) based on the foregoing, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel which lead it to believe that (I) the Registration Statement (except as to financial data (and related notes thereto) and statistical data and the financial statements and related schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein), as of the date the Registration Statement became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus (except as to financial data (and related notes thereto) and statistical data and the financial statements and related schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (II) any Incorporated Document or any amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Closing Date, when they were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, contained (except as to
-17- financial data (and related notes thereto) and statistical data and the financial statements and related schedules contained or incorporated by reference therein) an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The foregoing opinion and statement may be qualified by a statement to the effect that such counsel has not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or incorporated by reference therein, and such counsel is not passing upon and such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

(d) In determining the "fair market value of Property" for purposes of clause (iii) of the paragraph (a), Property other than cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities shall be deemed to be equal in value to the "equity value" of the Capital Stock or other securities issued in exchange therefor. The "equity value" of such Capital Stock or other securities shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Equity issued in the transaction (or issuable upon conversion or exercise of the Capital Stock or other securities issued in the transaction) multiplied by the closing sale price of the Common Equity on its principal market on the date of the transaction (less, in the case of Capital Stock or other securities which require the payment of consideration at the time of conversion or exercise, the aggregate consideration payable thereupon) or (ii) if the Common Equity is not then traded on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq National Market, or if the Capital Stock or other securities issued in the transaction do not consist of Common Equity (or Capital Stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Equity), the value of such Capital Stock or other securities as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm retained by the Board of Directors of the Company. Section 3.04. Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. (a) Until the Notes are rated Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies (after which time the following covenant will no longer be in effect), the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any loan, advance, guarantee or capital contribution to, or for the benefit of, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any property or assets to, or for the benefit of, or purchase or lease any property or assets from, or enter into or amend any contract, agreement or understanding with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company or any Affiliate of any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any holder of 10% or more of the Common Equity of the Company (including any Affiliates of such holders), in a single transaction or series of related transactions (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), except for any Affiliate Transaction the terms of which are at least as favorable as the terms which could be obtained by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in a comparable transaction made on an arm's length basis with Persons who are not such a holder, an Affiliate of such a holder or an Affiliate of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries.
-28- (b) In addition, the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into an Affiliate Transaction unless (i) with respect to any such Affiliate Transaction involving or having a value of more than $10 million, the Company shall have (x) obtained the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company and (y) either obtained the approval of a majority of the Company's disinterested directors or obtained an opinion of a qualified independent financial advisor to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a financial point of view and (ii) with respect to any such Affiliate Transaction involving or having a value of more than $50 million, the Company shall have (x) obtained the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company and (y) delivered to the Trustee an opinion of a qualified independent financial advisor to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a financial point of view. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Affiliate Transaction will not include (i) any contract, agreement or understanding with, or for the benefit of, or plan for the benefit of employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries generally (in their capacities as such) that has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) Capital Stock issuances to directors, officers and employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to plans approved by the stockholders of the Company, (iii) any Restricted Payment otherwise permitted under Section 3.03, (iv) any transaction between or among the Company and one or more Restricted Subsidiaries or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries (provided, however, no such transaction shall involve any other Affiliate of the Company (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the extent the applicable amount constitutes a Restricted Payment permitted by this Indenture)) and (v) any transaction between one or more Restricted Subsidiaries and one or more Unrestricted Subsidiaries where all of the payments to, or other benefits conferred upon, such Unrestricted Subsidiaries are substantially contemporaneously dividended, or otherwise distributed or transferred without charge, to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary. Section 3.05. Limitations on Dispositions of Assets. Until the Notes are rated Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies (after which time the following covenant will no longer be in effect), the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless (x) the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the Fair Market Value thereof, and (y) not less than 70% of the consideration received by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. The amount of any Indebtedness (other than any Indebtedness subordinated to the Notes) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is actually assumed by the transferee in such Asset Disposition shall be deemed to be consideration required by clause (y) above for purposes of determining the percentage of such consideration received by the Company or the Restricted
-29- Subsidiaries. The Net Cash Proceeds of an Asset Disposition shall, within one year, at the Company's election, (a) be used by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in the business of the construction and sale of homes conducted by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries or any other business of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary existing at the time of such Asset Disposition or (b) to the extent not so used, be applied to make a Net Cash Proceeds Offer for the Notes and, if the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary elects or is required to do so, repay, purchase or redeem any other unsubordinated Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis if the amount available for such repayment, purchase or redemption is less than the aggregate amount of (i) the principal amount of the Notes tendered in such Net Cash Proceeds Offer and (ii) the lesser of the principal amount, or accreted value, of such other unsubordinated Indebtedness, plus, in each case accrued interest to the date of repayment, purchase or redemption) at 100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, as the case may be, plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase or repayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company will not be required to apply such Net Cash Proceeds to the repurchase of Notes in accordance with clause (b) of the preceding sentence except to the extent that such Net Cash Proceeds, together with the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of prior Asset Dispositions (other than those so used) which have not been applied in accordance with this provision and as to which no prior Net Cash Proceeds Offer shall have been made, exceed 5% of Consolidated Tangible Assets and (B) in connection with any Asset Disposition, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with the requirements of clause (y) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the extent that the aggregate non-cash consideration received in connection with such Asset Disposition, together with the sum of all non-cash consideration received in connection with all prior Asset Dispositions that has not yet been converted into cash, does not exceed 5% of Consolidated Tangible Assets; provided, however, that when any non-cash consideration is converted into cash, such cash shall constitute Net Cash Proceeds and be subject to the preceding sentence. Section 3.06. Limitations on Liens. The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens, other than Permitted Liens, on any of its Property, or on any shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, unless contemporaneously therewith or prior thereto all payments due under this Indenture and the Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligation or liability so secured until such time as such obligation or liability is no longer secured by a Lien. Section 3.07. Limitations on Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction (other than encumbrances or restrictions imposed by law or by judicial or regulatory action or by provisions of leases and other agreements that restrict the
-30- assignability thereof) on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, owned by the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, or pay interest on or principal of any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) make loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, or (iii) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, except for (a) encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of applicable law, (b) covenants or restrictions contained in Indebtedness in effect on the Issue Date as such covenants or restrictions are in effect on such date, (c) any restrictions or encumbrances arising under Acquired Indebtedness; provided, that such encumbrance or restriction applies only to either the assets that were subject to the restriction or encumbrance at the time of the acquisition or the obligor on such Indebtedness and its Subsidiaries, (d) any restrictions or encumbrances arising in connection with Refinancing Indebtedness; provided, however, that any restrictions and encumbrances of the type described in this clause (d) that arise under such Refinancing Indebtedness shall not be materially more restrictive than those under the agreement creating or evidencing the Indebtedness being refunded, refinanced, replaced or extended, (e) any Permitted Lien, or any other agreement restricting the sale or other disposition of property, securing Indebtedness permitted by this Indenture if such Permitted Lien or agreement does not expressly restrict the ability of a Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or make or repay loans or advances prior to default thereunder, (f) reasonable and customary borrowing base covenants set forth in agreements evidencing Indebtedness otherwise permitted by this Indenture, (g) customary provisions restricting subletting or assignment of any lease governing a leasehold interest of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (h) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition. Section 3.08. Limitations on Mergers, Consolidations and Sales of Assets. Neither the company nor any Guarantor will consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets (including, without limitation, by way of liquidation or dissolution), or assign any of its obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees or this Indenture (as an entirety or substantially in one transaction or in a series of related transactions), to any Person (in each case other than in a transaction in which the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is the survivor of a consolidation or merger, or the transferee in a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition) unless: (i) the Person formed by or surviving such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be), or to which such sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition or assignment will be made (collectively, the "Successor"), is a corporation or other legal entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, and the Successor assumes by supplemental indenture in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee all of the obligations of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, under
-31- the Notes or a Guarantee, as the case may be, and the Indenture, (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the use of any net proceeds therefrom, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company or the Successor (in the case of a transaction involving the Company), as the case may be, would be at least equal to the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately prior to such transaction (exclusive of any adjustments to Consolidated Net Worth attributable to transaction costs) less any amount treated as a Restricted Payment in connection with such transaction in accordance with this Indenture and (iv) unless prior to such transaction the Notes are rated Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies (after which this clause (iv) shall not apply), immediately after giving effect to such transaction, the Company could incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 3.02(a) hereof. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to (i) a transaction involving the sale or disposition of Capital Stock of a Guarantor, or the consolidation or merger of a Guarantor, or the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor, that in any such case results in such Guarantor being released from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture or (ii) a transaction the purpose of which is to change the state of incorporation of the Company or any Guarantor. Section 3.09. Reports to Holders of Notes. The Company will file with the Commission the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company will file with the Trustee and mail to each Holder of record of Notes such reports, information and documents within 15 days after it files them with the Commission. In the event that the Company is no longer subject to these periodic requirements of the Exchange Act, it will nonetheless continue to file reports with the Commission and the Trustee and mail such reports to each Holder of Notes as if it were subject to such reporting requirements. Regardless of whether the Company is required to furnish such reports to its stockholders pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company will cause its consolidated financial statements and a "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" written report, similar to those that would have been required to appear in annual or quarterly reports, to be delivered to Holders of Notes. ARTICLE FOUR MISCELLANEOUS Section 4.01. Governing Law. The laws of the State of New York shall govern this Supplemental Indenture, the Securities of each Series and the Guarantees.
-32- Section 4.02. No Adverse Interpretation of Other Agreements. This Supplemental Indenture may not be used to interpret another indenture, loan or debt agreement of the Company or a Subsidiary. Any such indenture, loan or debt agreement may not be used to interpret this Supplemental Indenture. Section 4.03. No Recourse Against Others. All liability described in paragraph 13 of the Notes of any director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor is waived and released. Section 4.04. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors in this Supplemental Indenture and the Notes shall bind its successors and assigns. All agreements of the Trustee in this Supplemental Indenture shall bind its successors and assigns. Section 4.05. Duplicate Originals. The parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement. Section 4.06. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Supplemental Indenture or of the Notes.

D.R. HORTON, INC. 5.625% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2014 1. Interest. D.R. HORTON, INC. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on September 15 and March 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2005, until the principal is paid or made available for payment. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance, provided that, if there is no existing default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding interest payment date, interest shall accrue from such interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 2. Method of Payment. The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest, if any, which will be paid on such special payment date to Holders of record on such special record date as may be fixed by the Company) to the persons who are registered Holders of Securities at the close of business on the September 1 and March 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. 3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Trustee") will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change or appoint any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar. 4. Indenture. The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 9, 1997 among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, as supplemented (the "Indenture"). The terms of the Securities and the Guarantees include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Securities and the Guarantees are subject to all such A-3
terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of them. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings given to those terms in the Indenture. The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture and the applicable Authorizing Resolution or supplemental indenture. Requests may be made to: D.R. Horton, Inc., 1901 Ascension Blvd., Suite 100, Arlington, Texas 76006, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. 5. Optional Redemption Except as set forth in the following sentence, the Securities will not be redeemable. At any time and from time to time on or before September 15, 2007, the Company may redeem Securities with the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings by the Company, at a redemption price equal to 105.625% of the principal amount of such Securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of redemption; provided, that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, excluding any Securities held by the Company or any of its Affiliates, remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption. Notice of any such redemption must be given within 60 days after the date of the closing of the relevant Public Equity Offering. 6. Selection and Notice of Redemption Selection of the Securities or portions thereof for redemption pursuant to the foregoing shall be made by the Trustee only on a pro rata basis or on as nearly a pro rata basis as is practicable (subject to the procedures of The Depository Trust Company), unless such method is otherwise prohibited. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder whose Securities are to be redeemed at the registered address of such Holder. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption, provided that if the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price together with accrued interest, interest shall continue to accrue at the rate borne by the Securities. 7. Denominations, Transfer, Exchange. The Securities are in registered form only without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities by presentation of such Securities to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Security selected for redemption, except the unredeemed part thereof if the Security is redeemed in part, or transfer A-4
or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed. 8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Security shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 9. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its request. After that, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment unless an abandoned property law designates another person. 10. Amendment, Supplement, Waiver. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities and any past default or compliance with any provision relating to the Securities may be waived in a particular instance with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities. Without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, to create a Series and establish its terms, to remove a Guarantor which, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, ceases to be liable in respect of its Guarantee, or to make any other change, provided such action does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder. 11. Successor Corporation. When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligations. 12. Trustee Dealings With Company. American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its affiliates, as if it were not Trustee. A-5
13. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. 14. Discharge of Indenture. The Indenture contains certain provisions pertaining to defeasance, which provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth herein. 15. Authentication. This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 16. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gift to Minors Act).

[FORM OF NOTATION ON SECURITY RELATING TO GUARANTEE] GUARANTEE The undersigned (the "Guarantors") have unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally (such guarantee by each Guarantor being referred to herein as the "Guarantee") (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on the Securities, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal and interest, if any, on the Securities, to the extent lawful, and the due and punctual performance of all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee all in accordance with the terms set forth in Article Nine of the Indenture and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. No past, present or future stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator, as such, of any of the Guarantors shall have any liability under the Guarantee by reason of such person's status as stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator. Each holder of a Security by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Guarantees. Each holder of a Security by accepting a Security agrees that any Guarantor named below shall have no further liability with respect to its Guarantee if such Guarantor otherwise ceases to be liable in respect of its Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Exhibit 5.1
D.R. Horton, Inc. 1901 Ascension Blvd., Suite 100 Arlington, Texas 76006
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     As counsel for D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), we are familiar with the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (as amended, the "Registration Statement") (File No. 333-117531), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 21, 2004 under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the "Act"), and the prospectus and prospectus supplement with respect thereto, dated September 14, 2004 (together, the "Prospectus"), with respect to the proposed offering by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") of the Company. The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 9, 1997, as supplemented (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the guarantors named therein (the "Guarantors") and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as further supplemented by the Twentieth Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of September 21, 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, and will be guaranteed pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture and the notation thereof endorsed on the Notes on a senior basis by the Guarantors (the "Guarantees"). All capitalized terms which are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Statement. The Notes and related Guarantees, the Indenture and Supplemental Indenture are referred to herein as the "Note Documents."
     For the purpose of rendering this opinion, we have made such factual and legal examination as we deemed necessary under the circumstances, and in that connection we have examined, among other things, originals or copies of the following:
 
D.R. Horton, Inc. September 17, 2004 Page 2
     (1) Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, incorporated by reference from Exhibit 4.2 to the Company's registration statement (No. 333-76175) on Form S-3, filed with the Commission on April 13, 1999;
     (2) Amendment to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, incorporated by reference from Exhibit 3.1(a) to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, filed with the Commission on February 18, 2003;
     (3) Amended and Restated Bylaws, incorporated by reference from Exhibit 3.1 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 1998, filed with the Commission on February 16, 1999;
     (4) Indenture and the form of Supplemental Indenture (and form of Notes and related Guarantees);
     (5) Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 for the Notes, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; and
     (6) Such records of the corporate proceedings of the Company, such certificates and assurances from public officials, officers and representatives of the Company, and such other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purpose of rendering this opinion.
In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have assumed:
     (a) The genuineness of all signatures on, and the authenticity of, all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. With respect to agreements and instruments executed by natural persons, we have assumed the legal competency of such persons.
     (b) Each of the parties to the Note Documents other than the Company (including, without limitation, the Guarantors) is a validly existing corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of its state of formation and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Note Documents to which it is a party, and the execution and delivery of such Note Documents by such party and performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such party.
 
D.R. Horton, Inc. September 17, 2004 Page 3
     (c) The Note Documents will be duly and validly executed and delivered by the Trustee. The Note Documents will constitute the legal, valid and binding agreements of the Trustee.
     (d) There are no agreements or understandings between or among the parties to the Note Documents that would expand, modify or otherwise affect the terms of the Note Documents or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder.
     On the basis of the foregoing examination, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that when the Notes and the Guarantees shall have been executed and authenticated as specified in the Indenture and Supplemental Indenture and offered and sold as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the Notes and the Guarantees will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively.
     The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions:
     A. We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the United States of America. Our opinions set forth herein are limited to the effect of the present state of applicable laws of the State of New York and the United States of America and to the facts as they presently exist. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement our opinions should the present laws, or the interpretation thereof, be changed or to revise or supplement these opinions in respect of any circumstances or events that occur subsequent to the date hereof.
     B. Our opinions set forth herein are subject to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers), (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether a matter is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and (iii) laws affecting distributions by corporations, limited liability companies or partnerships to stockholders, members or partners.
     C. We express no opinion herein as to the effect on the Guarantees of any facts or circumstances that would constitute a defense to the obligation of a surety, unless such
 
D.R. Horton, Inc. September 17, 2004 Page 4
defense may be waived under applicable law and has been waived effectively by the Guarantors.
     This opinion may be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. Consent is also given to the reference to this firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
