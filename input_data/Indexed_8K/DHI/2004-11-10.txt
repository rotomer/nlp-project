     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Fiscal year 2004 was our 27th consecutive year of growth in earnings and revenues. In addition to setting Company records, D.R. Horton is establishing industry records. The Company is the first builder to close more than 40,000 homes and sell more than 45,000 homes in a year. We have accomplished this leadership position while continuing to improve our balance sheet. Our shareholders' equity grew 31% to $4.0 billion, contributing to our record low homebuilding net debt to cap of 38.9%. We finished the year with $480 million in homebuilding cash and approximately $1.1 billion available on our revolving credit facility, for a total of approximately $1.6 billion in dry powder.'
     "We ended the year on an extremely positive note with a 17% organic increase in our fourth quarter sales and strong sales performances in all of our regions. Our double-digit sales increase and our record $4.6 billion backlog position us for a strong start to fiscal year 2005."
