     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Fiscal year 2005 was our 28 consecutive year of growth in earnings and revenues. In addition to setting Company records, D.R. Horton is establishing industry records. The Company is the first builder to sell and close more than 50,000 homes in a year. We have accomplished this leadership position while continuing to improve our balance sheet. Our shareholders' equity grew 35% to $5.4 billion, contributing to our record low homebuilding net debt to cap of 32.2%. The improvement in our balance sheet combined with our
th
 
strong operating results resulted in our recent upgrade to investment grade status by Moody's Investors Service.
     "We ended the year on an extremely positive note with a 33% organic increase in our fourth quarter sales and strong sales performances in all of our regions. Our double-digit sales increase and our record $5.8 billion backlog position us for a strong start to fiscal year 2006."
