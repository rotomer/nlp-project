The Collateral is now being delivered to you as custodian for pooling in connection with the issuance of securities to be based on and backed by such Collateral (i.e., the issuance of "mortgage-backed securities"). If within forty-five (45) days after the date of this letter the Administrative Agent has not received the mortgage-backed securities themselves, then you must return the Collateral itself to the Collateral Agent. Until such time as the Collateral Agent receives the mortgage-backed securities in exchange for the Collateral or the Collateral itself, you shall be deemed to hold the Collateral (1) subject to the conditions stated in the immediately preceding sentence, (2) in trust for the use and benefit of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement), (3) subject to and burdened by the security interest granted pursuant to the Security Agreement to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations and (4) as the Administrative Agent's bailee in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in the State of Delaware. You have no property interest in the Collateral until you send the mortgage-backed securities to the Collateral Agent, but instead have only the naked right to possession of the Collateral as bailee and trustee for the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations and subject to all of the terms and conditions of this letter. If you receive conflicting or inconsistent instructions regarding the Collateral from the Company and the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, you agree to act in accordance with the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent's instructions. It is understood that the Collateral Agent is delivering the Collateral, and will be receiving the mortgage-backed securities, or cash, as agent and bailee for the holders of the Obligations.

Otherwise, please notify us and return all of the enclosed Collateral to us immediately and in any event within ten (10) days after the date of this letter. If you fail to either (a) execute and return a copy of this letter to the Collateral Agent or (b) return to the Collateral Agent all of the enclosed Collateral within ten (10) days after this letter's date, then you shall have accepted possession of the Collateral as the Collateral Agent's bailee, in trust, subject to the security interest granted to the Administrative Agent for the use and benefit of the holders of the Obligations, and on the conditions specified in this letter.
If the mortgage-backed securities are not received by the Collateral Agent in exchange for the enclosed Collateral on or before forty-five (45) days after this letter's date, then you are instructed to return all of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent (although that shall not affect or impair any claim or cause of action against you in respect of your Take-Out Commitment).
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW WHICH SHALL APPLY HERETO).
