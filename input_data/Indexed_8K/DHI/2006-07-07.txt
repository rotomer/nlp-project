The provisions of this are (and are intended solely) for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Debt, on the other hand, and nothing contained in this or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended to impair, or shall impair, as between the Originator and the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies, the obligations of the Originator to the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies or to affect (except to the extent specifically provided above in this ) the relative rights of the Companies, the Affiliates of the Companies and creditors of the Originator other than the holders of Senior Debt.

Nothing herein requires the payment in full of maturing tranches of Senior Debt as a condition to the payment of Originator's costs in the ordinary course so long as the maturing tranche of debt will be paid timely and in the ordinary course.
9. The subordination provided for in this Subordination Agreement is unconditional, and no right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Originator or the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies or by any act or failure to act by any holder of any Senior Debt or Borrower or the Administrative Agent or by any noncompliance by the Originator or the Companies or any Affiliate of the Companies with the terms, provisions and covenants of the Transaction Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder might have or be chargeable or charged with. The obligations of the Companies are unconditional irrespective of the validity or enforceability or collectability of the Senior Debt or any other circumstance whatsoever which might constitute a legal or equitable defense of a guarantor or of the Companies hereunder, any and all such defenses being hereby expressly waived by the Companies.
10. Borrower or the Administrative Agent or any other holder of Senior Debt may, at any time without the consent of or notice to the Companies or any other holder of Subordinated Debt, without incurring responsibility to the Companies or such other holder of Subordinated Debt, without impairing or releasing the terms or obligations of this Subordination Agreement, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part:
(1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase or alter any Senior Debt and the subordinations herein made and provided for shall apply to the Senior Debt as so changed, extended, increased, renewed or altered in any manner;
 
(2) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure or securing the Senior Debt or any offset against any Senior Debt;

(4) settle or compromise any Senior Debt.
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, or any prior termination hereof, this Agreement and the obligations of the Companies hereunder shall be automatically reinstated if at any time any payment, settlement or compromise of any of the Senior Debt is rescinded, set aside or vacated by a Governmental Authority or required to be returned or repaid to the Originator or any Person on its behalf for any reason whatsoever. No delay on the part of Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other holder of Senior Debt in exercising any right under this or any other agreement, including the Transaction Documents, or failure to exercise any such right shall operate as a waiver of such right. In no event shall any modification or waiver of the provisions of this Subordination Agreement be effective unless in writing, nor shall any such waiver be applicable except in the specific instance for which it may be given.
Each Company, for itself and all other present and future holders of Subordinated Debt (including, without limitation, Subordinated Debt held or originated by Affiliates of the Originator other than such Company), agrees to execute and deliver to Borrower, the Administrative Agent and to any other holder or holders of Senior Debt requesting it, such further instruments, and to take such other action, as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of Borrower, the Administrative Agent or such other holder or holders of Senior Debt, and upon request of Borrower, the Administrative Agent or such other holder or holders, to fully effectuate the subordinations provided for in this Subordination Agreement and in accordance with its terms.
11. This Subordination Agreement shall bind and benefit the parties hereto and their respective successors, custodians, receivers, trustees and assigns, and the provisions of this Subordination Agreement shall be enforceable by Borrower, the Administrative Agent or directly by the holders of Senior Debt. Borrower (and any assignee of Borrower) may at any time assign any and all of its rights hereunder to any other person or entity holding an interest in the Senior Debt without the consent of any of the Companies, whereupon (i) each reference herein to Borrower shall mean and be a reference to such assignee and (ii) such assignee may enforce this Subordination Agreement to the fullest extent as if it were a named party hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Company acknowledges and consents to the assignment by Borrower, under and in connection with the Loan Agreement, of all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under this Subordination Agreement to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, and each Company agrees that at all times that the Loan Agreement shall be in effect (i) any claim made by Borrower hereunder shall be deemed made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (ii) any payment or remittance to be made hereunder by any Company in respect of any claim being made by or in respect of Borrower or Senior Debt due to Borrower under the Repurchase Agreement shall be paid or remitted to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.
 
12. THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW WHICH SHALL APPLY HERETO). Neither acceptance nor execution of this Subordination Agreement by Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any holder of Senior Debt shall be necessary to cause this Subordination Agreement to be or remain in full force and effect from and after the date of its execution and delivery by the Companies to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and each Company's obligations under this Subordination Agreement are unconditional. This Subordination Agreement may not be revoked or amended except by an instrument in writing executed by each Company, Borrower and the Administrative Agent. Any holder of Senior Debt may at any time and without notice waive in whole or in part any provision of this Subordination Agreement as to all or part of the Senior Debt held by such holder (but may not affect or impair the rights of any other holder of Senior Debt), but no such waiver shall be effective unless expressly stated in a writing signed by such holder.
13. THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BY THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
14. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT:
(a) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS.

(b) TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM THE JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID TO EXECUTION, EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT.
