D.R. HORTON, INC., AMERICA'S BUILDER, REPORTS NET SALES ORDERS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2006 AND REVISES FISCAL YEAR 2006 GUIDANCE
- D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America's Builder, the largest homebuilder in the United States, Thursday (July 13, 2006), reported net sales orders for the third quarter ended June 30, 2006 of 14,316 homes ($3.8 billion), compared to 14,980 homes ($4.1 billion) for the same quarter of fiscal year 2005. Net sales orders for the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 increased 6% to 41,550 homes ($11.4 billion), compared to 39,282 homes ($10.9 billion) for the same period of fiscal year 2005.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our people worked very hard to achieve these net sales orders given the difficult selling conditions the homebuilding industry is experiencing. The current home sales environment is characterized by an increase in both existing and new homes available for sale, higher than normal cancellation rates and an increase in the use of sales incentives in many of our markets. Due to these market conditions, we expect earnings for the third quarter ended June 30, 2006 to be approximately $0.93 per diluted share, which reflects approximately $0.11 per diluted share in writeoffs of earnest money and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts. We are reducing our guidance for fiscal year 2006 to $3.65 per diluted share or greater on approximately 50,000 homes closed."
The Company will provide additional information about the third quarter results and its expectations for fiscal year 2006 in its July 20, 2006 press release and earnings conference call. The conference call will be held Thursday, July 20, 2006 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The dial-in number is 800-374-9096. Participants are encouraged to call in five minutes before the call begins (9:55 a.m. ET). Please reference the call host, Donald J. Tomnitz, CEO of D.R. Horton, Inc. The call will also be webcast from the Company's website at on the "Investor Relations" page.
