FORT WORTH, TEXAS
For the nine months ended June 30, 2006, net income increased 5% to $955.6 million ($3.02 per diluted share), compared to $906.7 million ($2.85 per diluted share) for the same period of fiscal year 2005. Consolidated revenue for the nine months increased 16% to $10.2 billion, from $8.8 billion for the same period of fiscal year 2005.Homes closed in the nine-month period increased 10% to 35,838 homes from 32,550 homes for the same period of fiscal year 2005.
As previously reported, net sales orders for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were 14,316 homes ($3.8 billion), compared to 14,980 homes ($4.1 billion) for the same quarter of fiscal year 2005. Net sales orders for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 increased 6% to 41,550 homes ($11.4 billion), compared to 39,282 homes ($10.9 billion) for the same period of fiscal 2005. The Company's backlog of homes under contract at June 30, 2006 increased 4% to 24,956 homes ($7.4 billion), compared to 23,916 homes ($7.0 billion) at June 30, 2005.
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our people have worked very hard to achieve these results during a time when selling conditions are very difficult in the homebuilding industry. We have experienced a changing home sales environment since the beginning of the calendar year, which
became more evident during our third quarter. As we indicated when we reported our net sales orders last week, the current home sales environment is characterized by an increase in both existing and new homes available for sale, higher than normal cancellation rates and an increase in the use of sales incentives in many of our markets. Due to these factors, last week we reduced our guidance for fiscal year 2006 to $3.65 per diluted share or greater (based on approximately 317 million diluted shares) on approximately 50,000 homes closed."
