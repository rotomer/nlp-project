 D.R. Horton, Inc.

FORT WORTH, TEXAS
Donald R.

Although our cancellation rate decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we continue to experience higher than normal cancellation rates and an increased use of sales incentives in many of our markets."
