Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our people worked hard to achieve these results during a time when conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging. We continued to focus on improving our strong balance sheet and reducing our inventory while managing our business profitably. We reduced our lot position to 297,000 lots owned and controlled, down 25% from our March 2006 peak of 396,000. We also reduced our number of homes under construction to approximately 26,000 homes, down 35% from our June 2006 peak of 40,000. Our disciplined balance sheet management and our continued profitability have resulted in $1.2 billion of positive cash flows from operations during the last six months."
