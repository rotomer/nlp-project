Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry continue to be challenging in most of our markets as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remain high, and further increases in the use of sales incentives continue to put pressure on profit margins. Our focus on managing our balance sheet in a disciplined manner resulted in positive cash flows from operations for the third consecutive quarter. We also improved our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capitalization, net of cash, to 40.9% from 43.9% a year ago."
