Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

(the "Company") entered into a Third Amendment (the "Third Amendment") to the Company's unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (as previously amended, the "Credit Facility" and together with the Third Amendment, the "Amended Credit Facility") dated December 16, 2005. The Third Amendment was entered into by and among the Company, the lenders, guarantors, administrative agent and others listed therein, with Wachovia Bank, National Association serving as Administrative Agent.  The effect of the Third Amendment was to eliminate a restriction that limited the Company's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to shareholders to an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Company's consolidated net income for the most recent full fiscal year ended prior to the date of such distribution. Under the Amended Credit Facility, the Company is permitted to make any such dividend or distribution to shareholders provided there is no payment default of principal, interest or other amounts payable under the Amended Credit Facility, the Company satisfies certain financial covenants contained therein and such dividend or distribution does not cause the Company not to be in compliance with such financial covenants.
