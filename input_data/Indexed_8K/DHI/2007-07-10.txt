Exhibit 99.1
 
D.R. HORTON, INC., AMERICA'S BUILDER, REPORTS NET SALES ORDERS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF
FISCAL YEAR 2007
- D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America's Builder, the largest homebuilder in the United States, Tuesday (July 10, 2007), reported net sales orders for the third quarter ended June 30, 2007 of 8,559 homes ($2.0 billion), compared to 14,316 homes ($3.8 billion) for the same quarter of fiscal year 2006. Net sales orders for the first nine months of fiscal year 2007 totaled 27,313 homes ($6.9 billion), compared to 41,550 homes ($11.4 billion) for the same period of fiscal year 2006. The Company's cancellation rate (sales orders cancelled divided by gross sales orders) for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was 38%.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Market conditions for new home sales declined in our June quarter as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remained high, and we expect the housing environment to remain challenging. We adjusted our sales prices as selling conditions deteriorated, and we continue to react quickly to market dynamics. We expect to report a profit from operations before impairments for the June 30, 2007 quarter. However, as a result of the factors mentioned above, we will realize significant asset impairments which will result in a loss for both the quarter and the nine months ended June 30, 2007."
The Company will release its third quarter results on July 26, 2007 before the market opens. The conference call will be held Thursday, July 26, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).

Horton, Inc. The call will also be webcast from the Company's website at the "Investor Relations" page.
