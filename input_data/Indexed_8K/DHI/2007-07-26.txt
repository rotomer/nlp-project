For the nine months ended June 30, 2007, the Company reported a net loss totaling $662.3 million, or $2.11 per diluted share. The nine-month results included pre-tax charges to cost of sales of $943.9 million for inventory impairments and $66.9 million for write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts that the Company does not intend to pursue. Additionally, the results included a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $425.6 million. Net income for the nine months ended June 30, 2006 was $955.6 million, or $3.02 per diluted share.

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry continue to be challenging as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remain at historically high levels, both as an absolute number and in terms of months' supply. Increased use of sales incentives continues to put pressure on profit margins. In addition, home price appreciation over the past few years, higher interest rates and tightened credit standards in the mortgage industry are all negatively impacting affordability. Even in the midst of this volatile housing market, we produced an operating profit before impairments this quarter and generated positive cash flow from operations for the fourth consecutive quarter.
"We believe that market conditions will continue to be challenging, and our quarter-end impairment evaluations incorporated our more cautious outlook for the industry. For the remainder of fiscal 2007, we will focus on generating cash, reducing inventory balances and paying down outstanding debt to maintain a strong balance sheet."
The Company will host a conference call on Thursday, July 26, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096, and the call will also be webcast from on the "Investor Relations" page.
