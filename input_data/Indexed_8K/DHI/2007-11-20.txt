The fiscal 2007 results included pre-tax charges to cost of sales of $1,222.2 million of inventory impairments and $107.3 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts that the Company does not intend to pursue.

Homebuilding revenue for fiscal 2007 totaled $11.1 billion, compared to $14.8 billion for fiscal 2006.Homes closed in fiscal 2007 totaled 41,370 homes, compared to 53,099 homes in fiscal 2006.
The Company's sales backlog of homes under contract at September 30, 2007 was 10,442 homes ($2.7 billion), compared to 18,125 homes ($5.2 billion) at September 30, 2006. As previously reported, net sales orders for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2007 totaled 6,374 homes ($1.3 billion), compared to 10,430 homes ($2.5 billion) for the same quarter of fiscal 2006. Net sales orders for fiscal 2007 totaled 33,687 homes ($8.2 billion), compared to 51,980 homes ($13.9 billion) for fiscal 2006.
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, Market conditions continued to decline in our September quarter as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remained high while pricing remained very competitive. We also experienced reduced mortgage availability due to tighter lending standards, and buyers continued to approach the home buying decision cautiously. We expect the housing environment to remain challenging.
"
"Despite these challenging conditions, we exceeded our goal of generating $1 billion of cash flow from operations for the fiscal year, and all of our regions generated profits before impairments and land option cost write-offs for both the quarter and the fiscal year. We reduced our homes in inventory by more than 7,000 homes during the quarter to fewer than 20,000 homes at September 30, 2007. Cash flow from operations totaled over $800 million for the quarter and more than $1.3 billion for fiscal 2007. We used the fourth quarter cash flow from operations primarily to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility from $750 million at June 30, 2007 to $150 million at September 30, 2007, and we ended the year with $228 million in homebuilding cash. Our debt reduction and cash position resulted in an improvement in our homebuilding net debt to total capitalization ratio to 40.2%.
"In fiscal 2008, we will continue to focus on reducing inventory, generating cash flow from operations, controlling costs and reducing outstanding debt as we work to adjust our land and lot inventory and our homes under construction to appropriate levels relative to housing demand. We will also continue to closely monitor any capital outlays for land and lot acquisition and development costs, and we expect to significantly reduce those capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. As we focus on inventory reduction and capital preservation, our goal for fiscal 2008 is to again generate at least $1 billion in cash flow from operations."
The Company will host a conference call Tuesday, November 20th at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096. The call will also be webcast from on the "Investor Relations" page.
