Net income for the same quarter of fiscal 2007 was $109.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Homebuilding revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled $1.7 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2007. Homes closed totaled 6,549 homes, compared to 10,202 homes in the year ago quarter.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS
The Company's sales order backlog of homes under contract at December 31, 2007 was 8,138 homes ($2.0 billion), compared to 16,694 homes ($4.7 billion), at December 31, 2006. Net sales orders for the quarter totaled 4,245 homes ($0.9 billion), compared to 8,771 homes ($2.3 billion) for the same quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company's cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was 44%.
The Company reported $558 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2007. The two main sources of cash from operating activities were a reduction in inventories of $476 million and a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of $278 million. The main use of cash in operating activities was a reduction in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $296 million. In financing activities, cash was used to reduce the balance on the homebuilding revolving credit facility from $150 million to $0, repay the $215 million senior notes which matured in December 2007 and reduce financial services debt by $282 million, for a total of $647 million of debt reductions during the quarter.

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, Market conditions remained challenging in our December quarter as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remained high while pricing remained very competitive. Lending standards continue to be more restrictive than during the previous year, and buyers continued to approach the home buying decision cautiously. We expect the housing environment to remain challenging.
"
"Despite these challenging conditions, we continue to focus on reducing inventory, generating cash flow from operations, controlling costs and reducing outstanding debt as we work to adjust our inventories to appropriate levels relative to housing demand. We reduced both our owned lots and our homes in residential inventory by more than 10% from September 30, 2007. As we focus on inventory reduction and capital preservation, our goal for fiscal 2008 is to generate at least $1 billion in cash flow from operations. We made an excellent start on this goal by generating over $550 million in cash flow from operations in our first quarter, primarily driven by $476 million in cash generated by reducing our inventories."
