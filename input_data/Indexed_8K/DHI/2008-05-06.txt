Donald R.

We reduced our homes in residential inventory to approximately 15,100 homes at the end of March, down approximately 13% from the end of December. We generated approximately $450 million of cash flow from operations this quarter and exceeded our fiscal year goal of at least $1 billion in only six months. We ended the quarter with a homebuilding cash balance of $519 million. We also maintained our focus on controlling our costs, reducing our homebuilding SG&A expenses by approximately $88 million in our quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared to the year ago quarter."
