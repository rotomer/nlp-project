     On May 21, 2008, D.R. Horton, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the commencement of an offer to exchange any and all of its outstanding 9.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 (the "Existing Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $113.5 million for newly issued 9.75% Senior Notes due 2010 (the "New Notes"). In conjunction with the exchange offer, the Company is soliciting consents to an amendment to the indenture governing the Existing Notes that would eliminate many of the restrictive covenants applicable to the Existing Notes, including the restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments. The terms applicable to the New Notes will be substantially similar to the Existing Notes except that the New Notes and related guarantees will be senior obligations and the covenants of the New Notes will be substantially similar to other series of the Company's senior notes currently outstanding.
     The exchange offer is being made pursuant to an Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated May 21, 2008, and a related Letter of Transmittal and Consent. The consent solicitation is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, June 4, 2008, unless otherwise extended or earlier terminated. The exchange offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Thursday, June 19, 2008, unless otherwise extended or earlier terminated. If the exchange offer is consummated, each $1,000 of Existing Notes tendered and accepted will be exchanged for $1,000 of New Notes. A cash payment equal to $10 for each $1,000 in principal amount of Existing Notes will be paid to each holder of the Existing Notes who validly tenders notes and delivers a consent prior to the expiration of the consent solicitation.
     The exchange offer and consent solicitation are conditioned upon, among other things, receipt of tenders from, and consents to, the proposed amendments to the Existing Notes indenture from holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Existing Notes and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.
     A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
     This communication is not an offer to exchange any Existing Notes for New Notes, a solicitation of an offer to exchange any Existing Notes for New Notes, a solicitation of consents with respect to the Existing Notes, an offer to sell any New Notes or the solicitation of an offer to buy any New Notes.
