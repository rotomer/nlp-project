As a result of a competitive request for proposal process undertaken by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of D.R.

The decision to change the Company's principal independent accountants was approved by the Audit Committee on June 5, 2008.

The reports of E&Y on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007 and the subsequent period through June 5, 2008, there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y would have caused them to make reference thereto in E&Y's reports on the financial statements of the Company for such fiscal years.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007 and the subsequent period through June 5, 2008, there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).

The decision to change the Company's principal independent accountants was the result of a competitive request for proposal process undertaken by the Audit Committee.
