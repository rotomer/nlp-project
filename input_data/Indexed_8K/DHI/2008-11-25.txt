Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, Market conditions in the homebuilding industry deteriorated during our fourth fiscal quarter and October, characterized by rising foreclosures, high inventory levels of both new and existing homes, increasing unemployment and eroding consumer confidence. We continue to adjust our business to the current homebuilding environment by reducing our homes under construction and our owned lot position, controlling costs and repaying debt.
"
"We have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of the past nine quarters, and we will continue to focus on maintaining our strong liquidity position and balance sheet. We plan to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2009, in addition to the cash provided by our expected $622 million tax refund."

During the fourth quarter, the Company changed its operating segments from operating regions to operating divisions. As a result of this change, the composition of the Company's reporting segments was also revised. The California markets, which were previously presented as a separate reporting segment, are now included in the West reporting segment. Additionally, the Salt Lake City, Utah market, which was previously included in the Southwest reporting segment, is now included in the West reporting segment. The name of the Northeast reporting segment has been changed to the East reporting segment, although the markets comprising it remain the same. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. The changes in reporting segments have no effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented.

All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

costs and repaying debt. The forward-looking statements also include our continued focus on maintaining our strong liquidity position and balance sheet and our plan to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal year 2009 in addition to the cash provided by our expected $622 million tax refund.
