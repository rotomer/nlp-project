The Company's sales order backlog of homes under contract at December 31, 2008 was 4,006 homes ($0.9 billion), compared to 8,138 homes ($2.0 billion), at December 31, 2007.

The Company's cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 38%.
The Company's homebuilding cash balance at December 31, 2008 was $1.9 billion, which includes the receipt of a federal income tax refund of $621.7 million in December 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $817.6 million.
In the first quarter, the Company repurchased a total of $136.1 million principal amount of its outstanding notes for a total purchase price of $129.7 million, plus accrued interest.

Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry continued to deteriorate during our first fiscal quarter, characterized by rising foreclosures, high inventory levels of both new and existing homes, increasing unemployment, tight credit for homebuyers and eroding consumer confidence. We continue to adjust our business to the current homebuilding environment by reducing our homes under construction and our owned lot position, controlling costs and repaying debt.
"We have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of the past ten quarters, and we will continue to focus on maintaining our strong liquidity position and balance sheet. We plan to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2009, in addition to the cash provided by any federal income tax refunds."
The Company will host a conference call today (Tuesday, February 3rd) at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096, and the call will also be webcast from on the "Investor Relations" page.
