Indemnification
          (a) The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the directors, officers, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (collectively, the ""), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Issuers may otherwise have.
Underwriter Indemnified Parties
          (b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter Indemnified Party, based upon the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Issuers, the Underwriters shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing and the Issuers shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter Indemnified Party
 
unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Issuers, (ii) the Issuers shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter Indemnified Party and the Issuers and such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuers (in which case the Issuers shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Issuers shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriter Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by Citi and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Issuers shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without the Company's written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Issuers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter Indemnified Parties, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Underwriter Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Underwriter Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Underwriter Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
          (c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, their directors, their officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Issuers within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to the Underwriter Indemnified Parties but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information. In case any action shall be brought against the Issuers, any of their directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Issuers based on the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Issuers (except that if the Issuers shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Issuers, their directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Issuers shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters, by Section 7(b) hereof.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
 
as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the compensation received by the Underwriters (based on discount to investors on resale), bear to the sum of such total net proceeds and such compensation. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
          (e) The Underwriters confirm and the Issuers acknowledge that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Securities by the Underwriters set forth in the third paragraph, the eleventh paragraph and the twelfth paragraph of the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement and any written information provided by or on behalf of an Underwriter as to itself in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information for all purposes under this Agreement.

     (c) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to such Closing Date, there shall not have been any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any Issuer's debt by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act.
     (d) (i) Since the date of the latest balance sheet included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there shall not have been any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, affairs or business prospects, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) since the date of the latest balance sheet included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock or in the long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries from that set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and (iii) the Company and its subsidiaries shall have no liability or obligation, direct or contingent, which is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (A) borrowings or obligations arising from sales or repurchases of mortgages by the subsidiaries engaged in the financial services segment in the ordinary course of business and (B) those set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.

     (j) Each of the Securities to be issued on such Closing Date and the Underlying Shares related thereto shall have been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject only to notice of official issuance.

          9. . If any one Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Firm Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Firm Notes set forth opposite their names in hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Firm Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Firm Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Notes set forth in hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Firm Notes, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Firm Notes, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.

     (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
     (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
     (g) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
     (A) is for relief against the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary as debtor in an involuntary case,
     (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or a Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or
     (C) orders the liquidation of the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;
     (h) any Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee and the Indenture) or is declared null and void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or any Guarantor denies its liability under its Guarantee (other than by reason of release of a Guarantor from its Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Guarantee);
     (i) the failure by the Company to comply with the obligation to convert the Notes into Common Stock, cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock, as applicable, upon exercise of a Holder's conversion right and such failure continues for five days; or

          A Default as described in clause (c) above will not be deemed an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and (except in the case of a default with respect to Section 4.01) the Company does not cure the Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default." If such a Default is cured within such time period, it ceases.
     Section 5.02. .
Acceleration
          If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company resulting from Sections 5.01(f) or (g)) shall have occurred and be continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare all Notes to be due and payable immediately. Upon such declaration of acceleration, the amounts due and payable on the Notes will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in Sections 5.01(f) or (g) occurs, such an amount will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Trustee and the Company or any Holder.
ipso facto
          The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee and the Company may waive any Default or Event of Default (other than any Default or Event of Default in payment of principal or interest or Additional Interest, if any) on the Notes under the Indenture. Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequence (except an acceleration due to nonpayment of principal or interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on the Notes) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal) have been cured or waived. No such rescission shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent Event of Default, or shall impair any right or power consequent thereon.
     Section 5.03. .
Additional Interest
          (a) Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or in the Notes to the contrary, if the Company so elects, any failure to file reports as required under Section 3.01 will not result in the occurrence of an Event of Default until the expiration of the first 180 calendar days after the date (the "Specified Date") on which an Event of Default would otherwise occur as a result of any such failure (which would be the 120th calendar day after written notice is provided to the Company in accordance with Section 5.01(c)), that the Company pays Additional Interest on the Notes at an annual rate equal to (x) 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for the first 90 calendar days of such 180-day period and (y) 0.50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for the remaining 90 calendar days of such 180-day period. Additional Interest will be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date following the Specified Date in the same manner as regular interest on the Notes. On the 181st calendar day after the Specified Date (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), an Event of Default will be deemed to occur and the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 5.02. This Section 5.03(a) will not affect the rights of Holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. Whenever in the Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of payment of "Additional Interest" as provided for in this Section 5.03 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest, is, was or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of such sections, and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if applicable) shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions where such express mention is not made.
provided
 
          (b) In order to elect to pay Additional Interest relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations as required under Section 3.01, the Company must notify all Holders of Notes and the Trustee and Paying Agent of such election on or before the close of business on the 5th Business Day after the Specified Date. If the Company fails to timely give such notice or pay Additional Interest, the Notes will be immediately subject to acceleration as provided in Section 5.02.

Conversion Privilege
          Upon compliance with the provisions of this Article Six, a Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $2,000 principal amount or an integral multiple or $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Note prior to the close of business on the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, in each case, at an initial conversion rate (the "") of 76.5697 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6.04) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to the settlement provisions of Section 6.02, the "").

Conversion Procedure
          (a) Subject to this Section 6.02, upon any conversion of any Note, the Company will deliver to converting Holders, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, solely cash, solely shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock, at its election, as set forth in this Section 6.02 (the "").
Settlement Amount
     (i) All conversions on or after the 23rd Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date will be settled using the same Settlement Method.
     (ii) On any Conversion Date prior to the 23rd Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, the Company will elect (or be deemed to have elected) the same Settlement Method for all conversions occurring on such Conversion Date. Except for conversions that occur on or after the 23rd Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, the Company need not elect the same Settlement Method with respect to conversions that occur on different Trading Days.
     (iii) If, in respect of any Conversion Date (or the period beginning on, and including, the 23rd Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date and ending on, and including, the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, as the case may be), the Company elects to deliver a notice (the " of the relevant Settlement Method in respect of such Conversion Date (or such period, as the case may be), the Company, through the Trustee, shall deliver such Settlement Notice to converting Holders no later than the second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. Such Settlement Notice shall specify whether the Company shall satisfy its Conversion Obligation by (A) delivering solely shares of Common Stock, (B) paying solely cash or (C) paying and delivering, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. In the case of an election to pay and deliver, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, the relevant Settlement Notice shall indicate the Specified Dollar Amount. If the Company does not deliver a Settlement Notice, the Company will be deemed to have elected

to deliver a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of its Conversion Obligation, and the Specified Dollar Amount shall be deemed to be equal to $1,000. If the Company delivers a Settlement Notice electing to pay and deliver, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of its Conversion Obligation but does not indicate a Specified Dollar Amount in such Settlement Notice, the Specified Dollar Amount shall be deemed to be equal to $1,000.
     (iv) The Settlement Amount in respect of any conversion of Notes shall be computed as follows:
     (v) The Company will also deliver to each converting Holder cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to Section 6.02(j).
     (vi) The Daily Settlement Amounts (if applicable) and the Daily Conversion Values (if applicable) shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period. Promptly after such determination of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash deliverable in lieu of fractional shares (if any), the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash deliverable in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent shall have no responsibility for any such determination.
          (b) Before any Holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depository in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to the amount of interest (including Additional Interest, if any) payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 6.02(h) and, if required, all transfer or similar taxes, if any, and (ii) in the case of a Note issued in
 
certificated form, (1) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) ( hereto) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, pay funds equal to interest (including Additional Interest, if any) payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 6.02(h), (4) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (5) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any as set forth in Section 6.02(e). The Trustee (and if different, the relevant Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article Six on the date of such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Sections 7.01 and 7.02, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.
Exhibit C
Notice of Conversion
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
          (c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this Section 6.02. The Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, such cash and/or shares of Common Stock on the third Trading Day immediately following the last Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period; , that if the Company elects to fulfill its Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock, the Company shall deliver such Common Stock on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date; , , that if prior to the relevant Conversion Date, the Common Stock has been replaced by Reference Property consisting solely of cash, pursuant to Section 6.06(b), the Company shall pay such cash on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any information required to calculate the Conversion Obligation is not available as of the applicable settlement date, the Company will deliver the additional shares of Common Stock resulting from such adjustment on the third Trading Day after the earliest Trading Day on which such calculation can be made. If application of the provisions described above would result in settlement of a conversion during the ten Trading Days immediately following the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, settlement will instead take place on the tenth Trading Day following the relevant Effective Date. If any shares of Common Stock are due to converting Holders, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued, and deliver to the Conversion Agent or to such Holder, or such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depository for the number of full shares of Common Stock.

further
          (d) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such Holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note.
          (e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, that may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or tax-
 
ing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the Holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
          (f) Except as provided in Section 6.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
          (g) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
          (h) Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any additional cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations pursuant to Section 6.02 shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Interest Record Date, Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the Interest Record Date will receive the interest (including Additional Interest, if any) payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Interest Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest (including Additional Interest, if any) payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after an Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any, existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note or (3) if the Notes are surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as set forth in this Section 6.02(h), no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on converted Notes.
provided
however
          (i) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or the last Trading Day of the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method), as the case may be; , , if such Conversion Date or such last Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period occurs on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, such occurrence shall not be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive any such shares of Common Stock due upon conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such occurrence shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder.
provided
however
 
          (j) For each Note surrendered for conversion, if the Company has elected to deliver a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of its Conversion Obligation, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Cash Settlement Averaging Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be paid in cash. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof (and the number of fractional shares remaining) shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead, the Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Daily VWAP on the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or based on the Daily VWAP on the last Trading Day of the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method).

     (ii) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $50.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), or if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $10.79 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment shall be equal to zero and this Section 6.03 shall not require the Company to increase the Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;
     (iii) if an event occurs that requires, pursuant to this Article Six (other than solely pursuant to this Section 6.03), an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, then, on the date and at the time such adjustment is so required to be made, each price set forth in the table above under the row titled "Stock Price" shall be deemed to be adjusted so that such Stock Price, at and after such time, shall be equal to the product of (1) such Stock Price as in effect immediately before such adjustment to such Stock Price and (2) a fraction whose numerator is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before such adjustment to the Conversion Rate and whose denominator is the Conversion Rate to be in effect, in accordance with this Article Six, immediately after such adjustment to the Conversion Rate;
     (iv) each Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment set forth in the table above shall be adjusted in the same manner in which, at the same time and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is to be adjusted pursuant to Section 6.04; and

          (b) As soon as practicable after the Company determines the anticipated Effective Date of any proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall mail to each Holder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice of, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, the anticipated Effective Date of such proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in time to give such notice fifty Business Days in advance of such anticipated Effective Date. Each such press release notice, announcement and publication shall also state that in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall increase, in accordance herewith, the Conversion Rate applicable to Notes entitled as provided herein to such increase (along with a description of how such increase shall be calculated and the time periods during which Notes must be surrendered in order to be entitled to such increase). No later than five Business Days after the actual Effective Date of each Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall mail to each Holder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice of, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, such Effective Date and the amount by which the Conversion Rate has been so increased.
 
     Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 6.04 in respect of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
     Section 6.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
          (a) If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all of the shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of the Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     where,
Such adjustment will become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 6.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
          (b) If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than sixty days from the record date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
     where,
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not been fixed.
     For purposes of this Section 6.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the Holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for each Trading Day in the applicable ten consecutive Trading Day period, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 6.04(b).
          (c) If the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other of its assets or property other than (i) dividends or distributions (including share splits) covered by Section 6.04(a) or Section 6.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 6.04(c) shall apply to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
     where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.04(c) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company and such Capital Stock distributed to holders of the Company's Common Stock is or is to be traded or quoted on an exchange or quotation system (a ""), the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
     where,
 
     The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph of this Section 6.04(c) shall be made immediately after the opening of business on the day after the last day of the Valuation Period, but shall become effective as of the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off is less than ten Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion references within this Section 6.04(c) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of determining the applicable Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten Trading Days commencing on the Ex-Dividend Date of any Spin-Off, references in the portion of this Section 6.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the Conversion Date for such conversion.
     Subject in all respect to Section 6.10, rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 6.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 6.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 6.04(c). If any such rights, options or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 6.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
     For purposes of this Section 6.04(c), Section 6.04(a), and Section 6.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 6.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 6.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, options or war-
 
rants to which Section 6.04(c) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 6.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, options or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 6.04(a) and Section 6.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Ex-Dividend Date," "the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution of such rights, options or warrants" and "the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 6.04(a) and Section 6.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 6.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution" within the meaning of Section 6.04(b).
     In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 6.04(c).
          (d) If any cash dividend or distribution in excess of $0.0375 per share in any fiscal quarter (the "") is made to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Initial Dividend Threshold
     where,
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     The Initial Dividend Threshold is subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate, that no adjustment will be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate under this Section 6.04(d).
provided
     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 6.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 6.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Prices of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of
 
each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 6.04(d).
          (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
     where,
Such adjustment under this Section 6.04(e) shall become effective at the opening of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. If the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date is less than ten Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this Section 6.04(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of determining the applicable Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references within this Section 6.04(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date
 
to, but excluding, the Conversion Date for such conversion. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 6.04(e).
          (f) Except with respect to a Spin-Off, in cases where the Fair Market Value of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property or the amount of cash dividend or distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock, distributed to all, or substantially all, stockholders:
     (i) equals or exceeds the average Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution; or
     (ii) such average Last Reported Sale Prices exceeds the Fair Market Value of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property or the amount of cash so distributed by less than $1.00,
rather than being entitled to an adjustment in the Conversion Rate, the Holder of a Note will be entitled to receive upon conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, cash or combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, the kind and amount of shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property or cash comprising the distribution, if any, that such Holder would have received if such Holder had held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the principal amount of the Notes held, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the Record Date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.
divided by
          (g) The term "" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock (or other security) have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
          (h) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right, option or warrant to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
          (i) Notwithstanding this Section 6.04 or Section 6.06(c) or any other provision of the Indenture or the Notes, if any Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective, or any Record Date or Ex-Dividend Date for any issuance, dividend or distribution (relating to a required Conversion Rate adjustment) occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the open of business on a Conversion Date and ending on, and including, (x) the close of business on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or (y) the close of business on the last Trading Day of a related Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method), the Board of Directors shall make adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, as are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 6.04, 6.06(c) and the other provisions of this Article Six and to avoid unjust or inequitable
 
results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (whose good faith determination shall be conclusive). Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 6.04(i) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment or other term that would otherwise be applicable.
          (j) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing in the registration books of the Registrar a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
          (k) The Company shall not take any action that would result in adjustment of the Conversion Rate, pursuant to this Article Six, in such a manner as to result in the reduction of the Conversion Price to less than the par value per share of Common Stock.
          (l) The applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
     (i) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of the Common Stock under any plan;
     (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
     (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the Issue Date;
     (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
     (v) for accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any; or
     (vi) for any transactions described in this Section 6.04 if Holders participate (as a result of holding the Notes, and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in such transactions as if such Holders held a number shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate at the time such adjustment would be required, multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder, without having to convert their Notes.
          (m) All calculations and other determinations under this Article Six shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
 
          (n) The Company will not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) upon any conversion of Notes, and (ii) on each of the twenty-two Scheduled Trading Days immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
          (o) Except as set forth in this Article Six, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate.
          (p) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall issue a press release containing the relevant information and make this information available on its website. In addition, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a responsible officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing in the registration books of the Registrar, within ten days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
          (q) If, in respect of any Trading Day within the Cash Settlement Averaging Period for a converted Note:
     (i) the Company elects to satisfy its conversion obligation through delivery of a combination of cash and Common Stock and such shares of Common Stock are deliverable with respect to the Daily Settlement Amount for such Trading Day in accordance with this Article Six;
     (ii) any event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under any of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.04 has not yet resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as of such Trading Day; and
     (iii) the shares of Common Stock the Holder of such Note shall receive in respect of such Trading Day are not entitled to participate in the distribution or transaction giving rise to such adjustment event because, pursuant to the terms of Section 6.02(i), such shares were not held by such Holder on the Record Date corresponding to such distribution or transaction or otherwise,
     then, without duplication of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate set forth under any of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.04, the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable with respect to the Daily Settlement Amount for such Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
          (r) If:
     (i) the Company elects to satisfy the Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock;
 
     (ii) any event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under any of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.04 has not resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as of the Conversion Date; and
     (iii) the shares of Common Stock the Holder of such Note shall receive on settlement are not entitled to participate in the distribution or transaction giving rise to such adjustment event because, pursuant to the terms of Section 6.02(i), such shares were not held by such Holder on the Record Date corresponding to such distribution or transaction or otherwise,
     then, without duplication of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate set forth under any of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.04, the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable with respect to the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
          (s) For purposes of this Section 6.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
          (t) The Company shall be entitled to reduce or otherwise set-off against any payments made or deemed made by the Company to Holders in respect of the Notes or the Common Stock for any amounts the company believes it is required to withhold by law. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company pays any withholding taxes on behalf of Holders as a result of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate of the Notes, the Company may, at its option, set-off such payments against payments of cash or Common Stock in respect of the Notes. In the case of any such set-off against shares of Common Stock delivered upon any conversion of the Notes, such shares of Common Stock shall be valued at the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of payment of cash or delivery shares of Common Stock as provided in Section 6.02(c). Any amounts withheld pursuant to this clause (t) shall be paid over by the Company to the appropriate taxing authority.
     Section 6.05. .
Shares to Be Fully Paid
     The Company will provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
     Section 6.06. .
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     Upon the occurrence of (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination covered by Section 6.04(a)), (ii) any consolidation, merger, combination or binding share exchange involving the Company, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a ""), then:
Significant Transaction
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture
 
Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under and compliant with the provisions set forth in the Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article Six. If, in the case of any Significant Transaction, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation or other legal entity other than the successor or purchasing entity, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other entity and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article Seven.
          In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 6.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Significant Transaction, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the registration books of the Registrar, within twenty days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.02(a), and subject to the provisions of Section 6.01 and Section 6.03, at and after the effective time of such Significant Transaction, (i) the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes into cash,             shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock at the Company's election as set forth in Section 6.02 will be changed to a right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of such Note into cash, the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration (the "") or a combination of cash and Reference Property at the Company's election and (ii) the related Conversion Obligation shall be settled pursuant to clause (c) below.
Reference Property
     (c) With respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes surrendered for conversion after the effective date of any such Significant Transaction, the Company's Conversion Obligation shall be settled in cash or units of Reference Property, at the Company's election, in accordance with Section 6.02(b) as follows:
     (i) (A) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by delivering solely Reference Property, the Company shall deliver to the converting Holder a number of units of Reference Property (each such unit comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Significant Transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration) equal to (1) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted, divided by $1,000, multiplied by (2) the then-applicable Conversion Rate; (B) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by paying solely cash, the Company shall pay to the converting
 
Holder cash in an amount, per $1,000 principal amount of Notes equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the twenty consecutive Trading Days during the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period; and (C) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation through delivery of a combination of cash and Reference Property, the Company shall deliver in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, a Settlement Amount equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the twenty consecutive Trading Days during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period for such Note, , that in each case, within any of the definitions used to determine the amount of cash or units of Reference Property to be delivered in order to satisfy the Company's Conversion Obligation pursuant to this Section 6.06, all references to the term "Common Stock" shall be read as if the reference to "Common Stock" were instead a reference to "Reference Property," and references to a "share" or "shares" of "Common Stock" shall be read as a "unit" or "units" of "Reference Property," as applicable (each such unit comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Significant Transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration).
provided
     (ii) The Company will deliver the cash in lieu of fractional units of Reference Property as set forth pursuant to Section 6.02(j) ( that the amount of such cash shall be determined as if references in such Section to "Common Stock" were instead a reference to "Reference Property," and references to a "share" or "shares" of "Common Stock" shall be read as a "unit" or "units" of "Reference Property," as applicable (each such unit comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Significant Transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration).
provided
     (iii) The Daily Settlement Amounts (if applicable) and Daily Conversion Values (if applicable) shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
     (iv) For purposes of this Section 6.06, the "" means the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock in any Significant Transaction who affirmatively make such an election.
Weighted Average Consideration
     (v) The Company shall notify the Holders and the Trustee of the Weighted Average Consideration as soon as practicable after the Weighted Average Consideration is determined.
          (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Significant Transactions.
          (e) In the event that the Notes become convertible into Reference Property pursuant to this Section 6.06, the Company shall notify the Trustee and issue a press release containing the relevant information (and make such press release available on the Company's website).
 
     Section 6.07. .
Certain Covenants
          (a) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
          (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
          (c) The Company covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any national or regional securities exchange, the Company will list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
     Section 6.08. .
Responsibility of Trustee
     The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as the initial Conversion Agent, which appointment the Trustee accepts and agrees to perform in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent ("") shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any Notes, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 6.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 6.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.02 of the Base Indenture, may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including without limitation its right to be compensated, reimbursed, and indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, including its capacity as Conversion Agent.

Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
     In case:
 
     (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 6.04; or
     (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights, options or warrants; or
     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company; the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing in the registration books of the Registrar as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for Notes or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
     Section 6.10. .
Stockholder Rights Plans
     To the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan or other "poison pill" in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each share of Common Stock, if any, issued upon such conversion shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any such stockholder rights plan or poison pill, as the same may be amended from time to time. If, however, prior to the time of conversion, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that the Holders of the Notes would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company has distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock of the Company, evidence of indebtedness or assets as provided in Section 6.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
     Section 6.11. .
Exchange in Lieu of Conversion
     When a Holder surrenders its Notes for conversion, the Company may, at its election, direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior to the second Business Day following the relevant Conversion Date, such Notes to a financial institution designated by the Company (the "") for exchange in lieu of conversion. In order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion for exchange in lieu of conversion, the Designated Institution must agree to timely deliver, in exchange for such Notes, the shares of Common stock and/or cash that would otherwise be due upon conversion pursuant to Sec-
Designated Institution
 
tion 6.02 and in respect of which the Company has notified converting Holders. If the Company makes the election provided for in this Section 6.11, the Company shall, by the close of business on the second Business Day following the relevant Conversion Date as part of its Settlement Notice, notify the Holder surrendering its Notes for conversion that it has made such election. In addition, the Company shall concurrently notify the Designated Institution of the Settlement Method (and, if applicable, the Specified Dollar Amount) that Company has elected with respect to such conversion and the relevant deadline for delivery of the consideration due upon conversion. Any Notes exchanged by the Designated Institution will remain outstanding.
     If the Designated Institution agrees to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration due upon conversion to the Conversion Agent, or if the Designated Institution does not accept such Notes for exchange, the Company shall, within the time period specified in Section 6.02(c), convert such Notes into cash and/or shares of Common Stock, as applicable in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.02.
     For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Company's designation of a Designated Institution pursuant to this Section 6.11 require the Designated Institution to accept any Notes for exchange.

Note Documents
     We have examined the originals, or photostatic or certified copies, of such records of the Company and the Guarantors and certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantors and of public officials and such other documents as we have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed that each of the parties to the Note Documents other than the Company (including, without limitation, the Guarantors) is a validly existing corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company in good standing under the laws of its state of formation and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Note Documents to which it is a party, and the execution and delivery of such Note Documents by such party and performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not violate any order, judgment or decree applicable to such party.
     Based upon the foregoing examination, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the foregoing assumptions and the qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
     1. When the Notes and the Guarantees shall have been executed and authenticated as provided in the Indenture and sold as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, the Notes and the Guarantees will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively.
     2. When issued upon conversion of the Notes as provided in the Indenture, the Shares will be legally issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
     The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions:
     A. The effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Act will not have been terminated or rescinded.
     B. We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the State of New York and the United States of America and, (ii) for the purposes of paragraph 2 above, the Delaware General Corporation Law. We are not admitted to practice in the State of Delaware; however, we are generally familiar with the Delaware General Corporation Law as currently in effect and have made such inquiries as we consider necessary to render the opinion contained in paragraph 2 above. This opinion is limited to the effect of the current state of the laws of the States of New
 
D.R. Horton, Inc. May 12, 2009 Page 3
York and the United States of America and, to the limited extent set forth above, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the facts as they currently exist. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement our opinions in the event of future changes in such laws or the interpretations thereof or such facts. We express no opinion regarding the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 or any other federal or state securities laws or regulations.
     C. Our opinions are subject to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally (including the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers) and (ii) general principles of equity, including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
     D. We express no opinion regarding the effectiveness of (i) any waiver of stay, extension or usury laws or of unknown future rights or (ii) provisions relating to indemnification or contribution, to the extent such provisions may be contrary to public policy or federal or state securities laws.
     We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement and the prospectus that forms a part thereof.
