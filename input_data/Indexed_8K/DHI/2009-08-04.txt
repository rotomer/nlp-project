The Company's sales order backlog of homes under contract at June 30, 2009 was 5,430 homes ($1.1 billion), compared to 8,281 homes ($1.9 billion) at June 30, 2008.

The Company has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0375 per share. The dividend is payable on August 28, 2009 to stockholders of record on August 19, 2009.
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our net sales orders in the June quarter reflected a 22% sequential increase from our March quarter which was stronger than our usual seasonal trend. However, market conditions in the homebuilding industry are still challenging, characterized by rising foreclosures, high inventory levels of available homes, increasing unemployment, tight credit for homebuyers and weak consumer confidence. We have continued to adjust our business to the current homebuilding environment by reducing our owned lot position and completed specs, controlling costs and strengthening our balance sheet.
"We have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of the past twelve quarters, and our unrestricted homebuilding cash balance was $1.97 billion at June 30, 2009. Our net homebuilding debt to total capitalization was 34.5% at the end of the quarter, and we will continue to focus on maintaining our strong liquidity position and balance sheet."
The Company will host a conference call today (Tuesday, August 4) at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096, and the call will also be webcast from on the "Investor Relations" page.
