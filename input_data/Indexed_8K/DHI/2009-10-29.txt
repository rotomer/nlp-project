.
On October 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established and approved the base salaries, performance-based bonus criteria, performance periods and other long-term compensation and benefits for Donald R. Horton, Chairman, and Donald J. Tomnitz, President and Chief Executive Officer, for our 2010 fiscal year ending September 30, 2010 Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz are expected to be two of our "named executive officers" (as defined in Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K) in our 2010 fiscal year. The primary components of the 2010 compensation program for each of Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz are set forth in Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and Exhibit 10.1 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
("2010 fiscal year").

Exhibit 10.1
.
2010 Fiscal Year Compensation Program of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Table I below sets forth the 2010 fiscal year base salaries for Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz.
2010 Fiscal Year Base Salaries:
Table I
2000 Amended and Restated Incentive Bonus Plan.
The Compensation Committee approved performance-based goals for measuring short-term performance bonuses that may be earned by Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz during the 2010 fiscal year. The 2010 performance goals were established under the Company's 2000 Amended and Restated Incentive Bonus Plan. The 2010 fiscal year performance goal for Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz relates to consolidated pre-tax income as set forth below.
2010 Fiscal Year Annual Performance Bonus:
Annual Performance Bonus  Performance related to Pre-Tax Income:
Under the 2010 fiscal year performance bonus program, each of Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz has the opportunity to earn the following performance-based bonus:
 
shall mean income before income taxes, as publicly reported by the Company in its quarterly or annual financial statements, as applicable, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The financial statements shall mean the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
"Pre-Tax Income"
The Compensation Committee reserves the right to pay any bonus hereunder in cash or equity or a combination of both and reserves the right to adjust downward, in part or in whole, the 2010 fiscal year performance bonus.
Other Long-Term Benefits.
Consistent with prior years, Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz may participate in two separate deferred compensation plans. The first plan allows the executive to make voluntary income deferrals. The second plan is a promise by the Company to pay retirement benefits to the executive. Furthermore, if the executive is employed by the Company on the last day of the current fiscal year (for example September 30, 2010), then the Company will establish a liability to him equal to 10% of his annual base salary as of the first day of the current fiscal year (for example October 1, 2009). This liability will accrue earnings in future years at a rate established by the administrative committee.
