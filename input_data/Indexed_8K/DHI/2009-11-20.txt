First Cash Component,
Second Cash and Equity Component,
("SG&A")
     Under the First Cash Component, Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz were each paid $340,014 related to adjusted pre-tax income achieved during the first quarter of the 2009 fiscal year (based on 6% of adjusted pre-tax income for the month of December). No bonuses were paid based on adjusted pre-tax income for the remaining three quarters in the 2009 fiscal year because no positive adjusted pre-tax income was achieved.
First Cash Component:
     Under the Second Cash and Equity Component, Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz were each paid a $2 million performance bonus. Approximately 60% of the bonus was related to the cash flow performance goal and approximately 40% was related to the SG&A containment performance goal. The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz achieved levels of performance related to the cash flow and SG&A containment goals to earn a maximum performance bonus of $4 million each under the terms of their performance bonus programs established at the beginning of the 2009 fiscal year. However, the Compensation Committee decided to exercise its discretion and reduced the $4 million potential bonus to $2 million for each of Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz. In deciding to reduce the bonus, the Compensation Committee took into consideration the consolidated financial results of the Company and the continued challenges facing the homebuilding industry.
