     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "We are excited to report a quarterly pre-tax profit of $42.8 million and net income of $192.0 million. Our homes closed increased 36% over the prior year while our homes gross margin improved 460 basis points sequentially to 17.1%. Our homebuilding SG&A dollars increased only 1% from the year ago quarter while homebuilding revenues increased 23%, bringing our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues down to 11.6%. Our balance sheet remains strong with a homebuilding cash balance of $1.9 billion and net homebuilding leverage improving to 28.0%.
     "Our net sales orders also showed significant improvement from the year ago quarter, increasing 45%. Our focus on providing affordable homes positioned us to take advantage of the demand created by the federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers, and we believe that the extension of the tax credit will benefit our spring selling season.
 
     "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry are still challenging, characterized by rising foreclosures, high inventory levels of available homes, increasing unemployment, tightening FHA lending standards and weak consumer confidence. However, new home inventory remains low, interest rates are favorable and housing affordability is near record highs. We will continue to focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time buyer, controlling our costs, contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots and maintaining our strong balance sheet."
     The Company will host a conference call today (Tuesday, February 2nd) at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The dial-in number is 800-374-9096, and the call will also be webcast from on the "Investor Relations" page.

The Company will file a Form 8-K to reflect the effects of this accounting change on the Company's previously filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, following the filing of this quarter's Form 10-Q.

All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
 
future events or otherwise.

They forward-looking statements also include our continued focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time buyer, controlling our costs, contracting for communities with attractively priced finished lots and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions, such as increasing unemployment and worsening of consumer confidence; the continuing constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of expiring government programs, such as the homebuyer federal tax credit and the Fed's open market purchases of mortgage-backed securities, both scheduled to end in 2010; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; a return of an inflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulations on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred tax asset; and the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
