Our homes closed increased 19% over the prior year while our homes gross margin improved 90 basis points sequentially to 18.0%. Our homebuilding SG&A dollars increased only 1% from the year ago quarter while homebuilding revenues increased 16%. Our balance sheet remains strong with homebuilding cash and marketable securities of $1.8 billion and net homebuilding leverage improving to 22.2%.
 
"Our focus on providing affordable homes enabled us to take advantage of the spring selling season demand, resulting in 6,438 net sales orders for the quarter, an increase of 55% from the year ago quarter and 59% sequentially.
"Market conditions in the homebuilding industry are still challenging, with rising foreclosures, significant existing home inventory levels, high unemployment, tight mortgage lending standards, the expiration of certain government support for the housing and mortgage markets and weak consumer confidence. However, new home inventory remains low, interest rates are favorable and housing affordability is near record highs. We will continue to focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time buyer, controlling our costs and contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots while maintaining our strong balance sheet."

Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; the continuing constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of expiring government programs, such as the homebuyer federal tax credit scheduled to end in our third quarter of fiscal 2010; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; a return of an inflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred tax asset; and the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
