Our homes closed increased 60% over the prior year and our homes gross margin improved 590 basis points. Our homebuilding SG&A dollars increased only 7% from the year ago quarter while supporting a 51% increase in homebuilding revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong with homebuilding cash and marketable securities of $1.7 billion and net homebuilding leverage improving to 17.5%. Including our debt repurchases subsequent to quarter-end and the scheduled maturities in September, our total principal repayments in fiscal 2010 will be more than $1 billion.
     "As we expected, market conditions in the homebuilding industry have become more challenging after the expiration of the tax credit at the end of April. Our net sales orders declined significantly in May and improved modestly in June and July. However, we will continue to focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time buyer, controlling our costs and contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots while maintaining our strong balance sheet."
