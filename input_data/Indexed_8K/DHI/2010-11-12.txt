We will continue to focus on providing affordable homes, controlling our costs and contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots.
     "We have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of the past seventeen quarters, and our homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2010, even after retiring over $1 billion of debt during the fiscal year. Our net homebuilding debt to total capitalization decreased to 16.1% at the end of the fiscal year, and we will continue to focus on maintaining our strong liquidity position and balance sheet."

All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R.

Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; the continuing constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of government programs; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; the impact of an inflationary or deflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred income tax asset; and the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
