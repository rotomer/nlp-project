     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "We are proud of the results our team achieved this quarter. Sequentially, our homebuilding revenues grew $242 million, home sales gross margins improved by 30 basis points and homebuilding SG&A decreased by approximately $10 million. Additionally, our net sales orders in the June quarter were about flat with the March quarter, reflecting a traditional seasonal demand pattern. Our results for the first nine months of the fiscal year, combined with our backlog of 5,600 homes and our inventory of homes available for sale, have positioned us to be profitable for the full fiscal year.
     "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry are still challenging, with high foreclosures, significant existing home inventory, high unemployment, tight mortgage lending standards and weak consumer confidence, which are all contributing to weak housing demand. However, housing affordability remains near record highs, interest rates are favorable and new home inventory is still very low. We continue to focus on providing new homes and communities for both first-time and move-up buyers, controlling our construction costs, SG&A and inventory levels and maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity."

Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements in this release include our expectation that our results for the first nine months of the fiscal year, combined with our backlog of 5,600 homes and our inventory of homes available for sale, have positioned us to be profitable for the full fiscal year.

Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; the continuing constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of government programs; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; the impact of an inflationary or deflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants,
 
restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred income tax asset; and our ability to utilize our tax losses, which could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
