     Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our strategy to open new communities for first-time and move-up buyers, improve gross margins, adjust our overhead and reduce interest expense led to our second consecutive year of profitability, despite continued challenging market conditions. In fiscal 2011, we reduced our homebuilding SG&A expense by $43 million and our homebuilding interest expensed directly and amortized to cost of sales by $67 million. Positive sales comparisons in our third and fourth quarters contributed to an 18% increase in our sales order backlog, positioning us for a stronger start to fiscal 2012. We will continue to control our construction costs, SG&A and inventory levels, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we look forward to another year of profitability in fiscal 2012."
     The Company will host a conference call today (Friday, November 11th) at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. The dial-in number is 877-407-8033, and the call will also be webcast from on the "Investors" page.

     Portions of this document may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements in this release include that our 18% increase in our sales order backlog positions us for a stronger start to fiscal 2012. The forward-looking statements also include that we will continue to control our construction costs, SG&A and inventory levels, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity and that we look forward to another year of profitability in fiscal 2012. Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; the continuing constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of government programs; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; the impact of an inflationary or deflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry;
 
our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred income tax asset; and our ability to utilize our tax losses, which could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
