D.R. HORTON, INC., AMERICA'S BUILDER, REPORTS FISCAL 2012 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AND DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
 D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America's Builder, today reported that net income for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2012 increased 46% to $40.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, from $27.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the same quarter of fiscal 2011. Homebuilding revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 28% to $935.6 million from $733.1 million in the same quarter of 2011. Homes closed in the quarter increased 21% to 4,240, compared to 3,516 homes in the year ago quarter.
FORT WORTH, TEXAS
For the six months ended March 31, 2012, net income increased to $68.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, from $7.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2011. Homebuilding revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2012 increased 21% to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2011. Homes closed in the six-month period increased 17% to 8,358 homes, compared to 7,153 homes in the same period of fiscal 2011.
Net sales orders for the second quarter ended March 31, 2012 increased 19% to 5,899 homes from 4,943 homes in the year ago quarter and the value of net sales orders increased 28% to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion. The Company's cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders) for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was 22%. Net sales orders for the first six months of fiscal 2012 increased 17% to 9,693 homes from 8,306 homes in the first six months of fiscal 2011, and the value of net sales orders increased 23% to $2.1 billion from $1.7 billion.
The Company's sales order backlog of homes under contract at March 31, 2012 increased 17% to 6,189 homes from 5,281 homes at March 31, 2011. The value of the backlog increased 25% to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2012 from $1.1 billion a year ago.
The Company ended the quarter with $961.3 million of homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities and net homebuilding debt to total capital of 18.9%. Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities.
The Company expects stronger closings and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year, consistent with traditional seasonal trends. Its current expectation for home sales gross margin is that it will remain in the mid-16% to mid-17% range. Homebuilding SG&A expense is expected to increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to variable components; however, homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues should improve as the Company closes more homes and continues to leverage its fixed cost structure. Additionally, if the Company's current business trends continue, it expects to be out of its three-year cumulative loss position before the end of the fiscal year. The Company may be able to significantly reduce the valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset at some point in the next few quarters if its business, the homebuilding industry and economic conditions remain stable.
The Company has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0375 per share. The dividend is payable on May 22, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 8, 2012.
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "Our homebuilding and financial services segments delivered strong operating results in our second quarter, and our strong sales pace has continued through the first half of April. Each of our regions reported increases in sales and pre-tax income compared to last year. Our net income in the second quarter increased 46%, and our sales, closings and backlog all increased year-over-year by double-digit percentages. Our homes closed increased 21% from the year ago quarter, while homebuilding SG&A only increased 3% as we leveraged our fixed cost structure. We ended the quarter with almost $1 billion in homebuilding cash and marketable securities, even after increasing our homes in inventory and investing in land and lots. These results reflect that we are using our strong operating position to profitably grow our business in the current housing environment."
The Company will host a conference call today (Monday, April 23rd) at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The dial-in number is 877-407-8033, and the call will also be webcast from the Company's website at on the "Investors" page.

Portions of this document may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date this release was issued. D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements in this release include that the Company expects stronger closings and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year, consistent with traditional seasonal trends; its current expectation for home sales gross margin is that it will remain in the mid-16% to mid-17% range; homebuilding SG&A expense is expected to increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to variable components; however, homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues should improve as the Company closes more homes and continues to leverage its fixed cost structure; if the Company's current business trends continue, it expects to be out of its three-year cumulative loss position before the end of the fiscal year; and it may be able to significantly reduce its valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset at some point in the next few quarters if its business, the homebuilding industry and economic conditions remain stable. The forward-looking statements also include that we are using our strong operating position to profitably grow our business in the current housing environment.
Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and
increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of government programs; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; the impact of an inflationary or deflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize our deferred income tax asset; our ability to utilize our tax losses, which could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code; and information technology failures and data security breaches. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
