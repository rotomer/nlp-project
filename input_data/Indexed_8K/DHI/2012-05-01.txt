Indemnification
(a) The Issuers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each of the foregoing (collectively, the ""), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, judgments or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Issuers may otherwise have.
Underwriter Indemnified Parties
(b) In case any action shall be brought against any Underwriter Indemnified Party, based upon the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Issuers, the Underwriters shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing and the Issuers shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and payment of all fees and expenses. Such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Issuers, (ii) the Issuers shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both such Underwriter Indemnified Party and the Issuers and such Underwriter Indemnified Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Issuers (in which case the Issuers shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such Underwriter Indemnified Party, it being understood, however, that the Issuers shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Underwriter Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative and that all such
 
fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred). The Issuers shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without the Company's written consent but if settled with the written consent of the Company, the Issuers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter Indemnified Parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriter Indemnified Parties, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Underwriter Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Underwriter Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Underwriter Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not contain any admission of guilt in respect of any Underwriter Indemnified Party.
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuers, their directors, their officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Issuers within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to the Underwriter Indemnified Parties but only with reference to information relating to an Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information. In case any action shall be brought against the Issuers, any of their directors, any such officer or any person controlling the Issuers based on the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Issuers (except that if the Issuers shall have assumed the defense thereof, such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter), and the Issuers, their directors, any such officers and any person controlling the Issuers shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by Section 7(b) hereof.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the compensation received by the Underwriters (based on discount to investors on resale), bear to the sum of such total net proceeds and such compensation. The relative fault of the Issuers and the Underwriters shall be determined by reference to,
 
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
The Underwriters confirm and the Issuers acknowledge that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Securities by the Underwriters set forth in the third and eighth (with caption "Short positions") paragraphs of the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus Supplement constitute the only information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Issuers by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Time of Sale Information for all purposes under this Agreement.

The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above. The Company will pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2012, until the principal is paid or made available for payment. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from May 1, 2012, that, if there is no existing default in the payment of interest, and if this Security is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding interest payment date, interest shall accrue from such interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
provided
 
The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest, if any, which will be paid on such special payment date to Holders of record on such special record date as may be fixed by the Company) to the persons who are registered Holders of Securities at the close of business on May 1 or November 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
 
Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change or appoint any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar without notice. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar.
 
The Company may redeem the Securities at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts: (i) 100% of their principal amount; and (ii) the present value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Securities being redeemed on the redemption date, discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis, at the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points (0.50%), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities to the redemption date. In determining the redemption price and accrued interest, interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Securities or portions of them called for redemption, that if the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price together with accrued interest, interest shall continue to accrue at the rate borne by the Securities.
provided
 
The Securities are in registered form only without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities by presentation of such Securities to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Security selected for redemption or purchase, except the unredeemed or unpurchased part thereof if the Security is redeemed or purchased in part, or transfer or exchange any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or purchased.
 
The registered Holder of this Security shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and thereafter, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Securities may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each Series affected by the amendment and any past default or compliance with any provision relating to any Series of the Securities may be waived in a particular instance with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such Series. Without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities in certain respects as specified in the Indenture.
 
When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Securities and the Indenture, the predecessor will be released from those obligations.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its affiliates, as if it were not Trustee, including owning or pledging the Securities.
 
A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.
 
The Indenture contains certain provisions pertaining to defeasance and discharge, which provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth herein.
 
This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
 
THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP and ISIN numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP and ISIN numbers in notices of repurchase as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of repurchase and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
 
The Company will furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture and the applicable Authorizing Resolution or supplemental indenture. Requests may be made to: D.R. Horton, Inc., 301 Commerce St., Suite 500, Fort Worth, Texas 76102, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.
 
In the event that there shall occur a Change of Control Triggering Event, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Company shall make an offer to each Holder of the Securities to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Securities at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Events of Default relating to the Securities are defined in Article Six of the Base Indenture as modified by the Supplemental Indenture. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the rights and obligations of the Company and the Holders shall be as set forth in the Indenture.

all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. To the extent that our opinions may be dependent upon such matters, we have assumed, without independent investigation, that each of the Guarantors, other than the Guarantors identified on Annex A as "Specified Guarantors" (each Guarantor so identified, a "Specified Guarantor") is validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all requisite corporate or other entity power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Note Documents to which it is a party; that the execution and delivery of such documents by each such party and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and do not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to each such party; and that such documents have been duly executed and delivered by each such party. As to any facts material to these opinions, we have relied to the extent we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors and others.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms and when the Notes with the Guarantees endorsed thereon have been duly authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantees of the Notes will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors obligated thereon, enforceable against such Guarantors in accordance with their respective terms.
The opinions expressed above are subject to the following additional exceptions, qualifications, limitations and assumptions:
A. We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and to the extent relevant for our opinions herein the laws of the States of California, Colorado and Texas and the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. We are not admitted to practice in the State of Delaware; however, we are generally familiar with the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act as currently in effect and have made such inquiries as we consider necessary to render these opinions. We have further assumed without independent investigation that the operating agreement of each Specified Guarantor that is a Delaware limited liability company constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms; to the extent our opinions are dependent on the interpretation of such agreement, they are based on the plain meaning of the provisions thereof in light of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. Without limitation, we do not express any opinion regarding any
