Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the future results expressed by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: a downturn in the homebuilding industry, including deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; constriction of the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing, increases in mortgage interest rates and the effects of government programs; the level of success of our strategies in responding to conditions in the industry; the impact of an inflationary or deflationary environment; changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions; the risks associated with our inventory ownership position in changing market conditions; supply risks for land, materials and labor; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; our ability to realize the full amount of our deferred income tax asset; our ability to
utilize the full amount of our tax losses, which could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code; and information technology failures and data security breaches.
