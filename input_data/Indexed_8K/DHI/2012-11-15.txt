Performance Determination of Fiscal 2010 Grant of Performance Restricted Stock Units
On September 30, 2010, the Compensation Committee made an award of long-term performance restricted stock units under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan to Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz. The performance period for the Performance RSUs was October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2012

The four performance goals were (i) relative total shareholder return (ii) relative return on investment (iii) relative selling, general and administrative expense containment and (iv) relative gross profit . Each Performance Goal is weighted twenty-five percent (25%) of the target number of Performance RSUs. The Performance RSUs had a target amount of 100,000 which could be increased or decreased based on performance rankings at the end of the Performance Period.

After completion of the Performance Period, the Compensation Committee evaluated the relative peer group rankings for the four performance goals and the terms of the Performance RSUs and determined that Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz each vested in 162,500 Performance RSUs. The Compensation Committee approved payout of the Performance RSUs to each of Mr. Horton and Mr. Tomnitz in the form of 162,500 shares of common stock.

Three-Year Performance Restricted Stock Units AwardVesting September 30, 2015.
On November 8, 2012, the Compensation Committee approved an award of performance restricted stock units pursuant to the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated to the following executive officers and in the following amounts:
("Performance RSUs")
("2006 Plan")
 
The Performance RSUs relate to a three-year performance period beginning on October 1, 2012 and ending on September 30, 2015. The Performance RSU will vest if four performance goals are satisfied. The four performance goals relate to relative total shareholder return relative return on investment relative selling, general and administrative expense containment and relative gross profit . Each Performance Goal is weighted twenty-five percent (25%) of the target number of Performance RSUs. The target number of Performance RSUs may be increased to a maximum number of 400,000 for Mr. Horton and 300,000 for Mr. Tomnitz upon maximum achievement of each of the four Performance Goals and decreased to a minimum number of zero upon minimum achievement of each of the four Performance Goals. Performance and percentages that fall between the maximum RSUs, the Target RSUs and the minimum (zero) RSUs shall be ranked using linear interpolation. The Company's peer group includes ten publicly traded homebuilding companies, and with the Company included, includes eleven homebuilding companies in the final rankings.
(the "2015 Performance Period")
("TSR"),
("ROI"),
("SG&A")
("GP") (collectively, the "Performance Goals")
Each Performance RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock if vesting is satisfied. The Compensation Committee reserves the sole discretion to pay the final earned and vested Performance RSUs in equity, cash or a combination of both. The Performance RSUs have no rights to dividends or voting.
 
Vesting of the TSR Performance Goal component will be determined after the 2015 Performance Period based on a comparison of the Company's TSR to the S&P 500 Index's TSR as computed by Standard and Poor's using their TSR methodology. Vesting of the ROI, SG&A and GP Performance Goal components will be determined after the 2015 Performance Period based on the relative ranking of the Company's performance on each Performance Goal to each peer group company's performance on each Performance Goal. Any portion of the Performance RSUs that do not vest due to inadequate relative performance will be forfeited. The Compensation Committee may use its sole discretion to adjust downward, in part or in whole the vested Performance RSUs or the value of the Performance RSUs based on performance of the Company, including based on total annual pre-tax income or stock price of the Company, the performance of the participant or other factors.
