Exhibit 99.1 DANAHER CORPORATION 2099 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, N.W. 12TH FLOOR WASHINGTON, D.C. 20016 TELEPHONE (202)-828-0850 FAX (202)-828-0860 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Patrick Allender Chief Financial Officer (202) 828-0850 DANAHER CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND 2002 RESULTS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WASHINGTON, D.C., January 30, 2003 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2002. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2002, excluding the effect of unusual items, were $124.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, a 27% increase over 2001. Excluding the effect of unusual items, net earnings for the 2001 fourth quarter were $92.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2002 including the impact of all unusual items were $161.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $33.1 million, or $0.23 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2001. As indicated in the reconciliation presented below, the unusual items affecting the fourth quarter of 2002 include benefits resulting from unused reserves associated with the restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001, a lower effective income tax rate and the reduction of income tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation. The unusual items affecting the fourth quarter 2001 net earnings included the costs associated with the restructuring program announced in the quarter as well as the effect of goodwill amortization which was required prior to the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 (SFAS 142) as of January 1, 2002. Sales for the 2002 fourth quarter were $1,275.0 million compared to $918.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, an increase of 39%. For the full year 2002, net earnings excluding the effect of unusual items were $426.1 million, or $2.74 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of unusual items, earnings for the full year 2001 were $396.1 million, or $2.66 per diluted share. Net earnings for 2002 including the effect of all unusual items were $290.4 million, or $1.88 per diluted share (which includes a charge of $1.10 per share related to a change in accounting), compared with $297.7 million, or $2.01 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2001. Consistent with the fourth quarter, the unusual items impacting the full year 2002 included benefits resulting from unused reserves associated with the restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001, the reduction of income tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation as well as gains on the sale of real estate. Net earnings for 2002 were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge totaling $173.8 million ($1.10 per diluted share) related to the adoption of SFAS 142. The unusual items affecting the full year 2001 net earnings included the negative effects of accruing the costs associated with the restructuring program announced in 2001 as well as the impact of goodwill amortization that ceased upon the Company's adoption of SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002. Sales for 2002 were $4.577 billion compared to $3.782 billion in 2001, an increase of 21%. H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year results. Total sales for the quarter grew 39%, due primarily to new acquisitions, but also due to a 3.5% core volume increase. Strong gains in our process/environmental controls segment, particularly in the electronic test and motion product lines, offset a slight decline in the tools and components segment. We have again achieved record cash flow with 2002 operating cash flow totaling $710.3 million, a 17% increase over the 2001 level of $608.5 million. Although signs of a near term economic recovery are mixed, we remain optimistic regarding our ability to outperform in 2003." Danaher Corporation is a leading manufacturer of Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components.(www.danaher.com) ---------------
