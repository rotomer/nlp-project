WASHINGTON, D.C., April 17, 2003  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings for its first quarter ended March 28, 2003 were $103.1 million, 25% higher than its 2002 first quarter net earnings, before the effect of a change in accounting principle, of $82.7 million. Diluted earnings per share for the 2003 first quarter were $0.65, an 18% increase over the comparable $0.55 for the 2002 first quarter. The net loss for the 2002 first quarter, after the effect of the accounting change, was $91.0 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. Sales for the 2003 first quarter were $1,196.2 million, 19% higher than the $1,004.2 million reported for the 2002 first quarter.
 
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to report record first quarter 2003 earnings. Record sales were driven by acquisition growth of 15% and core volume growth of 1%. Currency gains added approximately 3% to sales. Organic growth in our Process/Environmental Controls segment, in particular in our Motion business, offset the expected decline in the Tools and Components segment. Our operating cash flow of $214 million was more than twice net income. We are pleased with our performance through this period of uncertainty but we remain cautious regarding the economic challenges that persist. Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to deliver positive results for the balance of the year. "
