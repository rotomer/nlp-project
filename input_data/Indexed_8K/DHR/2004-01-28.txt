FOURTH QUARTER AND 2003 RESULTS
 
WASHINGTON, D.C., January 29, 2004  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003.  Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003, including the impact of a gain related to the curtailment of the Company's cash balance pension plan of $0.09 per share, were $169.9 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared with $161.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2002, including the effect of unusual items.  Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003, excluding the pension curtailment gain, were $155.4 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, a 23% increase over the comparable earnings per share amount for 2002.  Excluding the effect of unusual items, net earnings for the 2002 fourth quarter were $124.4 million, or $0.79 per diluted share.  As indicated in the reconciliation presented below, the unusual items affecting the fourth quarter of 2002 include benefits resulting from unused reserves associated with restructuring programs announced in the fourth quarter of 2001, a lower effective income tax rate and the reduction of income tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation.  Sales for the 2003 fourth quarter were $1,488.8 million compared to $1,275.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of 17%.
 
Net earnings for the full year 2003 including the effect of all unusual items were $536.8 million, or $3.37 per diluted share, compared with $290.4 million, or $1.88 per diluted share for 2002 (which includes a charge of $173.8 million or $1.10 per share related to a change in accounting principles).  For 2003, net earnings excluding the effect of unusual items were $521.7 million, or $3.28 per diluted share, a 20% increase over comparable earnings per share for 2002.  Excluding the effect of unusual items, earnings for the full year 2002 were $426.1 million, or $2.74 per diluted share.   The unusual items impacting the full year 2003 included the pension curtailment gain as well as gains on the sale of real estate.  The unusual items impacting the full year 2002 included the items described above with respect to the 2002 fourth quarter as well as a change in accounting principles and gains on the sale of real estate.  Sales for 2003 were $5,293.9 million compared to $4,577.2 million in 2002, an increase of 16%.
 
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year results.  Total sales for the quarter grew 17%, including a 6% increase in revenues from existing businesses, the largest such increase since the third quarter of 2000.  We experienced strong gains in both our process/environmental controls and our tools and components segments.  We have again achieved record cash flow with 2003 operating cash flow totaling $861.5 million, a 21% increase over the 2002 level of $710.3 million.  As signs of an economic recovery become more broad-based, we are again optimistic about our ability to outperform in 2004."

(A) 
 
This reconciliation is presented to quantify the financial impact of unusual items on net earnings and net earnings per share.  Since these unusual items have the impact of increasing reported net earnings (with the exception of the change in accounting principle), we believe it is important to quantify the impact these items have on reported results to enable the reader a better understanding of the earnings trends excluding these items.  These measures should be read in combination with the overall financial results presented in the Statement of Earnings for the periods presented.
