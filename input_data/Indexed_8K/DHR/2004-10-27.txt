ITEM 8.01              OTHER EVENTS
 
As reported in Danaher's Corporation's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended July 2, 2004 and October 1, 2004, respectively, in June 2004 a federal jury returned a liability finding against a subsidiary of the Company in a patent infringement action relating to sighting technology for infrared thermometers, finding that the subsidiary willfully infringed two patents and awarding the plaintiff approximately $8 million in damages.  On October 26, 2004, the judge entered an order trebling the awarded damages and requiring the subsidiary to pay plaintiff's legal fees.  The Company believes it has meritorious grounds to seek reversal of the order and intends to vigorously pursue all available means to achieve reversal.  The purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired the subsidiary in 2002 provides indemnification for the Company with respect to these matters and management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
