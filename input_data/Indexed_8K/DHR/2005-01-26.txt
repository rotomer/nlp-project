The prior year's net earnings included a gain related to the curtailment of the Company's cash balance pension plan of $0.05 per share. Excluding this gain, earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2004, increased 40% over the comparable period for 2003. Sales for the 2004 fourth quarter were $1,979.6 million compared to $1,488.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 33%.

Impact on Earnings and Earnings Per Share of Pension Curtailment
 
 
Impact on Operating Profit Excluding Gain on Pension Curtailment
 
 
The Company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing the ongoing contributions to its Cash Balance Pension Plan effective December 31, 2003. The Company has calculated the Earnings Per Share growth and increase in Operating Profit excluding the curtailment gain. Management believes this is a more accurate comparison of year over year earnings and operating profit improvement since inclusion of this gain abnormally impacts fourth quarter and full year results in 2003 and distorts the comparison with the current period results.
