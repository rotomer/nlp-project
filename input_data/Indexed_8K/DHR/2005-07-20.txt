DANAHER CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
WASHINGTON, D.C., July 21, 2005  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings for its second quarter ended July 1, 2005 including the effect of certain gains of $0.03 per share were $229 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, 25.5% higher than its 2004 second quarter net earnings of $182 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of these gains, net earnings per diluted share would have been $0.67, a 19.5% increase over the comparable earnings per share for 2004. Sales for the 2005 second quarter were $1,929 million, 19% higher than the $1,621 million reported for the 2004 second quarter. The $0.03 per share gains referred to above relate to the sale of a business and a minority interest.
 
Net earnings for the first six months of 2005 including the effect of the gains were $417 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared with $327 million, or $1.01 per diluted share for 2004, an increase of 27.5%. Excluding the effect of the above described gains, net earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2005 would have been $1.24, a 23% increase over the comparable earnings per share for 2004. Sales for the first six months of 2005 were $3,755 million compared to $3,164 million for the first six months of 2004, an increase of 19%.
 
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to again report record quarterly earnings. We are particularly pleased to report that growth from existing businesses, also known as core revenues, accounted for 5.5% growth, with all three of our reporting segments delivering higher core revenue growth as compared to the first quarter. Total sales growth for the quarter also includes acquisition growth of 12% and currency gains of 1.5%. Our operating cash flow for the first half of 2005 of $595 million was another record and a 19% increase over the first half of 2004. The broad-based strength we continue to see across our businesses reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver positive results for the second half of 2005."

The Company recorded gains and losses on unusual matters and real estate sales in the first two quarters of 2005 and 2004. The Company has presented its earnings per share growth excluding the unusual matters and real estate sale gains (losses). Management believes that presenting certain financial information without these unique items is more representative of the Company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors. This information should not be used as a substitute for net earnings or earnings per share in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
