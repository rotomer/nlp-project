ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS
 
As of September 26, 2005, the Danaher Board of Directors elected James A. Lico Executive Vice President of the Company. Mr. Lico, 39 years old, has worked for Danaher since 1996, serving most recently as President of Fluke Corporation from July 2000 until September 2005, as Vice President and Group Executive of Danaher Corporation from December 2002 until September 2005, and as Vice President  Danaher Business Systems Office from September 2004 until September 2005. Mr. Lico holds office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
 
In addition, as of September 26, 2005 Danaher entered into a Noncompetition Agreement with Mr. Lico, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Under the terms of the Noncompetition Agreement, Mr. Lico agrees, during the term of his employment with Danaher and for a period of one year following termination of his employment, not to compete with Danaher anywhere in the United States, not to sell to, offer to sell to or solicit certain customers of Danaher, and not to hire or solicit any employees of Danaher or otherwise encourage any employees of Danaher to leave Danaher. The Noncompetition Agreement also contains obligations of Mr. Lico relating to nondisclosure of confidential information, works-made-for-hire and assignment of intellectual property, and nondisparagement. In consideration of Mr. Lico's obligations under the agreement, Danaher agrees that if Danaher terminates Mr. Lico's employment without cause prior to the termination of the agreement, Danaher will pay him severance equal to nine months salary (at the rate in effect at the time of termination) and an additional three months salary if the officer executes a standard release at the time of termination, subject to certain clawback provisions in the event the officer breaches the agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the Noncompetition Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Noncompetition Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Dated: September 26, 2005
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
 
Danaher Corporation, an "at will" employer, believes that recruiting and retaining the very best people to work in its highly competitive businesses means treating them fairly, rewarding their contributions, and thereby establishing a strong partnership for our collective well-being and continued success. Employment at Danaher and its divisions typically provides associates with specialized and unique knowledge and confidential information, which, if used in competition with Danaher, would cause harm to Danaher. As such, it is reasonable to expect a commitment from our associates that protects Danaher's interests and therefore their own interests. You are encouraged to read and sign this Agreement in the spirit intended: our collective long-term growth and success.

13. . This Agreement shall not be amended except by a written instrument hereafter signed by the Company and the Associate. The failure of the Company to enforce, or delay in enforcing, any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any rights or deprive the Company of the right to insist thereafter upon strict adherence to that or any other term of this Agreement, nor shall a waiver of any breach of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach. No waiver of a right under any provision of this Agreement shall be binding on the Company unless made in writing and signed by the President of the Company. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of Danaher and the Associate relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof between the Associate on the one hand and Danaher and/or any current or former subsidiary of Danaher on the other hand, including without limitation any similar agreement entered into prior to the date hereof between the Associate on the one hand and Danaher and/or any current or former subsidiary of Danaher on the other hand.
