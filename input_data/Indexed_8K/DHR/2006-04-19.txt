Exhibit 99.1
DANAHER CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 20, 2006  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $216 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, 15% higher than its 2005 first quarter net earnings of $188 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. Included in the 2006 first quarter earnings per share was $0.025 per share related to the expensing of stock options as well as the benefit of $0.01 per share resulting from the reversal of approximately $3 million of tax reserves related to prior years. Additionally, earnings per share in the first quarter of 2005 were positively impacted by a $0.01 per share gain related to the sale of real estate. On a pro forma basis, absent these special items but including option expensing in both years, earnings per share for the first quarter of 2006 improved approximately 20%. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
Sales for the 2006 first quarter were $2.14 billion, 17.5% higher than the $1.83 billion reported for the 2005 first quarter.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very pleased to announce another record quarter. Growth from existing businesses, also known as core revenues, was 7.5%. Total sales growth for the quarter also included acquisition growth of 12.5% and a negative currency impact of 2.5%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2006 was a record $337 million, 8% higher than the record first quarter of 2005. The broad-based strength we continue to see across our businesses reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver positive results for the remainder of 2006"

Supplemental Reconciliation of Earnings Per Share
Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005
 
In addition to the results provided in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company has provided a non-GAAP measure (the "non-GAAP measure") which compares earnings per share for the first quarter of 2005 to earnings per share for the first quarter of 2006 on a basis which includes stock option expense in both periods and excludes special items relating to a lower effective tax rate in the 2006 period and a sale of real estate in the 2005 period. The non-GAAP measure should not be considered a replacement for earnings per share calculated according to GAAP. The attached table provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP.
The non-GAAP measure is a financial measure we use to evaluate the underlying results and operating performance of our business. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that impacted the company's earnings in the relevant periods, and includes an item that was not included in the Company's earnings in the first quarter of 2005. We believe however that the non-GAAP measure helps investors to draw comparisons between operating results reported in different periods and identify underlying trends that might otherwise be masked by earnings per share calculated according to GAAP.
