Exhibit 99.1
DANAHER ANNOUNCES RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., July 20, 2006  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings for its second quarter ended June 30, 2006 were $315 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, 40% higher than its 2005 second quarter net earnings of $229 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. Included in the 2006 second quarter results were the effect of a gain of $0.03 per share related to the sale of an interest in shares of First Technology PLC and the impact from certain tax reserve reductions of approximately $0.15 per share. On a pro forma basis, excluding the effect of these items but including option expensing in both years, earnings per diluted share would have been $0.80, a 23% increase over the comparable earnings per share for 2005 which also excludes approximately $0.03 per share of gains. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP, see the attached table.
Sales for the 2006 second quarter were $2,350 million, 21.5% higher than the $1,929 million reported for the 2005 second quarter.
Net earnings for the first six months of 2006 including the effect of the gains were $530 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, compared with $417 million, or $1.28 per diluted share for 2005, an increase of 27%. Excluding the effect of the above described items, net earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2006 would have been $1.46, a 21.5% increase over the comparable earnings per share for 2005. Sales for the first six months of 2006 were $4,493 million compared to $3,755 million for the first six months of 2005, an increase of 19.5%.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased to again report record quarterly earnings. Revenue growth from existing businesses, also known as core revenues, remained strong and accounted for just over 6% growth, with all three of our reporting segments contributing higher core revenue growth as compared to the same period in 2005. Total sales growth for the quarter also includes acquisition growth of 15.5% and a negligible impact from currency. Our operating cash flow for the first half of 2006 was $652 million, another record. The strength we continue to see across our businesses continues to reinforce our confidence in our ability to deliver positive results for the second half of 2006."
Danaher Corporation is a leading manufacturer of Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies, and Tools and Components. (www.danaher.com)

NOTE: In addition to the results provided in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company has provided non-GAAP measures (the "non-GAAP measures") which compare earnings per share for the three and six months ended July 1, 2005 to earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 on a basis which includes stock option expense in both periods and excludes special items relating to a reduction of income tax reserves, gains related to the sale of a minority interest and gains related to the sale of real estate and other assets in the second quarter of 2006, and the sale of real estate and other assets and gains from the sale of a minority interest and related interest benefit in the 2005 period. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered a replacement for earnings per share calculated according to GAAP. The above table provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to earnings per share calculated according to GAAP. The non-GAAP measure is a financial measure we use to evaluate the underlying results and operating performance of our business. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that impacted the company's earnings in the relevant periods, and includes an item that was not included in the Company's earnings in the first half of 2005. We believe however that the non-GAAP measure helps investors to draw comparisons between operating results reported in different periods and identify underlying trends that might otherwise be masked by earnings per share calculated according to GAAP.
