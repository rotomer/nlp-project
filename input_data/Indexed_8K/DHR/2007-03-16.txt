The Board of Directors of Danaher Corporation approved amended and restated by-laws of Danaher Corporation, effective as of March 13, 2007. The amendments are intended to update certain provisions of the Company's by-laws, summarized as follows.
The voting standard required for approval of matters (other than the election of directors) by the Company's stockholders, set forth in Article II, Section 6 of the By-laws, has been modified to conform to the language set forth in Section 216 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Previously, the By-laws provided that "Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any question, other than the election of directors, brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock represented and entitled to vote thereat." The Board amended the language in order to ensure that the voting standard for the Company is consistent with the default voting standard under Delaware law. The amended By-laws provide that "Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, on any matter other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders."
The Board also amended Article V, Section 1 and Section 4 of the By-laws to expressly provide for the issuance of uncertificated shares. Under amendments to the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, which will be effective on January 1, 2008, issuers are required to be eligible for a direct registration program, which permits an investor's ownership to be recorded and maintained on the books of the issuer or its transfer agent without the issuance of a physical stock certificate.
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated by-laws, a copy of which is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Section 1.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
nolo contendere

Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. Any person seeking indemnification from the Corporation under this Article VIII must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such person for which indemnity will or could be sought.

Authorization of Indemnification

The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer.

Section 4.
Good Faith Defined

Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application.

Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII (which undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the person to make such repayment); provided, however, that, with respect to persons who are not directors, no advancement of expenses shall be made under this Article VIII if the Corporation shall determine that (i) such person did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A director or officer seeking advancement of expenses shall submit to the Corporation a written request.
Section 6.
Expenses Payable in Advance
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Section 7.
Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
