$1.9 Billion Bridge Loan Facility
On November 13, 2007, Danaher Corporation ("Danaher") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a $1.9 billion revolving bridge loan facility (the "Credit Agreement") with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Book Manager, and a syndicate of lenders from time to time party thereto, including UBS Loan Finance LLC. The Credit Agreement expires on the earlier of (1) November 11, 2008 and (2) in the event that a majority of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. common stock (together with any Tektronix, Inc. common stock already owned by Danaher or its subsidiaries) on a fully diluted basis (but excluding any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Tektronix's outstanding notes) have not been validly tendered, and not withdrawn, pursuant to the cash tender offer dated October 18, 2007 (the "Tender Offer") by a subsidiary of Danaher to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc., or other conditions precedent to the closing of the Credit Agreement have not been satisfied, in each case by February 28, 2008, February 28, 2008. The description of the Credit Agreement set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is referenced as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
Borrowings under the revolving bridge loan facility bear interest as follows: (1) Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) bear interest at a variable rate equal to London inter-bank offered rate plus a margin of between 13.5 and 32 basis points, depending on Danaher's credit rating from time to time, plus a specified, per annum mandatory cost intended to compensate the lenders for the cost of complying with certain regulatory requirements; and (2) Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) bear interest at a variable rate equal to the higher of (a) the Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from time to time) plus 1/2 of 1%, and (b) the Prime Lending Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal from time to time. In addition, Danaher is required to pay a per annum facility fee of between 4 and 8 basis points (depending on Danaher's credit rating from time to time) based on the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement, and in certain circumstances a utilization fee of between 5 and 10 basis points (depending on Danaher's credit rating from time to time) based on the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In the event that the credit ratings assigned to Danaher by nationally recognized debt rating agencies are downgraded as set forth in the Credit Agreement, the interest rate, facility fees and utilization fees under the revolving bridge loan facility are subject to incremental upward adjustments. The Credit Agreement requires Danaher to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. The revolving bridge loan facility is required to be prepaid with the net cash proceeds of certain equity or debt issuances by Danaher or any of its subsidiaries. The revolving bridge loan facility is prepayable at Danaher's option in whole or in part without premium or penalty, subject to the prepayment of an additional fee, under certain circumstances.
Danaher's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. Danaher has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the obligations of each of its subsidiaries in the event a subsidiary is named a borrower under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Danaher and certain of its subsidiaries to: enter into agreements restricting such subsidiaries from making payments to or guaranteeing the obligations of Danaher; incur liens; sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; enter into mergers or consolidations; enter into transactions with affiliates; and use proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement for other than permitted uses. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. Certain changes of control would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Danaher intends to use the Credit Agreement as credit support for Danaher's Global Commercial Paper Program and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
Certain of the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for Danaher and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
Increase of U.S. Commercial Paper Program
On November 14, 2007, concurrently with entering into the Credit Agreement described above, Danaher increased the size of its U.S. Commercial Paper Program (which program was previously described in Danaher's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on May 11, 2006). After giving effect to such increase, the principal amount of outstanding unsecured commercial paper notes under Danaher's Global Commercial Paper Program may not exceed $3,400,000,000.
Danaher anticipates using a portion of the proceeds from issuances under the Global Commercial Paper Program, together with a combination of available cash and other borrowings, for the proposed acquisition by Danaher of Tektronix, Inc. pursuant to the Tender Offer.
 
The information described above under "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement$1.9 Billion Bridge Loan Facility" is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03. In addition, the information described above under "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementIncrease of U.S. Commercial Paper Program," to the extent such obligations constitute a payment obligation under a borrowing arrangement that is scheduled to mature in one year or more, also is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.10. Evidence of Debt
. (a) (i) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. (ii) All payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. (iii) The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. (iv) All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
2.11. Payments Generally
(b) If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
 
(c) Unless any Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
(i) if any Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to a Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the applicable Borrower, and such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or any Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
Compensation Period
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation.
(f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through
2.12. Sharing of Payments
 
the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; , , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, without interest thereon. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to ) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.

Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

. If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (iii) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

3.04. Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy.
(a) If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding, maintaining or participating in Eurodollar Rate Loans, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office and (iii) reserve requirements included in determining the Eurodollar Rate, does not represent the cost to such Lender, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
Section 3.01
(b) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for such reduction.
. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower; or
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to ;

Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
