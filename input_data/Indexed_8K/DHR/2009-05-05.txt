No portion of an Option that is unexercisable at an Optionee's termination of employment (for any reason other than Retirement) will thereafter become exercisable, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, either initially or by amendment. In the event the Participant reaches age sixty-five (65) while employed, irrespective of whether the Participant then retires, all time-based vesting conditions on outstanding Options will be deemed satisfied in full and the Options shall become fully vested once it has been determined that any performance-based vesting conditions or Performance Objectives have been satisfied.
 
 
 
 
Payment in full of the Exercise Price need not accompany the written notice of exercise provided the notice directs that the shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise be delivered, either in certificate form or in book entry form, to a licensed broker acceptable to the Company as the agent for the individual exercising the Option and at the time the shares are delivered to the broker, either in certificate form or in book entry form, the broker will tender to the Company cash or cash equivalents acceptable to the Company and equal to the Exercise Price.
The Administrator may agree to payment through the tender to the Company of shares of Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock offered as payment will be valued, for purposes of determining the extent to which the Optionee has paid the Exercise Price, at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. The Administrator may also, in its discretion, accept attestation of ownership of Common Stock and issue a net number of shares upon Option exercise.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee shall determine whether such Performance Objectives are attained, and such determination will be final and conclusive. Each Performance Objective may be expressed in absolute and/or relative terms, may be based on or use comparisons with internal targets, the past performance of the Company (including the performance of one or more Subsidiaries, divisions, business platforms, and/or operating units) and/or the past or current performance of other companies. In the case of earnings-based measures, Performance Objectives may use comparisons relating to capital (including, but not limited to, the cost of capital), shareholders' equity and/or shares outstanding, or to assets or net assets.
For Awards intended to comply with Code Section 162(m), the measures used in setting Performance Objectives under the Plan for any given Performance Period will, to the extent applicable, be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and in a manner consistent with the methods used in the Company's audited financial statements, without regard to (1) extraordinary or nonrecurring items in accordance with GAAP, (2) the impact of any change in accounting principles that occurs during the Performance Period (or that occurred during any period that the Performance Period is being compared to) and the cumulative effect thereof (provided that the Committee may either apply the changed accounting principle to all periods referenced in the Award, or exclude the changed accounting principle from all periods referenced in the Award), (3) goodwill and other intangible impairment charges, (4) gains or charges associated with discontinued operations or restructuring activities, (5) gains or charges related to the sale or impairment of assets, (6) all charges directly related to acquisitions, including all contingent liabilities identified as of the acquisition date, (7) the impact of any change in tax law that occurs during the Performance Period (or that occurred during any period that the Performance Period is being compared to) which exceeds $10 million, and (8) other objective income, expense, asset, and/or cash flow adjustments as may be consistent with the purposes of the Performance Objectives set for the given Performance Period and specified by the Committee within the Applicable Period, unless in each case the Committee decides otherwise within the Applicable Period; provided, that with respect to the gains and charges referred to in sections (3) through (6), only gains or charges that individually or as part of a series of related items exceed $10 million are excluded. In addition to the Performance Objectives established for any Award that is intended to comply with Code Section 162(m) and any time-based vesting provisions that may apply to such Award, any Award that is intended to comply with Code Section 162(m) shall not vest under its terms unless the Company has first achieved four consecutive fiscal quarters of positive net income during the period between the grant date and the tenth anniversary of the grant date and the Administrator has certified that such performance has been satisfied.
 
 
In the event of a declaration of an extraordinary dividend on the Common Stock payable in a form other than Common Stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall make such adjustments as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate to the items set forth in subsections (a)  (c) in the preceding paragraph.
Any issue by the Company of any class of preferred stock, or securities convertible into shares of common or preferred stock of any class, will not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof will be made with respect to, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to any Award or the Exercise Price except as this Section 15 specifically provides. The grant of an Award under the Plan will not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or to consolidate, or to dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although in establishing such sub-plans, terms or procedures, the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify an Award for favorable foreign tax treatment or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment, the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on holders of Awards under the Plan.
 
The Plan is intended to conform to the extent necessary with all provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and all regulations and rules the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issues under those laws. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Administrator must administer the Plan, and Awards may be granted, vested and exercised, only in a way that conforms to such laws, rules, and regulations.
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, the Common Stock, when issued under an Award, will be subject to any other transfer restrictions, rights of first refusal, and rights of repurchase set forth in or incorporated by reference into other applicable documents, including the Company's articles or certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or generally applicable stockholders' agreements.
The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, take whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to comply with such restrictions and applicable laws, including placing legends on certificates and issuing stop-transfer orders to transfer agents and registrars.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Code Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the Company and its affiliates) as of his separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Plan or an Award constitutes deferred compensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Code Section 409A), and to the extent required by Code Section 409A, no payments due under this Plan or an Award may be made until the earlier of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following the participant's separation from service, or (ii) the participant's date of death; provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum, without interest, on the first day of the seventh month following the participant's separation from service. If this Plan or any Award fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall have any liability for any tax, penalty or interest imposed on the participant by Code Section 409A, and the participant shall have no recourse against the Company or any of its affiliates for payment of any such tax, penalty or interest imposed by Code Section 409A.
