On December 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of Danaher Corporation ("Danaher") appointed Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. to fill a current vacancy on Danaher's Board of Directors with an initial term that will expire at Danaher's 2011 annual meeting of shareholders.
As a non-employee director, Dr. Zerhouni will receive the same compensation paid to other non-employee directors of Danaher as disclosed in Danaher's annual proxy statement filed with the Commission on March 20, 2009.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
