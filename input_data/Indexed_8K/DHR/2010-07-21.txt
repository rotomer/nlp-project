WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 2010  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that GAAP net earnings for the quarter ended July 2, 2010 were $372.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, a 25% increase as compared to GAAP net earnings per diluted share of $0.44 for the second quarter 2009. On a non-GAAP basis, which reflects the adjustments identified in the attached reconciliation schedule, 2010 second quarter adjusted net earnings were $378.8 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, a 40% increase over 2009 second quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Sales for the 2010 second quarter were $3.3 billion, 24% higher than the $2.7 billion reported for the 2009 second quarter. Core revenues increased 14% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.
GAAP net earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $672.7 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net earnings of $533.4 million, or $.80 per diluted share for the first six months of 2009. Sales for the first six months of 2010 were $6.4 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the first six months of 2009, an increase of 20.5%.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our commitment over the last several years to organic growth investments, including new product development and go-to-market initiatives, combined with an improving macro environment allowed us to deliver outstanding core growth in the quarter. The quality of the growth is evident in both our year-over-year earnings performance and core margin expansion. Our performance year-to-date combined with the continued strength we see across our businesses reinforces our confidence in our ability to deliver positive results for the remainder of 2010."

DANAHER CORPORATION
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
($ in 000's except per share data)
 
Core Revenue Growth / Decline
 
Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share
We disclose the non-GAAP measures of adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share, which refer to GAAP net earnings and GAAP diluted net earnings per share, respectively, excluding the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate easier comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from these measures because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency, for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period.
The Company estimates the tax effect of the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the Company's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.
Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth/Decline
We use the term "core revenue" or "sales from existing businesses" to refer to GAAP revenue excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition ("acquisition sales"), and (2) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in GAAP revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue growth/decline" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
