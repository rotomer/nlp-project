During the fourth quarter of 2010, Danaher Corporation (the "Company") changed the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in its internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Company's businesses and the contribution of the Company's Tools and Components business to the Apex Tool Group, LLC joint venture. Beginning with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2010, the Company will report results in five separate business segments comprised of the Test & Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences & Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies segments. In addition, the historical results of the Tool related business and the Company's equity in earnings of the Apex joint venture will be shown separately in the Company's segment disclosures. The Company previously reported its operations under four segments: Professional Instrumentation; Medical Technologies; Industrial Technologies; and Tools & Components.
This Form 8-K provides information on this change in segment reporting and a summary of the Company's results had the new reporting structure been in place in 2008, 2009 and the first nine-months of 2010. The change in segment reporting will be reflected retrospectively, but in no way revises or restates the previously filed Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company for any period as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Exhibit 99.1 provides detailed segment sales and operating profit data for the year ended December 31, 2008, the four quarters and full year ended December 31, 2009 and the three completed quarters and year-to-date 2010.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
