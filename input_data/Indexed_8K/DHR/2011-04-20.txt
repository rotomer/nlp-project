DANAHER REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 21, 2011  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended April 1, 2011 were $420.2 million, or $0.61 per share on a diluted basis, a 42% increase as compared to diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the first quarter 2010, and a 33% increase as compared to adjusted diluted net earnings from continuing operations per share for the first quarter 2010. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the quarter ended April 1, 2011 were $9.1 million, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis.
As announced on January 18, 2011, Danaher has reached an agreement for the sale of its Pacific Scientific Aerospace business. The results from this business are reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements included in Danaher's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2011.
Sales from continuing operations for the 2011 first quarter were $3.3 billion, 11.0% higher than the $3.0 billion reported sales from continuing operations for the 2010 first quarter. Core revenues increased 10% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We were particularly pleased by our team's execution which led to strong core revenue and earnings growth during the quarter.

DANAHER CORPORATION
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
($ in 000's except per share data)
 
Core Revenue Growth
 
Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations
We disclose the non-GAAP measures of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, which refer to GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, respectively, excluding the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate easier comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from these measures because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency, for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred during a quarter in excess of $13.5 million (approximately $0.02 per share) are deemed significant.
The Company estimates the tax effect of the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the Company's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.
Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth
We use the term "core revenue" or "sales from existing businesses" to refer to GAAP revenue excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition ("acquisition sales"), (2) first quarter 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in GAAP revenue (excluding acquisition sales and first quarter 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales and first quarter 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue growth" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We exclude the effect of the first quarter 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because as a result of application of the equity method of accounting beginning with the formation of the joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in the first quarter of 2011.
