On June 23, 2011, Danaher Corporation ("Danaher") issued $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Floating Rate Notes"), $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.300% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.300% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes," and together with the 2014 Notes and the 2016 Notes, the "Fixed Rate Notes"; the Fixed Rate Notes together with the Floating Rate Notes are referred to herein as the "Notes"), in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159060) and a related prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Notes were sold pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") dated as of June 20, 2011 between Danaher and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement was separately filed with the SEC on June 21, 2011 as Exhibit 1.1 to Danaher's Current Report on Form 8-K.
The Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of December 11, 2007 (the "Indenture") between Danaher and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.) as trustee (the "Trustee") and a supplemental indenture relating to each series of Notes, each dated as of June 23, 2011 (together, the "Supplemental Indentures").
The Floating Rate Notes will mature on June 21, 2013. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.25% per year. Danaher will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year. The first such payment on the Floating Rate Notes will be made on September 21, 2011. The 2014 Notes will mature on June 23, 2014, the 2016 Notes will mature on June 23, 2016 and the 2021 Notes will mature on June 23, 2021. Interest on the 2014 Notes will accrue at the rate of 1.300% per year, interest on the 2016 Notes will accrue at the rate of 2.300% per year and interest on the 2021 Notes will accrue at the rate of 3.900% per year. Danaher will pay interest on the Fixed Rate Notes on June 23 and December 23 of each year. The first such payment on each series of Fixed Rate Notes will be made on December 23, 2011.
Danaher may redeem some or all of the 2014 Notes or the 2016 Notes at any time by paying a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), Danaher may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes by paying a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), Danaher may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
If Danaher does not consummate the previously-announced Beckman Coulter acquisition on or prior to December 31, 2011, or the merger agreement with Beckman Coulter is terminated prior to that date, Danaher will be required to redeem in whole and not in part the Notes on the special mandatory redemption date at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Notes, each holder of Notes may require Danaher to repurchase some or all of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
The Notes of each series are general unsecured obligations of Danaher, equal in right of payment with all existing and any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Danaher, senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of Danaher that is subordinated to the Notes, and effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future secured indebtedness of Danaher to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and any future indebtedness and any other liabilities of Danaher's subsidiaries.
Upon the occurrence of an event of default with respect to the Notes, which includes payment defaults, defaults in the performance of certain covenants, and bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, Danaher's obligations under the Notes may be accelerated, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would be immediately due and payable.
Danaher and its affiliates maintain various commercial and service relationships with the Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Affiliates of the Trustee may in the future engage in lending or hedging transactions with Danaher and its affiliates. In addition, certain of the underwriters party to the Purchase Agreement and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for Danaher, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the underwriters or their respective affiliates have been or are lenders under one or more of Danaher's credit facilities.
The above description of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures. The Indenture has been included as Exhibit 1.2 to Danaher's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 11, 2007, and the Supplemental Indentures are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 hereto.

Interest Payment Date
The amount of interest payable for any full or partial Interest Period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such Interest Period divided by 360. In the event that any scheduled Interest Payment Date (other than the Maturity Date) for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day which is a Business Day except that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
In the event that the Maturity Date or a Special Mandatory Redemption Date for any Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the related payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and no additional interest will accumulate on the amount payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date or Special Mandatory Redemption Date, as applicable). Interest due on the Maturity Date or a Special Mandatory Redemption Date (in each case, whether or not an Interest Payment Date) of any Notes will be paid to the Person to whom principal of such Notes is payable.
 
The interest rate on the Notes shall be reset quarterly on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year, commencing September 21, 2011 (each, an ""). The interest rate on the Notes for the period from and including the original issue date hereof to, but excluding, the initial Interest Reset Date (the "") will be three-month LIBOR (as computed below), determined as of the Interest Determination Date prior to such original issue date, plus 0.25% per year. Thereafter, the Notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR (as computed below) for the period from and including an Interest Reset Date to, but excluding, the immediately succeeding Interest Reset Date (each an "Interest Reset Period"), plus 0.25% per year. The final Interest Reset Period for the Notes will be the period from and including the Interest Reset Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date of the Notes to, but excluding, such Maturity Date.
Interest Reset Date
Initial Interest Period
If any Interest Reset Date for the Notes would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
Three-month LIBOR will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the applicable Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits in the LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity, commencing on the original issue date of the Notes or the related Interest Reset Date, as applicable, immediately following such Interest Determination Date, which appears on Reuters page LIBOR01 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the designated LIBOR Currency) ("") as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date; and
(i)
Reuters Page LIBOR01
If LIBOR cannot be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (i) above, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in the designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity, commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean calculated by the Calculation Agent of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., in New York City, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the designated LIBOR Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR determined as of such Interest Determination Date shall be LIBOR in effect on such Interest Determination Date.
(ii)
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for the Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and the Trustee (if the Calculation Agent is not the Trustee) of the interest rate for the new Interest Reset Period. Upon request of a holder of the Notes, the Calculation Agent will provide to such holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next Interest Reset Period.
All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Notes shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Company, absent manifest error.
In the event that the Maturity Date or a Special Mandatory Redemption Date for any Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then the related payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and no additional interest will accumulate on the amount payable for the period from and after the Maturity Date or Special Mandatory Redemption Date, as applicable). Interest due on the Maturity Date or a Special Mandatory Redemption Date (in each case, whether or not an Interest Payment Date) of any Notes will be paid to the Person to whom principal of such Notes is payable.
Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in Chicago, Illinois, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or by wire transfer to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Security Register.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
