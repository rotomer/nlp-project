Special Meetings
(a) Except as otherwise prescribed by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, Special Meetings of Stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, shall be called only by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary pursuant to a written request delivered to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary by (i) the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, (ii) the President, (iii) the Board of Directors or (iv) stockholders owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote who shall have delivered written requests to call such meeting in accordance with this By-Law. Except as otherwise required by law, Special Meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may not be called by any other person or persons. Any request by a stockholder or stockholders to call a Special Meeting shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and all other information required pursuant to Section 10 of this Article II. A Special Meeting request by a stockholder or
stockholders shall not be valid if (1) the Special Meeting request is received by the Corporation (A) during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting and ending on the date of the next Annual Meeting, or (B) during the period commencing on the date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting and ending 30 days after such meeting; (2) such Special Meeting request was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act") or other applicable law; (3) the request does not contain the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and all other information required pursuant to Section 10 of this Article II; or (4) the request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law. Stockholders may revoke a Special Meeting request by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at any time prior to the Special Meeting; provided, however, that if any such revocations are received by the Secretary and, as a result of such revocation, the number of un-revoked Special Meeting requests no longer represents at least the requisite number of shares entitling the stockholders to request the calling of a Special Meeting, then the Board shall have the discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the Special Meeting.
Following receipt of a valid request by any stockholder or stockholders entitled to call a Special Meeting pursuant to this Section 3, the Board of Directors shall determine a date and time for the requested meeting, which date shall not be less than 50 days nor more than 70 days after receipt and determination of the validity of such request, and the Board of Directors shall establish a record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such Special Meeting. Following such determination and establishment, it shall be the duty of the Secretary, or if the Secretary is unable or unwilling, an Assistant Secretary, to cause notice of the Special Meeting to be given in accordance with Section 4 of this Article II. The notice of such Special Meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. The Board of Directors may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at any Special Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of Directors or at the request of one or more stockholders.

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

A quorum, once established at a meeting, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum.
(b) Whether or not a quorum is present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person, present by means of remote communication in a manner, if any, authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall also have the power to adjourn the meeting to another place, if any, date and time. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.
. On any matter other than the election of directors, when a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the action is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-Laws, a different vote is required, or unless under the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, a different vote is provided, in which case such provision, rule or regulation will establish the vote required to effect such action. When a quorum is present, a properly nominated and qualified candidate for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with abstentions, broker non-votes and withheld votes not counted as a vote for or against such nominee's election); provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast for properly nominated and qualified candidates at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article II, Section 10 of these By-laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or before the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. Each stockholder may vote in person (including by means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting) or may authorize another person or persons to vote for such stockholder by a proxy executed or transmitted in a manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware by the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized agent and delivered (including by electronic transmission) to the Secretary of the Corporation. No proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. The

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either (a) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation, or (b) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with notice of the meeting. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present.

(b) A stockholder must provide written notice of a nomination or business to be brought at an Annual Meeting to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's Annual Meeting; provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 10(b), in the event that the date of the current year's Annual Meeting has changed by more than 30 days from the one-year anniversary of the date that the prior year's Annual Meeting was first convened, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, such stockholder's notice to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of (A) the 90th day prior to the current year's Annual Meeting and (B) the 10th day following the day on which notice of the date of the current year's Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the current year's Annual Meeting was made, whichever mailing or disclosure first occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10(b) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an Annual Meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominees would otherwise be due under this Section 10, a stockholder's notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public disclosure of such increase is first made by the Corporation.

In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an Annual or Special Meeting (or the public disclosure thereof) commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice.
(c) For nominations to be properly brought before a meeting, the stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (1) the information required under Section 10(e), and (2) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, (A) such person's name, age and address, (B) such person's principal occupation or employment, (C) the class, series and number of shares of stock of the Corporation

Except to the extent inconsistent with any rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
 
proper conduct of the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

action without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
