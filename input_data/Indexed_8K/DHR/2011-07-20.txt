Exhibit 99.1
DANAHER REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., July 21, 2011  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) announced today that net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter ended July 1, 2011 were $449.6 million, or $0.65 per share on a diluted basis, a 23% increase as compared to diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter 2010. On a non-GAAP basis, which reflects the adjustments identified in the attached reconciliation schedule, second quarter 2011 adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, were $0.69, a 28% increase over 2010 second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations.
Sales from continuing operations for the 2011 second quarter were $3.7 billion, 15.5% higher than the $3.2 billion reported sales from continuing operations for the 2010 second quarter. Core revenues increased 7.5% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We've been very pleased by our strong start to 2011 and our team's execution led to yet another quarter of solid core revenue and earnings growth. Our investments in new product development and go-to-market initiatives continued to drive organic growth and margin expansion and with our increasing exposure to higher growth emerging markets and the addition of Beckman Coulter to the portfolio, we believe we are well positioned to continue to outperform for the remainder of 2011 and beyond."

DANAHER CORPORATION
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
($ in 000's except per share data)
 
Core Revenue Growth
 
Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations
We disclose the non-GAAP measures of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, which refer to GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, respectively, excluding the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above. We also present these measures on a basis which excludes Beckman Coulter. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate easier comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from these measures because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We excluded the results attributable to Beckman Coulter to identify the impact of that acquisition on our business during the brief period during the quarter that we owned the business. The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs that Danaher typically incurs in a given period.
The Company estimates the tax effect of the items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the Company's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.
Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth
We use the term "core revenue" or "sales from existing businesses" to refer to GAAP revenue excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition ("acquisition sales"), (2) first half 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in GAAP revenue (excluding acquisition sales and first half 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales and first half 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue growth" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Danaher's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. We exclude the effect of the first half 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because as a result of application of the equity method of accounting beginning with the formation of the joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in the first half of 2011.
