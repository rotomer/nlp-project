As previously reported, on June 17, 2011, Danaher Corporation ("Danaher" or the "Company") entered into a $3.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the "364-Day Facility") with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Administrative Agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and UBS Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and a syndicate of lenders from time to time party thereto, in connection with Danaher's acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. The Company reduced the commitments under the 364-Day Facility from $3.0 billion to $2.2 billion effective as of June 27, 2011, from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion effective as of July 21, 2011 and from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion effective as of October 1, 2011. On December 21, 2011, the Company delivered a notice to the administrative agent for the 364-Day Facility reducing the commitments under the facility to zero and terminating the facility effective as of December 29, 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Facility at the time of its termination, and the termination of the facility does not trigger any early termination penalties.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
