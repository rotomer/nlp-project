DANAHER REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 19, 2012  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) today announced results for the first quarter of 2012. All financial metrics in this release reflect only the Company's continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 30, 2012 were $520.1 million, or $0.73 per share on a diluted basis, a 19.7% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 for the first quarter 2011. Sales for the 2012 first quarter were $4.3 billion, 31% higher than the $3.3 billion reported for the 2011 first quarter. Core revenues increased 1.5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011.
The Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 will be in the range of $0.76 to $0.81. The Company narrowed its full year 2012 diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.25 to $3.35 from a previous range of $3.20 to $3.35. The second quarter and full year 2012 EPS guidance includes $0.01 and $0.03 of anticipated dilution, respectively, related to the pending acquisition of X-Rite, Incorporated.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The quarter progressed largely as we expected and we were particularly pleased with our team's execution which led to excellent core operating margin expansion, cash flow and earnings performance. In addition, we were encouraged by the sequential business improvement within the quarter and anticipate core growth will accelerate in the second quarter. With improving core growth, the cost reductions undertaken in 2011 and an attractive acquisition environment, we believe we are well positioned for the balance of 2012 and beyond."

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
($ in 000's except per share data)
Core Revenue Growth
 
Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth
We use the term "core revenue" or "sales from existing businesses" to refer to GAAP revenue excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition ("acquisition sales") and (2) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in GAAP revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue growth" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
