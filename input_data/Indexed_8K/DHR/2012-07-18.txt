DANAHER REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
WASHINGTON, D.C., July 19, 2012  Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) today announced results for the second quarter of 2012. All financial metrics in this release reflect only the Company's continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
Net earnings for the quarter ended June 29, 2012 were $600.1 million, or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis, a 31% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $0.64 for the second quarter of 2011. Included in the current quarter results is a $0.03 benefit from a lower than anticipated income tax rate as well as a gain from resolving a contingency related to a prior asset disposal.
Revenues for the quarter were $4.6 billion, 25% higher than the $3.6 billion reported for the second quarter of 2011. Core revenues increased 3.5% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011.
The Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2012 will be in the range of $0.74 to $0.79. The Company updated its full year 2012 diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.19 to $3.26 from a previous range of $3.25 to $3.35, reflecting the anticipated negative currency impact from the recent strengthening of the US dollar, as well as the Company's plan to accelerate its restructuring activities, which is now anticipated to result in a full year cost of approximately $100 million. The mid-point of the Company's revised full year 2012 earnings per share guidance would result in approximately 14% year-on-year growth compared with the Company's adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 for 2011.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We were pleased by the sequential improvement in core growth and our very strong margin and cash flow performance in the quarter. While the team continues to execute well, the worsening macroeconomic headlines suggest it's prudent to accelerate cost actions while maintaining our growth investments. We believe our focus on capturing market share while accelerating cost reductions, coupled with our optimism on the acquisition front, positions us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond."

DANAHER CORPORATION
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE
Core Revenue Growth
 
Core Revenue and Core Revenue Growth
We use the term "core revenue" or "sales from existing businesses" to refer to GAAP revenue from existing operations excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition ("acquisition sales"), and (2) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue from existing operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term "core revenue growth" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
