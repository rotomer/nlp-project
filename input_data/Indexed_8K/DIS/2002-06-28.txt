ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) effective October 1, 2001, the beginning of its current fiscal year. On June 17, 2002, the Company filed supplemental information on Form 8-K regarding the pro forma impact of eliminating goodwill and intangible asset amortization for the prior fiscal years ended September 30, 1999, 2000 and 2001. The adjusted earnings and earnings per share figures in this supplemental information should have excluded all goodwill and intangible asset amortization but, inadvertently, the respective amounts for fiscal 2001 and 2000 did not eliminate all of the goodwill and intangible asset charges associated with the Internet Group. As a result, the supplemental earnings and earnings per share figures for fiscal 2001 and 2000 are better than originally filed, as follows ($ in millions except per share amounts). The amended prior-year pro forma disclosure filed herewith as Exhibit 99 includes the corrected amounts that reflect the changes detailed above. These changes have no impact on the Company's as-reported earnings and -- earnings per share, nor on any of the pro forma information, nor any other information presented in the Form 10-K for the three years ended September 30, 2001.
