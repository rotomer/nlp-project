Exhibit 99(a)FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMay 1, 2003                     THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2003         BURBANK, Calif. - The Walt Disney Company today reported earnings for the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2003.         Revenues increased to $6.3 billion from $5.9 billion in the prior-year quarter, while segment operating income decreased to$646 million from $702 million in the prior-year quarter.  Net income decreased 12% to $229 million from $259 million in theprior-year quarter.  Earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.11 versus $0.13 in the prior-year quarter.         For the six months, revenues increased to $13.8 billion from $12.9 billion in the prior-year period, while segmentoperating income decreased to $1.4 billion from $1.5 billion in the prior-year period. Net income and earnings per share decreasedto $485 million and $0.24, respectively, from $697 million and $0.34, respectively, in the prior-year period. Results for the sixmonths include the first quarter pre-tax charge of $114 million ($0.04 per share) for the write-off of an investment in aircraftleveraged leases with United Airlines. The prior-year six-month period results include a $216 million ($0.07 per share) 1 pre-taxgain on the sale of investments recorded in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.         "The military conflict in Iraq and fear of terrorism have clearly had a near-term impact on a number of our businesses.While many of the factors affecting the Company are not within our control, we feel confident that the plans and strategies that wehave in place will put the Company in a solid position when economic conditions improve," said Michael Eisner, Disney chairman andCEO.  "At the same time, we are pleased with the strong creative and financial success at the Studio and the positive reception ofour new product offerings at Disney's California Adventure.  As long as we continue to provide great entertainment and manage ourbusinesses well, Disney will prosper over the long run."Operating ResultsMedia Networks         Media Networks revenues for the quarter increased to $2.5 billion, versus $2.2 billion in the prior-year quarter, whilesegment operating income decreased to $232 million versus $309 million in the prior-year quarter.  See Table A for further detail ofMedia Networks results.1 Due to rounding, the impact of the Knight-Ridder gain was $0.06 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and $0.07 for thesix months and full year.
Lower Broadcast results were driven by higher programming and production expenses, partially offset by higher advertisingrevenues.  Increased programming expenses were due to higher NFL costs for the Super Bowl broadcast, and higher primetime seriescosts.  Higher production expenses reflected increased news production costs as a result of war coverage.         Increased advertising revenues reflected higher rates attributable in part to the Super Bowl, partially offset bypreemptions of regular programming due to war coverage. The Company estimates that the total operating income impact of the warcoverage in the quarter was approximately $32 million, resulting from increased costs from the coverage and the loss of advertisingrevenue as a result of preemptions of regular programming. The war coverage has extended into the Company's third fiscal quarter andthe cost for that coverage is estimated at an additional $15 to $20 million.         Cable results increased versus the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher rates and advertising revenues, largely offset byincreased sports programming, primarily NBA and NFL, and marketing costs.  Cable results were also impacted by the bankruptcy ofDirecTV in Latin America, which is the Company's major distributor in that region.  Higher marketing costs reflected brandinginitiatives at the ABC Family Channel.Parks and Resorts         Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter of $1.5 billion were down somewhat versus the prior-year quarter and segmentoperating income decreased to $155 million from $280 million in the prior-year quarter.
Parks and Resorts results primarily reflected lower theme park attendance and hotel occupancy at the Walt Disney WorldResort and higher costs at both Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. These attendance decreases and higher costs werepartially offset by increased guest spending at Walt Disney World, as well as higher hotel occupancy and theme park attendance atDisneyland. Decreased attendance and hotel occupancy at Walt Disney World reflected disruption in travel and tourism due to concernsabout world events and softness in the economy as a whole, as well as the timing of Easter, which occurred during the third quarterof the current year but in the second quarter of the prior year. Higher costs at both resorts were driven by higher spending oninformation systems and increased costs for refurbishments, employee benefits, insurance, depreciation and marketing, partiallyoffset by ongoing cost management efforts.         At Walt Disney World, the increase in guest spending reflected ticket and certain other price increases in the fourthquarter of the prior year, as well as a reduction in certain promotional programs.  Higher hotel occupancy at Disneyland was drivenby promotional programs offered during the current quarter.  Increased attendance at Disneyland reflected the continued success ofthe Annual Passport program, as well as the opening of new attractions and entertainment at Disney's California Adventure, including"a bug's land" in the first quarter of the current year and "Disney's Aladdin - A Musical Spectacular" in the second quarter.Studio Entertainment         Studio Entertainment revenues increased to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion in the prior-year quarter and segment operatingincome increased to $206 million from $27 million in the prior-year quarter.
Studio Entertainment results for the quarter primarily reflected growth in worldwide home video and televisiondistribution. Worldwide home video results reflected strong DVD and VHS performances of Sweet Home Alabama, Signs and Spy Kids 2:The Island of Lost Dreams. The improvement in television distribution reflected higher network sales from such titles as Gone in 60Seconds, Peter Pan II: Return to Never Land and Disney's The Kid as well as higher domestic syndication revenues in the currentquarter. Worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution results for the quarter were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Thecurrent quarter included strong performances by Bringing Down the House, Chicago and Shanghai Knights, while the prior-year quarterincluded Disney/Pixar's Monsters, Inc. in the international markets.Consumer Products         Revenues for the quarter decreased to $500 million from $580 million in the prior-year quarter, and segment operatingincome decreased to $53 million from $86 million in the prior-year quarter.         Consumer Products results for the quarter were driven by decreased sales at the Disney Stores, reflecting a soft retailmarket in North America and the sale of the Disney Store business in Japan during the third quarter of the prior year.  Merchandiselicensing benefited from increased earned royalties in direct-to-retail licenses.Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses         Corporate and unallocated shared expenses were essentially flat from the prior-year quarter as additional costs for newfinance and human resource information technology systems, were offset by lower costs from brand promotion initiatives.
Net Interest Expense         Net interest expense was as follows:                                                                                   Quarter Ended                                                                                     March 31,                                                                       ---------------------------------------(unaudited, in millions)                                                    2003                   2002                                                                       ----------------       ----------------Interest expense                                                               (172)                  (182)                                                                                                $                      $Interest and investment income (loss)                                           (66)                    24                                                                           ------------           ------------Net interest expense                                                           (178)                  (158)                                                                                                $                      $                                                                           ============           ============         Net interest expense increased to $178 million from $158 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decrease ininterest and investment income, partially offset by lower interest expense. Lower investment income reflected investment losses inthe current period compared to gains in the prior-year period. Decreased interest expense primarily resulted from lower average debtbalances and lower interest rates.Equity in the Income of Investees         Income from equity investees, consisting primarily of Euro Disney, A&E Television, Lifetime Television and E! EntertainmentTelevision, increased to $51 million from $49 million in the prior-year quarter due to increases at the cable equity investments,partially offset by declines at Euro Disney.

Exhibit 99(b)Earnings  Release  Conference Call  Presentation on May 1, 2003 by Michael D. Eisner,  Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer;  Robert A. Iger,  President,  and Thomas O. Staggs,  Senior  Executive Vice President and Chief  FinancialOfficer of The Walt Disney CompanyThomas O. Staggs:As expected, our results last quarter for our theme park and Disney Store operations were affected by thedifficult economy and the disruption in travel resulting from fear of terrorism and the war in Iraq.  At the sametime, we were extremely pleased with the continued success at the Studio and encouraged by results in ourlicensing business.The effects of the travel downturn have been felt in varying degrees across our theme park properties, althoughour focus on cost containment continues to help lessen the impact.  At Walt Disney World, attendance for thequarter was down roughly 7% from the prior year, although per capita spending remained strong -- as it has forthe past several quarters -- with gains of around 3% over the prior year.  At Disneyland Resort, attendanceincreased modestly, driven by strong local attendance and the growing popularity of Disney's CaliforniaAdventure.So far for the third fiscal quarter, our advance bookings are still extremely close in, making visibility intothe summer period substantially less clear than it would usually be.At Walt Disney World, reservations for guests visiting in the next few weeks have recently increased.   However,looking at the June quarter as a whole, reservations on the books at Walt Disney World are still meaningfullydown versus where we stood at this time last year.  Disneyland bookings, on the other hand, are still trackingsomewhat ahead of last year.At Disney Cruise Line we continue to see solid results.  March quarter occupancies and load factors were on parwith the prior year, and so far this quarter that trend continues.   Reservations on the books for our cruisebusiness are also in line with last year.Turning now to Media Networks, in Broadcasting we estimate the total operating income impact of covering the warto be roughly $50 million, with approximately $32 million of that falling into the second quarter.  The net costfor the Super Bowl during the quarter also resulted in a more difficult comparison to last year.  On the otherhand, the strength we've seen in the advertising market throughout the season continued into the second quarter,with primetime scatter market rates roughly 25% above upfront levels.  And, as has been the case over the pastseveral periods, advertisers have been picking up more than 90% of their options.At our television stations, pacings for the second quarter were up by mid-to-high single digits.  At radio, wehave seen some relative softness in network ad sales, although advertising at our radio stations was up for thequarter versus the prior year.In our cable businesses, results suffered from the bankruptcy of one of our international distributors -- DirectTV Latin America -- representing roughly a $35 million downside this quarter.  Despite this impact, our cablebusiness as a whole grew 5% for the quarter, led by strong gains at ESPN.  We've made substantial investments inprogramming at ESPN -- especially in the acquisition of sports rights like the NBA - and we believe we haveincreased value to both viewers and the distributors who carry the ESPN suite of channels.  While we will seesome near-term margin compression in the third quarter, we believe these investments will help drive growth inthis business over time.  Results at Toon Disney and SOAPnet have also shown growth, as those channels continueto gain both subscribers and advertising dollars.At Consumer Products, the Disney Stores suffered from the overall weakness felt across retail in general and thespecialty retail industry specifically.   Results also reflected last year's sale of the Disney Stores in Japan,which added to difficult comparisons.  However, we are continuing to see improving fundamentals in our licensingbusiness, where we are increasingly emphasizing the development and distribution of product through massretailers.  In our softlines division in particular, higher earned revenues from new direct-to-retail deals arecontributing to our momentum in licensing.The highlight of the March quarter was clearly the success of our Studio operations, reflecting not only creativeachievement, but also our focus on the profitability and capital returns of film projects as a key measure ofsuccess.   Two excellent examples of this approach were "Bringing Down the House," which is currently intheaters, and "Sweet Home Alabama," currently in release on video and DVD.  Each film cost roughly $35 million toproduce.  "Sweet Home Alabama" generated more than $125 million at the domestic box office and is well on its wayto selling more than 8 million units in video and DVD.  We expect that the film will ultimately deliver totalprofit to the company of more than $130 million.  The success thus far of "Bringing Down the House" indicatesthat it too will be a strong contributor to our returns.At this point, we believe that the impact of the soft environment will continue to be felt at the Parks and ourStores during the third quarter.  However, we're encouraged by the move toward resolution in Iraq and pleased tosee the recent increase in consumer confidence.   And, we're hoping to see that translate into increasedbookings, an upswing in retail spending and stronger year-over-year comparisons in our September quarter as theenvironment improves.Our major summer film releases also represent potentially important swing factors for the balance of our fiscalyear.  These include the Disney/Pixar film "Finding Nemo" and the Disney film "Pirates of the Caribbean - TheCurse of the Black Pearl."As we manage through this difficult period, we will continue to closely focus on our costs and investments.  Atthe same time, we believe we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on improvements in the environment.Here is Bob Iger to talk about some of the work we're doing in that regard.Robert A. Iger:Disney does indeed have a strong foundation from which to deliver long-term growth.  At our theme parks, ournear-term priority is developing marketing initiatives to attract and extend the stay of our visitors, focusingon strong, segment-wide events and key attractions.  We've seen success from our recent additions to Disney'sCalifornia Adventure, including the Aladdin stage show, A Bug's Land and Playhouse Disney Live.   A little over ayear from now, we'll begin celebrating the "50th Anniversary of Disney's Theme Parks" at our domestic andinternational properties.Coupled with this segment-wide event will be a focus on live shows and spectaculars -- large-scale entertainmentevents like Fantasmic!, IllumiNations and Festival of the Lion King -- that can be imported to different parksaround the globe and which we think will "move the needle" in terms of guest ratings, intent to return andoverall attendance.And while our most significant capital investments are behind us, three major attractions will open at our parksover the next several years that we believe will drive increased demand and enhance the entertainment experienceof our guests.  In August, the uniquely Disney attraction Mission: Space, sponsored by HP, soft-opens at EPCOT.I can tell you first hand that this ride is truly one of a kind and extremely exhilarating.   In addition, theTower of Terror at Disney's California Adventure will open its elevator doors next year, and Expedition: EVERESTwill open at Disney's Animal Kingdom in 2006.   And in December, Disney's Pop Century Resort opens, which willadd nearly 3,000 value-priced rooms to the Walt Disney World resort.Despite the difficult retail environment, Consumer Products licensing has experienced success due to amerchandising strategy developed around Disney's classic Princess characters.   Between 2001 and 2002, retailsales of Disney's Princess products grew from roughly $140 million to $700 million, and they are tracking to do$1.3 billion at retail this year.  We are optimistic that this collection will continue to build in the future aswe enter new categories and markets.Beyond products that extend our valuable library franchises, our Consumer Products merchandise portfolio willexpand to include more properties that originated on the Disney Channel, which through its wide distribution anddaily exposure to targeted audiences has the ability to develop sustainable properties with broad appeal.  DisneyChannel's break-out property "Lizzie McGuire" has been a success at retail with apparel, videos and records andwe're looking to replicate this experience with Disney Channel's newest property, "Kim Possible," which will bethe cornerstone of Wal*Mart's "Back-to-School" program this summer.  We believe that new property developmentlike this - and our move to a more active licensing model over the past several years - will help drive positiveresults for our business.At ABC, we have made measurable strides this season across all dayparts.  At the beginning of the season, westated that our goal for primetime was to focus on building one or two nights a week to more competitivepositions.   We accomplished this with our Tuesday and Wednesday night comedies and "The Bachelor," and we intendto build upon this foundation next season.One way we plan to deliver on this is by adding more comedies to our primetime schedule.  The comedy formatrepeats with greater success than dramas and can generate long-term value for the company through syndication.Having improved ABC's schedule last fall and given our enthusiasm for next season's development, we're optimisticthat ABC will be better positioned in the upfront advertising market relative to prior year.  Based on thestrength of the current scatter advertising market and marketplace intelligence, we believe that the broadcastupfront advertising market in aggregate will exceed last season.  And, although it's difficult to predict, we doanticipate healthy increases over last year's pricing across all of ABC's dayparts.Due to a strengthened marketplace for sports coupled with improved ratings, advertising sales for the NHL and NBAplayoffs are both substantially complete.   ESPN's ratings overall have continued to rise - with total day up 11%for the March quarter.  In addition to other programming enhancements, ESPN's carriage of the NBA is making adifference in its first year, with ratings up 54% in its time periods on ESPN and 37% on ABC Sports.In this past quarter, ESPN launched ESPN High Definition and also ESPNMotion - a service that provides ESPNcontent to broadband internet users.  Another service just announced is ESPN Pay per View.   These new servicesadd value not just to the company and to ESPN fans, but also to distributors and those with an interest in seeinggrowth in the adoption of new technologies, like broadband, high definition TV and video-on-demand..While DVD may not represent new, cutting-edge technology, it continues to represent a substantial opportunity forDisney, especially as the devices are purchased by the mainstream family segment - a huge market that is core forour company.  To capitalize on increased penetration, we're making a number of changes to our long-standingmoratorium strategy for our best-loved "Platinum" animation titles.Rather than ten-year release cycles for each Platinum title, we now expect to release two Platinum titles peryear, in March and October, which will effectively condense the cycle to seven years.  This will enable us todistribute all Platinum titles on DVD by 2007 rather than 2010, allowing for a two-year selling window and afive-year period where the title is off the market.  In addition, we plan to expand the Platinum portfolio in2004 -- after the release of our next Platinum title "The Lion King" -- to include "Sleeping Beauty,""Pinocchio," "Peter Pan" and "Fantasia."These initiatives are a sample of the latest ways that we're using our branded content to take advantage of theopportunities that new distribution platforms present.  We believe that these strategies and trends will drivegrowth over the long term.  We are mindful of the near-term challenges still posed by current world events, butas external conditions return to normal, we expect the underlying strength of our assets to propel renewed growth.Michael D. Eisner:I am pleased with the way our management team is responding to the current external challenges, and remainconfident that when the economic upswing comes, Disney will be one of the greatest beneficiaries.  This isbecause the fundamental strength of our brands, characters and creativity remains intact, a fact borne out acrossour businesses this quarter.At our Studio,- --   "Chicago, " winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, passed the $160 million mark in domestic box     office, becoming the highest grossing film in Miramax history;- --   "Bringing Down the House" has exceeded $125 million at the U.S. box office, but more importantly should     drive well over $100 million in ultimate profits;- --   "Holes" opened two weekends ago and, having already grossed $36 million, is providing further evidence     of the continuing strength of Disney-branded films; and- --   This weekend, we will look to continue the growth of the powerful "Lizzie McGuire" franchise with the     release of her first live action film.Later this month, we'll debut the highly anticipated Disney/Pixar film "Finding Nemo," and in early July comesJohnny Depp in the summer event movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, "Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of theBlack Pearl."Our studio is number-one at the U.S. box office so far this year, with a 27% domestic share.  What makes this successtangible is the fact that it is based on moderately budgeted films, resulting in significant gains inprofitability.At Disney Consumer Products,- --   As Bob mentioned, the Princess line continues to perform extremely well; and- --   Baby Einstein is proving to be an outstanding acquisition, opening the way to greater penetration by our     company in the sizeable educational market.At our theme parks, the fundamental appeal of our properties is as strong as it's ever been.In fact, our recent research indicates that the public's intent to visit a Disney theme park within the next 12months is the highest we've seen since we started measuring the statistic 5 years ago.We are especially well poised for growth thanks to the transformation of our Paris, Tokyo and, especially,Anaheim properties into destination resorts.   Disneyland was the park that launched this entire business, but bythe early `90s, the area around it was becoming seriously distressed.  Thanks to a wide-ranging public/privatepartnership, we have fundamentally altered the environment around Disneyland into a garden district that featuresworld-class hotels, a second theme park and Downtown Disney, which has become a major focal point for OrangeCounty.  The new Disneyland Resort represents the culmination of a 15-year strategy to safeguard and expand oneof our greatest single assets.A recent initiative that should drive added performance at our parks is the Disney-branded Visa card that weinaugurated with Bank One during the quarter.  It offers rewards that can be redeemed at our resorts and, in just50 days, more than 150,000 people have already signed up, representing one of the fastest card launches inhistory.So, the fact remains that we are strategically positioned in our core entertainment categories, leaving us wellsituated to capitalize on an improving economy and emerging trends -- especially the development of newtechnologies, such as digital transmission.The transition to digital delivery will have tremendous implications across our businesses -- from media networksto theme parks to film to consumer products. Consider what it will mean for our movie studio.  In the analogworld, this business focuses on a structured sequence of release windows -- from theatrical to video topay-per-view to premium cable to network broadcast to syndication, and so on.  In the digital world, we will beable to rethink this sequencing.  We believe that the immediacy and lower cost base of digital delivery will openup major new markets here in the United States and around the world.We intend to be on the leading edge of the digital wave.  We are working on multiple technologies to distributefilms in a number of new ways -- through the internet and using over-the-air spectrum -- for both limited-viewingrental and for sell-through.We will continue to adapt our product to meet important new consumer trends and to establish long-term sources ofgrowth.   As long as we consistently provide great entertainment and manage it well, our company will prosperthrough all the inevitable business cycles.
