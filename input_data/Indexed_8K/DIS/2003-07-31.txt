THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY                                                                   By:  /s/ ALAN N. BRAVERMAN                                                                        ALAN N.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                                               Exhibit 99(a)July 31, 2003                    THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003         BURBANK, Calif. - The Walt Disney Company today reported earnings for the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2003.         Revenues increased to $6.2 billion from $5.8 billion in the prior-year quarter and segment operating income increased to$846 million from $828 million. Net income increased to $400 million from $364 million in the prior-year quarter and dilutedearnings per share were $0.19 versus $0.18. During the current quarter, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment chargesand a gain on the sale of the Anaheim Angels that offset each other. The prior-year quarter included a pre-tax gain of $34 million($0.01 per share) on the sale of the Disney Store business in Japan.         For the nine months, revenues increased to $20.0 billion from $18.7 billion in the prior-year period, while segmentoperating income remained flat at $2.3 billion. Net income and earnings per share decreased to $885 million and $0.43, respectively,from $1.1 billion and $0.52, respectively, in the prior-year period. Results for the nine months also include the first quarterpre-tax charge of $114 million ($0.04 per share) for the write-off of an investment in aircraft leveraged leases with UnitedAirlines. The prior-year nine-month period results also include a $216 million ($0.07 per share) pre-tax gain on the sale ofinvestments recorded in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.         "I am pleased to see improvements in our financial results, which I expect to accelerate over the next 12 to 18 months,"said Michael Eisner, Disney chairman and CEO. "Disney's overarching strategy is to create great entertainment product with strongfranchise potential and to extend that product prudently across our broad array of programming, theme park and other consumerproduct outlets. Our two most recent theatrical films exemplify that approach. The Disney/Pixar release Finding Nemo, with well over$300 million in domestic box office receipts, and the Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean, which has grossed over$185 million in just three weeks, promise to contribute to our results in both the near term and for years to come."Operating ResultsMedia Networks         Media Networks revenues for the quarter increased to $2.5 billion from $2.1 billion in the prior-year quarter, whilesegment operating income increased to $384 million from $288 million. See Table A for further detail of Media Networks results.Due to rounding, the impact of the Knight-Ridder gain was $0.06 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and $0.07  for the nine months and full year.
Improved Broadcast results were driven by lower cost programming, including a number of new series at the ABC televisionnetwork, and by higher advertising revenues. Increased advertising revenues reflected higher rates due to an improved advertisingmarketplace for the ABC television network and for the Company's owned television stations. Additionally, the prior-year quarterbenefited from insurance proceeds related to the loss of a broadcast tower.         Cable operating income declined somewhat, reflecting higher programming costs at ESPN, due principally to the NBA contractcosts, which were only partially offset by incremental NBA-related advertising revenues. Additionally, the quarter reflected higheraffiliate revenue due to both subscriber growth and contractual rate adjustments.Parks and Resorts         Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter decreased to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion in the prior-year quarter, andsegment operating income decreased to $352 million from $467 million.         Parks and Resorts results were driven principally by declines in hotel occupancy and theme park attendance at the WaltDisney World Resort in Florida. Decreased hotel occupancy and theme park attendance at Walt Disney World reflected continueddisruption in travel and tourism, partially offset by the timing of Easter vacation, as the holiday occurred during the thirdquarter of the current year compared to the second quarter of the prior year. The attendance and occupancy declines were partiallyoffset by higher guest spending due to ticket and other price increases in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
At Disneyland, higher attendance and occupancy were offset by decreased guest spending and cost increases due to marketingefforts, higher employee benefits and new product offerings. The attendance and occupancy growth at Disneyland reflected theResident Salute program, the Annual Passport program and the 5-for-3 Day Disneyland Resort Park hopper, as well as the opening ofnew attractions and entertainment venues. Declines in spending were due to ticket mix.         Additionally, results for the quarter reflected the elimination of royalties and management fees from Euro Disney as aresult of the Company's agreement with Euro Disney as discussed below.         During the quarter, the Company completed its sale of the Anaheim Angels baseball team. The sale resulted in a $16 milliongain that is reported in gain on the sale of business in the consolidated statements of income.Studio Entertainment         Studio Entertainment revenues increased 5% to $1.4 billion and segment operating income increased to $71 million from $22million in the prior-year quarter.         Studio Entertainment results for the quarter were primarily driven by improvements in domestic theatrical motion picturedistribution and international home video, partially offset by declines in domestic television distribution.
Domestic theatrical motion picture distribution results improved on the strength of the successful release ofDisney/Pixar's Finding Nemo. Growth in international home video was driven by strong DVD sales, while the decline in domestictelevision distribution primarily reflected lower syndication revenues.Consumer Products         Revenues for the quarter increased to $497 million from $457 million in the prior-year quarter and segment operating incomedecreased to $39 million from $51 million in the prior-year quarter.         Consumer Products results for the quarter were driven by decreases at the Disney Store, reflecting lower operating marginsin North America as a result of promotional sales during the quarter. Additionally, Consumer Products results reflected higheradministrative costs associated with the initiation of a brand management program, partially offset by increased publishing results.Merchandise licensing results were comparable to the prior-year quarter and reflected increased earned royalties fromdirect-to-retail licenses in the current quarter.         During the quarter, the Company announced that it is pursuing strategic options for the Disney Store in North America andEurope, which may include a sale of the stores. In connection with this activity, the Company expects to continue closing a numberof underperforming stores. During the quarter, the Company recorded charges totaling $15 million for fixed asset write-downs relatedto the stores in North America that it expects to close and for the cost of administrative headcount reductions. The charge isreported in restructuring and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income. As store closures occur, we expect toincur additional charges related to lease termination costs and other actions that may be taken in connection with the dispositionof the stores.
Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses         Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased to $117 million from $76 million in the prior-year quarter, reflectingadditional costs associated with new finance and human resource information technology systems. Additionally, the prior-year quarterexpenses were partially offset by gains on the sale of properties in the U.K.Net Interest Expense and Other         Net interest expense and other was as follows:                                                                                   Quarter Ended                                                                                      June 30,                                                                       ---------------------------------------(unaudited, in millions)                                                    2003                   2002                                                                       ----------------       ----------------Interest expense                                                          $      (160)           $      (187)Interest and investment income (loss)                                              (8)                     2                                                                           -----------            -----------Net interest expense and other                                            $      (168)           $      (185)                                                                           ===========            ===========         Net interest expense decreased to $168 million from $185 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower averagedebt balances, partially offset by a loss incurred on the early retirement of Company debt securities.Equity in the Income of Investees         Income from equity investees, consisting primarily of Euro Disney, A&E Television, Lifetime Television and E! EntertainmentTelevision, increased to $102 million from $44 million in the prior-year quarter due to increases at the cable equity investments inthe current quarter and the write-down of an investment in a Latin American cable operator in the prior-year quarter.
Euro Disney Investment         Due to the slowdown in the European travel and tourism industry and its impact on Euro Disney's operations, on March 28,2003 the Company agreed with Euro Disney not to charge royalties and management fees for the period from January 1, 2003 toSeptember 30, 2003, to the extent needed for Euro Disney to comply with a bank covenant regarding its operating income.         During the third quarter, the travel and tourism situation in Europe worsened, and was exacerbated by strikes and workstoppages in France. This situation negatively impacted Euro Disney to a greater extent than expected at the end of the lastquarter. As a result of these recent trends, Euro Disney has advised the Company that it no longer expects to achieve its previouslyprojected levels of theme park attendance and hotel occupancy. Consequently, Euro Disney no longer expects to be in compliance withits bank covenants for fiscal 2003 or 2004, despite last quarter's agreement by the Company to reduce royalties and management feesdescribed above. Based on these results, the Company will not collect any additional royalties and fees related to fiscal 2003.         In response to this situation, Euro Disney has initiated discussions with its agent banks and the Company to obtain thenecessary covenant waivers or modifications and to obtain supplemental financing to address Euro Disney's cash requirements with thegoal of resolving these matters over the next several months. Such financing may include an extension or change in other termsassociated with the Company's credit line or additional commitments from the Company. Without supplemental financing, Euro Disney nolonger expects to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations in fiscal 2004, including the repayment of theCompany's credit line. In the absence of obtaining the covenant waivers or modifications, Euro Disney lenders could accelerate thematurity of Euro Disney's debt, and should that occur, Euro Disney would be unable to meet its obligations. Should Euro Disney beunable to obtain the covenant waivers or modifications and additional financing, some or all of the Company's $522 million EuroDisney investment and receivables would likely become impaired. The Company believes that Euro Disney will ultimately obtain therequisite covenant waivers or modifications and additional financing; however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will besuccessful.
Fourth Quarter Accounting Change         EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21) becomes effective in the fiscal fourthquarter. This new accounting rule addresses revenue recognition for revenues derived from a single contract that contains multipleproducts or services. The rule provides additional requirements as to when such revenues may be recorded separately for accountingpurposes. Historically, the Company has recognized the NFL broadcast portion of ESPN's affiliate revenue when the NFL games wereaired, as ESPN's affiliate contracts provided a basis for allocating such revenue between NFL and non-NFL programming. Underseparate accounting rules, the cost of the NFL rights has also been recognized as the games were aired. Accordingly, the Company hasrecognized both the NFL revenues and NFL costs in the quarters the games were aired.         Under EITF 00-21's requirements for separating the revenue elements of a single contract, the Company will no longer beallocating ESPN's affiliate revenue between NFL and non-NFL programming for accounting purposes. As a consequence, the Company willno longer be able to match NFL revenue with NFL costs as all ESPN affiliate revenue (including the NFL portion) will be recognizedratably throughout the year, while NFL contract costs must continue to be recognized in the quarters the games are aired. Thisaccounting change impacts only the timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on cash flow. As a result of this change, theMedia Networks segment will report significantly reduced revenue and profitability in the first fiscal quarter when the majority ofthe NFL games are aired, with commensurately increased revenues and profits in the second and third fiscal quarters. The impact onthe fourth fiscal quarter is less significant due to the fewer number of games.         The Company is electing to adopt this new accounting rule using the cumulative effect approach. In the fourth quarter, theCompany will record an after-tax charge of $71 million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting as of the beginning offiscal year 2003. This amount represents the revenue recorded for NFL games in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 which wouldhave been recorded ratably over fiscal 2003 under the new accounting method. The following table shows the effect on the first threequarters of fiscal year 2003 had the Company been on this new accounting method.

The increase in revenues and net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the new accounting           method's ratable recognition of affiliate revenue throughout the year (for NFL games aired in the fourth quarter of           fiscal 2002 and first quarter of fiscal 2003) will be offset by the impact of not recognizing NFL revenues that, under           the historical method, the Company would have recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as the games are aired.Note 2     The accounting change has no impact on the Company's cash flows.
