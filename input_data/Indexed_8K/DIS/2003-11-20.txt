Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.20, up from $0.09 in the prior-year fourth quarter.  For the year, EPSbefore a required accounting change was $0.65 versus $0.60 in the prior year.         Earnings per share for the fourth  quarter and the full year include an  approximate  $0.03 EPS benefit from the  favorablesettlement  of certain  state tax  issues.  Earnings  per share for the full year also  include a $0.04  negative  impact due to thewrite-off of an investment  in aircraft  leveraged  leases.  The  prior-year  EPS includes a $0.07 benefit from gains on the sale ofinvestments and the Disney Store Japan.
"Disney's strong performance in the quarter,  driven by the Studios and Media Networks, and the substantial  improvement inour overall  results during a difficult year provide  further  evidence that we have  established the foundation for future growth,"said Michael Eisner, chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company. "The Walt Disney Studios' quarter was especially noteworthy, sinceits success was founded on the creation of new franchises, such as 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' that can provide returns for years tocome. Looking ahead, we feel confident in our ability to deliver solid growth for fiscal 2004."         Improved  operating  performance  for the quarter was driven by  increases in Studio  Entertainment,  Media  Networks,  andConsumer  Products,  offset  somewhat by declines in Parks and  Resorts.  Results  for the year  reflected  strong  growth at StudioEntertainment  and Media Networks,  partially  offset by declines at Parks and Resorts and a modest  decrease at Consumer  Products.         Revenues,  segment  operating  income,  net income  and  earnings  per share for the year and  quarter  are as follows  (inmillions):                                                   Year Ended                          Quarter Ended                                                 September 30,                         September 30,                                       ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------                                           2003         2002      % Change       2003        2002     % Change                                       ------------------------------------ ------------------------- -----------Revenues                                $ 27,061     $ 25,329         7 %     $  7,014     $ 6,662          5 %Segment operating income                   3,174        2,822        12 %          830         539         54 %Income before the cumulative  effect of accounting change              1,338        1,236         8 %          415         175        137 %Net income                                 1,267        1,236         3 %          415         175        137 %Diluted earnings per share  before the cumulative effect of  accounting change                     $   0.65     $   0.60         8 %     $   0.20     $  0.09        122 %Diluted earnings per share              $   0.62     $   0.60         3 %     $   0.20     $  0.09        122 %
Operating ResultsStudio Entertainment         Studio Entertainment revenues for the year increased 10% to $7.4 billion, while segment operating income more than doubledto $620 million from $273 million.  For the quarter, revenues increased 9% to $2.2 billion and segment operating income increased to$205 million from $75 million.         Studio Entertainment results for the year and quarter reflected strong growth in both domestic and international theatricalmotion picture distribution, television distribution and domestic home video, partially offset by higher development and productionwrite-offs.  Domestic and international theatrical motion picture distribution results reflected successful performances byDisney/Pixar's Finding Nemo, Sweet Home Alabama, Santa Clause 2 and Bringing Down the House, as well as the fourth quarter releasesof Pirates of the Caribbean and Freaky Friday, compared to the prior year which included a film write-down.  Improvements intelevision distribution reflected better performance of film product sales to television networks and to the pay television market.Growth in domestic home video reflected strong DVD and VHS performances of Lilo & Stitch, Sweet Home Alabama, Signs and Beauty andthe Beast, as well as fourth quarter DVD and VHS releases, which included Chicago, Bringing Down the House and Gangs of New York.         Higher segment operating income for the quarter was partially offset by declines in international home video reflectingstronger performing titles in the prior-year, which included Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Disney/Pixar's Monsters, Inc.
Media Networks         Media Networks revenues for the year increased 12% to $10.9 billion, and segment operating income increased 23% to $1.2billion.  For the quarter, revenues increased 8% to $2.6 billion and segment operating income increased to $298 million from $147million in the prior year.  See Table A for further detail of Media Networks results.         For the year, the Media Networks segment benefited from a stronger advertising market and higher cable affiliate fees. Forthe quarter, these same factors led to improved results at our cable networks, while higher programming and production costsnegatively affected broadcasting results.         Broadcasting results for the year were driven by higher advertising revenues, partially offset by increased programming andproduction costs.  Increased advertising revenues reflected higher rates due to an improved advertising marketplace for the ABCtelevision network, the Company's owned television and radio stations and the ABC radio networks.  The airing of the Super Bowl inthe second quarter of the current year contributed to increases in both advertising revenues and programming costs.  Year to yearcomparisons were also negatively impacted by the cost of coverage of the war in Iraq and the previously disclosed receipt ofinsurance proceeds in the prior year.         Lower broadcasting results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to increased programming costs for more expensiveseries and higher sports programming and production costs due to additional NFL broadcasts in the current quarter, partially offsetby increases in advertising and syndication revenue.
Increased cable results for the year reflected higher affiliate and advertising revenue, partially offset by increasedsports programming costs, primarily for National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball broadcasts, and higher programmingcosts at ABC Family.  Higher affiliate revenue was due to both contractual rate adjustments and subscriber growth.  The increase forthe year also reflected negative impacts in the prior year related to the financial difficulties of Adelphia Communications andKirchMedia.         Improved cable results for the fourth quarter were primarily driven by lower cost  amortization for the NFL contract due tocommencing the three year option period of the contract,  as well as higher advertising and affiliate revenues,  partially offset byhigher programming costs at ABC Family and start-up costs at the Disney Channel in Japan. Higher affiliate revenue was due primarilyto contractual rate adjustments and subscriber growth.         Increased cable results for both the year and quarter were negatively affected by the bankruptcy of DirecTV in LatinAmerica, which is the Company's major distributor in that region.Parks and Resorts         Parks and Resorts revenue for the year decreased 1% to $6.4 billion and segment operating income decreased 18% to $957million.  For the quarter, revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion and segment operating income decreased 4% to $225 million.         Parks and Resorts results for the year primarily reflected lower hotel occupancy and theme park attendance and higher costsat the Walt Disney World Resort, partially offset by higher guest spending.  Decreased hotel occupancy and theme park attendance atWalt Disney World reflected continued softness in travel and tourism.  Higher costs at Walt Disney World were driven by higherspending on employee benefits, marketing, refurbishments, information systems, depreciation and insurance.  Despite a continuingfocus on cost control, employee benefit costs, including pension expenses, are expected to continue to increase in fiscal 2004.Guest spending increases primarily reflected ticket price increases in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Both the year and quarter were negatively impacted by the elimination of royalties and management fees from Euro Disneybeginning in the second quarter of the current year.         For the quarter, declines driven by the elimination of Euro Disney fees were partially offset by gradual recovery at theWalt Disney World Resort.  The improved results at Walt Disney World primarily reflected higher hotel occupancy and theme parkattendance, partially offset by lower guest spending due to special ticketing and other promotional programs offered during thequarter.  Occupancy and attendance gains for the quarter were primarily due to higher domestic tourist and local guest visitation.         For both the year and quarter, results for the Disneyland Resort were slightly down compared to the prior year, reflectinghigher costs, partially offset by higher hotel occupancy, theme park attendance and guest spending.Consumer Products         Consumer Products revenues for the year decreased 4% to $2.3 billion and segment operating income decreased 3% to $384million.  Revenues for the quarter decreased 2% to $560 million and segment operating income increased 24% to $102 million.         Results for the year were driven by decreases at the Disney Store, partially offset by increases in merchandise licensing.Declines at the Disney Store reflected lower comparative store sales and decreased margins in North America and the sale of theDisney Store business in Japan during the third quarter of the prior year.  Merchandise licensing increases were due primarily tostrong performance of toy licenses driven by new properties and classic characters, including Winnie the Pooh, Disney Princesses,Power Rangers and Finding Nemo and increased royalties from direct-to-retail softlines licenses.
Results for the quarter reflected strong growth in merchandise licensing due to stronger performance from toy licenses,which more than offset the decrease at the Disney Store, which was due to lower margins from promotional sales and markdowns.         The Company is continuing to pursue, as planned, the sale and disposition of the Disney Store.Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses         Corporate and unallocated  shared  expenses  increased 6% to $443 million for the year and increased 6% to $148 million forthe quarter.  The increase for the year  reflected  additional  costs  associated  with new finance and human  resource  informationtechnology  systems,  partially offset by lower brand promotion and litigation costs. The prior year also included gains on the saleof properties in the U.K. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to higher legal costs. Information technology systems costsfor the fourth quarter were comparable to the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Expense         Net interest expense was as follows (in millions):                                                               Year Ended                  Quarter Ended                                                              September 30,                 September 30,                                                       ---------------------------   --------------------------                                                          2003           2002           2003          2002                                                       -------------  ------------   ------------  ------------Interest expense                                       $     (666)    $    (708)     $    (139)    $    (170)United Airlines investment write-off                         (114)            -              -             -Gain on the sale of Knight-Ridder  shares                                                        -           216              -             -Interest and investment income (loss)                         (13)           39              5             5                                                           ---------     ---------      ---------     ---------Net interest expense                                   $     (793)    $    (453)     $    (134)    $    (165)                                                           =========     =========      =========     =========         Interest expense decreased by 6% to $666 million and by 18% to $139 million for the year and quarter, respectively, drivenby lower interest rates and average debt balances.  Net interest expense increased from $453 million to $793 million for the year anddecreased from $165 million to $134 million for the quarter.  The year-over-year comparison of net interest expense is substantiallyimpacted by the $114 million write-off of leveraged leases on commercial aircraft in the current year and the $216 million gain onthe sale of the Company's shares of Knight-Ridder in the prior year.
Equity in the Income of Investees         Income from equity investees, consisting primarily of Euro Disney, A&E Television, Lifetime Television and E! EntertainmentTelevision,  increased  48% to $334 million for the year and 47% to $91 million for the quarter.  The increase for both the year andthe quarter were driven by increases at Lifetime, A&E and E! Entertainment  Television.  Increases at Lifetime reflected the absenceof certain  advertising  expenses that were  reflected in prior-year  results.  Results at A&E and E! reflected  higher  advertisingrevenues. Additionally, equity income in the prior year included the write-down of an investment in a Latin American cable operator.Income Taxes         The effective income tax rate decreased from 39%to 35% for the year and from 33% to 27% for the fourth quarter.  Thedecreases in the current year and quarter were principally due to the favorable resolution of certain prior-year state income taxexposures.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow         Total and net borrowings decreased by 7% and 11%, to $13.1 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, as detailed below (inmillions).

See the discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics that follows below.         The decrease in net borrowings was driven by strong cash flow from operations totaling $2.9 billion for the year, which was$615 million or 27% higher than the prior year.         Free cash flow for the year is detailed below (in millions).

See the discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics that follows below.
The increase in free cash flow was driven by a smaller increase in accounts receivable than in the prior year and higherearnings adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher film and television production spending.         Investments in parks, resorts and other property were slightly below $1.1 billion for the year, down modestly from fiscal2002.

The agreement isexpected to give Euro  Disney,  its lenders and the Company time to find a  resolution  to Euro  Disney's  financial  situation.  Inconjunction  with the bank  waivers,  the Company has provided a new 45 million  Euros ($52 million at September  30, 2003  exchangerates) subordinated credit facility to Euro Disney, which can be drawn on through March 31, 2004 only after the existing 168 millionEuros ($192 million at September 30, 2003 exchange rates) standby facility provided by the Company to Euro Disney is fully drawn.
If a timely resolution to Euro Disney's future financing needs is not obtained,  the waivers would expire,  and the Companyand Euro Disney believe Euro Disney would be unable to meet all of its debt obligations. In such an eventuality,  some or all of theCompany's $494 million Euro Disney  investment and receivables  would likely become impaired.  The Company believes that Euro Disneywill ultimately be successful in addressing its financing  requirements;  however, there can be no assurance that these efforts willbe successful.Accounting Change         The Company adopted EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21) in the fiscal fourthquarter of 2003.  This new accounting rule addresses the recognition of revenues derived from a single contract that containsmultiple products or services.  The rule provides additional requirements to determine when such revenues may be recorded separatelyfor accounting purposes.  Historically, the Company has recognized the NFL broadcast portion of ESPN's affiliate revenues when theNFL games were aired, as ESPN's affiliate contracts provided a basis for allocating such revenue between NFL and non-NFLprogramming.  Under separate accounting rules, the cost of the NFL rights has also been recognized as the games were aired.Accordingly, the Company recognized both the NFL revenues and NFL costs in the quarters the games were aired.         Under EITF 00-21's  requirements  for  separating  the revenue  elements of a single  contract,  the Company will no longerallocate ESPN's affiliate revenue between NFL and non-NFL programming for accounting purposes. As a consequence, the Company will nolonger match NFL revenue with NFL costs, as ESPN affiliate revenue (including the NFL portion) will be recognized ratably throughoutthe year,  while NFL contract  costs will  continue to be  recognized in the quarters the games are aired.  This  accounting  changeimpacts  only the timing of revenue  recognition  and has no impact on cash flow.  As a result of this  change,  the Media  Networkssegment will report significantly  reduced revenue and profitability in the first fiscal quarter, when the majority of the NFL gamesare aired, with commensurately increased revenues and profits in the second and third fiscal quarters.
The Company has elected to adopt this new accounting rule using the cumulative effect approach.  Thus, during the fourthquarter, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $71 million for the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of thebeginning of fiscal year 2003.  This amount represents the revenue recorded for NFL games in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002,which has been recorded ratably over fiscal 2003 under the new accounting method.         The following table shows the quarterly effect on fiscal 2003 had the Company been following this new accounting methodthroughout fiscal 2003.

FIN 46         In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation ofVariable Interest Entities (FIN 46) and amended it in October 2003, such that it is now effective for the Company in the firstquarter of fiscal 2004.  Variable interest entities (VIEs) are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activitieswithout additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability.  All of acompany's VIEs must be evaluated under methods prescribed by this interpretation to determine the primary beneficiary of the risksand rewards of the VIE.  The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes.         The current FIN 46 guidance is still  evolving  with several  critical  proposed  adjustments  recently  issued  through anexposure draft. While we continue to evaluate the total impact of FIN 46, based on the current draft the Company anticipates that itwill likely be required to consolidate Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.Non-GAAP Financial Metrics         This earnings release presents net borrowings, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating income which are importantfinancial metrics for the Company, but are not GAAP defined metrics.         Net borrowings - The Company believes that net borrowings provides investors with useful information because we do notimmediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt and net debt represents an important measure that reflects thetotal amount of cash and cash equivalents potentially available to repay borrowings when they mature or when other circumstancesarise.  Furthermore, because we earn interest on our cash balances, net debt can be used to gauge net interest costs.  We do notexpect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay indebtedness in the ordinary course, but may use asubstantial portion of cash and cash equivalents to repay debt depending on the amount of cash and cash equivalents availablerelative to our other current and anticipated uses of cash and the terms of our indebtedness.
Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash flow from operations less investments in parks, resorts and otherproperties) among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash available for purposes other thancapital expenditures.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available toservice debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and pay dividends.         Aggregate  segment  operating  income - The Company  evaluates the  performance of its operating  segments based on segmentoperating income,  and management uses aggregate  segment  operating income as a measure of the performance of operating  businessesseparate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing themto evaluate  changes in the  operating  results of the Company's  portfolio of businesses  separate from factors other than businessoperations that affect net income,  thus providing  separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reportedresults.         These measures should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternativemeasures of borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Net borrowings, free cash flow and aggregatesegment operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Exhibit 99(b)Text of Conference Call Presentation by Executives of the Registrant on November 20, 2003Michael D. EisnerAs we close the books on fiscal year 2003, our company finds itself in a strong position.  We saw significantupsides in the Studios, while some other businesses faced challenges that are the ongoing focus of ourattention.We are very pleased with the tremendous gains in the fourth quarter and the solid results for the year.   Moreimportantly, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong growth into 2004.Our vision for Disney's growth and success is based on how well we do three basic things: create profitableentertainment franchises that people love, aggressively pursue technological innovation that enhances how wecreate and deliver that content to our audiences,  and strengthen and capitalize on the competitive advantage ofour brands and creative properties.And, we continue to make cost containment and productivity essential underpinnings in everything we do.Indeed, during the economic downturn, we have made operations more efficient across the company, which shouldcontribute to our growth as economic conditions improve.In 2003, we launched or expanded on a range of entertainment franchises, from Pirates of the Caribbean to FindingNemo to Freaky Friday to Kim Possible to Lizzie McGuire to our Disney and ESPN cable channels to new offerings atour parks.Our technology strategy is all about innovation and keeping ahead of the curve of new opportunity.  Ourtechnology initiatives spanned all of our lines of business, including MovieBeam, HDTV, Broadband and ourproprietary Internet technology for streaming video called Motion, which was developed by our solidly profitableWalt Disney Internet Group.
At ESPN, we've launched ESPN HD, which will not only continue to build and drive the ESPN brand, but will helpdrive the entire industry toward the adoption of this new medium.But we aren't just using technology to improve the delivery of our content ... we are also using it to improve thecontent of our content.  For example, new attractions like Mission:  Space and the 3-D Mickey's PhilharMagic inOrlando demonstrate our ability to leverage technology to engage audiences in dazzling new ways.All of these initiatives could lead to important growth as we continue to pursue the opportunities of the digitaltransformation of the entertainment industry.As for the third element of our strategic vision - building and strengthening our brands - this is something wesingle-mindedly pursue at all levels.  Two days ago, Bob Iger was in Japan launching our 22nd internationalDisney Channel.  That same day, I was at Walt Disney World for the kick-off of our celebration of Mickey Mouse's75th anniversary.  We may have been on two sides of the globe, but we were both participating in our company'sunique ability to expand and capitalize on our world class entertainment assets.The Studios' stellar success during the year demonstrated the validity of our three-part strategy.  It created orbuilt on fantastic entertainment franchises, it used cutting-edge technology to create compelling entertainmentand it strengthened and broadened the Disney brand.Our other businesses are also showing encouraging signs.  During the fourth quarter, Media Networks' performancedoubled, attendance was up at our parks and Consumer Products experienced growth in licensing.These and many other indicators underscore that The Walt Disney Company is poised to reap the rewards of astabilizing domestic and global economic environment.  We are pleased with the year just passed and eager topower forward into 2004.
Thomas O. StaggsOur September quarter demonstrated what the combination of creative excellence and consistent financial rigor cando for the bottom line.  Recent results also provide an early indication of how well positioned our businessesare to deliver growth going forward.Studio Entertainment proved to be our strongest year-over-year performer for the quarter, with segment operatingincome more than doubling versus 2002.Once again, DVD sales were an important contributor to growth, more than offsetting declines in VHS sales.  Forthe fourth quarter, titles like Chicago, and Bringing Down the House drove more than a 20% increase in global DVDunit sales.In fact, Disney's worldwide DVD sales for the full year grew by more than 40%, to roughly 175 million units,which more than offset the erosion in VHS unit sales.Of course, the continued success of our 2003 film slate also contributed greatly to our fourth quarter results,led by Pirates of the Caribbean and Finding Nemo.We've had solid results from our film slate for the last three years and that success was especially evident thisquarter in the TV distribution window where titles like Lilo and Stitch, Remember the Titans, Sweet Home Alabamaand Spy Kids 2  helped to double operating profit for this business versus Q4 of 2002.This improvement is an indication of how a successful theatrical year can yield profit enhancing revenue streamsfor years to come,  which bodes well for the future, given the great performance we've had at the box office in2003.Cable Networks was also a large contributor to our growth, where higher ratings, a strong advertising market andhigher affiliate revenues were all factors in cable's 15% profit increase versus the prior year.  The significant growthwe saw in Q4 also reflected lower NFL rights fee amortization at ESPN as a result of our moving into the finalthree years of that contract.
Cable Networks revenue growth for the year was offset somewhat due to our continued investment in new programmingprimarily for new series at ABC Family and for the NBA and Wimbledon at ESPN.Q4 advertising at the network was up 7% versus the prior year, with a little more than half the increase beingdriven by two additional NFL games during the quarter.  An increased number of original program episodes and thecosts of the two additional games more than offset these improvements.We continue to benefit from the strong and efficient management of our Television stations and our Radiooperations.  At our TV Stations, gross ad sales in Q4 were roughly flat with the prior year, however lowerexpenses yielded modest improvements in operating income.   More importantly, our Television stations are number1 in 7 of our 10 markets and enjoy margins averaging 40%.At our radio networks, Q4 gross ad sales increased by 7%.   At our owned radio station group, ad sales were up8%, driven by our larger markets - especially NY, LA and Chicago.   Our radio station group has also done a greatjob of translating top line performance into bottom line results.  Margins at our radio stations average over40% and, for the quarter, profits at the radio group increased by 19% over the prior year.In Consumer Products, increases in revenue across every licensing business -- hardlines, softlines, and toys -helped drive double-digit operating income growth in the merchandise licensing segment.   Increased earnedroyalties in North America, Japan and Asia from licensees like Kellogg's, Hallmark and Gillette contributed tothis performance as did new licenses and new products in our toy division.These results were partially offset by margin compression at the Disney Stores.At theme parks, we've emphasized that we anticipate a gradual improvement in trends which is consistent with whatwe saw this quarter.
At Walt Disney World, attendance grew by 12% for the September quarter.  New offerings like Mission: Space andsuccessful promotions like the 7 for 4 deal drove growth in the local and domestic tourist segments.International visitation to Walt Disney World was down just slightly for the quarter.The 7 for 4 promotion also helped drive  a 9% increase in occupied room nights at our Florida hotels and, notsurprisingly, a 5% decline in per room spending due to lower average daily rates.   Per capita spending on theparks side was off by roughly 4%.On the West Coast, attendance at the Disneyland Resort came in 5% ahead of the prior year quarter with increasesacross all our guest segments.   Per capita spending was flat with last year.  Occupied room nights improved by13% with per room spending increasing by 4%.These attendance and occupancy gains were offset by higher expenses for employee benefits and insurance andmarketing, as well as the absence of Euro Disney royalties.As expected, our 2003 capital spending for the company as a whole was roughly even with our spending in 2002 atslightly under $1.1 billion.  More than 50% of this investment was in our Parks and Resorts segment.  As we havepreviously indicated, we expect capital spending at our domestic theme parks to remain meaningfully under $1billion per year going forward.Throughout the last couple of years, we've responded to the difficult environment by driving operating,investment and cash flow efficiencies across our businesses and we intend to maintain that focus, even as thingsimprove.In fiscal 2003, we also continued to improve our balance sheet, while safeguarding our liquidity.  We generatedfree cash flow of just under $1.9 billion this year, up by more than 50% from 2002.  As a result, we reduced netborrowings by more than 10% to $11.5 billion.   Looking ahead, we continue to target credit statistics in the A-range and we will therefore seek to further improve the balance sheet during fiscal 2004.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments on our expectations for 2004.  As is true with a number of other largecompanies, we feel that in most instances it is better to avoid making specific earnings projections.This approach reflects the fact that our primary focus is on managing Disney for long term success andshareholder value and not against short-term forecasts.However, we do not want our position on this issue to be misconstrued as a lack of confidence in our ability todeliver strong growth.  For that reason, let me add that barring unforeseen changes in the climate for ourbusinesses, we expect to deliver fiscal 2004 earnings that meet or exceed the current Wall Street consensus of$0.84 per share.Here are some of the key growth drivers and swing factors that could impact our results as we move forward.Media Networks will likely lead the way for us in fiscal 2004, where the very successful upfront advertising salesover the summer, improved subscription revenues in cable and an improved cost structure at ABC should allcontribute to our bottom line.At the same time, our investment in programming will continue, especially at The Disney Channel and ESPN.Bob will give you some color on what we're seeing in the current ad market, but changes in the strength of thatmarket - as well as ABC ratings for the balance of the year - remain an important swing factor in 2004.In terms of current trends at our parks, the December quarter has started off relatively well with overallattendance at our domestic parks up 12%.   It's worth noting that international attendance remains relativelyflat versus last year.  At this point our room reservations on the books are up a more modest 8% versus thistime last year.Please note that our advance booking window remains relatively short, which makes reading this data difficult, soour actual results could easily vary from these trends.
Barring a meaningful change in the environment, we look for continued gradual improvement in attendance andoccupancy in 2004 offset by the increases in employee benefits costs that we've previously discussed.Our 2004 film slate is off to a solid start with Brother Bear.  Key upcoming releases for the year includeDisney's Haunted Mansion, which comes out next week, Cold Mountain from Miramax this winter, and three springreleases,  The Alamo, Hidalgo and our next animated film Home on the Range.The Studio will benefit as the '03 theatrical slate is released in home video this year.  So far in Q1, we'veseen tremendous success from the DVD releases of Lion King and Finding Nemo.With Pirates of the Caribbean, Freaky Friday and Santa Clause 2 also slated for a Q1 home video release, thestudio should have a very strong start in 2004.   As you might expect, year-over-year comparisons for the Studioafter Q1 will be more difficult.As we turn our sights towards delivering strong results in 2004 and beyond, our primary financial goals arestraightforward and unchanged.  We remain focused on: delivering long-term growth in our earnings and cash flow;wisely deploying our excess cash flow; and generating improved returns on our invested capital.Succeeding in these goals requires a disciplined approach to managing financial risk without sacrificing creativequality.  We believe that our most recent financial results reflect the progress that Disney has made toward thatend.Robert A. IgerMichael talked about our key areas of business focus that have positioned us for growth in the past, and which webelieve will continue to drive growth in the future.Nowhere is the importance - and successful application -- of these priorities more apparent than in our Cablesegment, where new networks and services are extending the reach of our popular brands, and where programminginvestment is extending the number and reach of key character franchises.
These efforts are also resulting in improved ratings across our cable assets, which deliver increased value forour company and for viewers and distributors alike.ESPN generates a significant part of cable television's value proposition for viewers, cable and satelliteoperators and advertisers.  On the ratings front, ESPN delivers more top rated programs than any other adsupported cable network.  In 2002, 18 of the top 20 rated shows on ad-supported cable were on ESPN and theSeptember quarter of 2003 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of year over year ratings gains at ESPN.ESPN is also recognized as a leading driver of technological innovations and new businesses.  By making thestrongest sports commitment to High Definition television in the U.S. today, ESPN is helping to drive the earlytransition to digital- a platform that provides meaningful revenue opportunities for MSOs.We have paying contracts for ESPN HD in place with the cable and satellite companies that control 70% of thenation's multi-channel video homes.  As our distribution partners roll out HDTV to customers, ESPN HD will be animportant part of that offering.ESPN is not the only area of opportunity in our Cable segment.  As television becomes a key driver of globalentertainment properties, the Disney Channel has evolved into a new engine of creative and franchise developmentfor our company.  Disney Channel continued its positive ratings trajectory this past quarter, finishing as the #1basic cable network in the important Kids 6-11 demographic in both primetime and total day.We're bolstering Disney Channel's foundation by investing in new cable networks around the world.  The launch ofDisney Channel Japan - which required an investment of $10 million this past quarter -- brings our InternationalDisney Channel count to 22.The launch of this new channel will require continued investment of roughly $25 million in 2004, however we'reconfident that it will broaden the global reach and value of both our cable assets and the Disney brand, anddeliver an attractive return on capital over time.
Ratings and quality programming have obviously been a principal focus at the ABC Network as well.  Since March2001, ABC has made great strides in developing strong comedies and has successfully added an unprecedented 10comedies to its primetime schedule.Eight of these ten are number one in their respective time periods in the coveted sales demographic of Adults 18 -49.These young comedies - all with upside potential - are the creative and financial building blocks for the futureof ABC primetime, especially those that are produced in-house by Touchstone Television.The last two seasons have been the most successful in Touchstone Television's 19-year history and this success isbeginning to flow over into our off-net syndication pipeline.Most recently, My Wife and Kids cleared more than 90% of the country in syndication, garnering well more than $2million an episode.   According to Jim - the No. 1 program Tuesday at  9pm -- is up next.  While this revenuestream won't be felt until fiscal 2005, the reception our ABC produced comedies are receiving bodes well forABC's off-net syndication business.ABC's work in primetime is still ongoing, but our performance season to date indicates things are headed in theright direction.  ABC now ranks first or second in 75% of the half-hours in primetime among regular programs forthe key sales demographic of Adults 18-49, ahead of its competition.Thanks to this performance momentum, ABC is able to take advantage of the scatter marketplace with pricing thatis out-pacing upfront levels.Since last quarter, we have seen some slowing in the ad marketplace, including spot TV and radio.  In radio,pacings appear to be weakening in Q1, although they are still ahead of prior year.  And at our TV stations, we expect tobe on par with last year even though political spending in this quarter is approximately $30 - $35 million less than last year.
At the studio, our key priority remains driving for higher returns on investment by making the right movie at theright price.Making the right movie often involves leveraging our Disney brand advantage and the strength of Disney franchisesto drive performance, as we did with Pirates of the Caribbean, and Freaky Friday and with next weekend's HauntedMansion starring Eddie Murphy.Combined, Buena Vista and Miramax have generated close to $2 billion in U.S. box office, representing the numberone position with over 26 percent market share so far for calendar year 2003.But box office is just the top line of the equation.  The economics of our 2003 live action film slate -- whichwe expect will deliver an ultimate return on investment above 20% - reflects our commitment to generatingattractive returns on the capital we invest.DVD also continues to represent an opportunity for growth of substantial magnitude for Disney, especially in2004.   We've seen strong early results from the DVD release of our most important platinum video title, The LionKing -- which has sold over 11 million units worldwide and from the record-setting release of Finding Nemo whichhas sold 20 million home video units in the U.S. alone, with sales still going strong.In Consumer Products, the restructuring of merchandise licensing has progressed nicely. Three years ago, westated a goal of signing deals with 20 of the world's top retailers.   We've exceeded that goal and have a totalof 23 direct-to-retail deals in place today and are beginning to see traction in this business as a result.The sale process for the Disney Stores is also on track and will likely extend into calendar 04.At the theme parks, where we have invested heavily in our resort assets, our strategy has shifted towardincreasing the utilization of these tremendous properties and improving our market share, and consequently ourreturns on our investment.
To do so, we are enhancing our marketing and distributing efforts and continuing to invest judiciously tomaintain the differentiation of our parks and resorts. Capital spending going forward falls into 4 categoriesthat support these goals.First, we'll continue to make differentiating, big statement investments like Mission: SPACE and Tower ofTerror.We'll balance these E-ticket rides with attractions that emphasize the Disney brand like Mickey's PhilharMagic atWalt Disney World.These will be complemented with live shows and spectaculars - such as Aladdin and Playhouse Disney in California-which require modest investment and drive both attendance and guest satisfaction.The final category includes smaller special effects which provide some of the biggest "wows" for our guests, likeour animatronic Lucky the Dinosaur, which takes our character meet & greets to the next technological level.Even though we have the capacity to continue driving returns on our existing properties, we expect a substantialpiece of our growth to come from international expansion.  Our resort in Hong Kong - on schedule to open infiscal year 2006 -- will be an important footprint for Disney, given its location in the world's most populouscountry, China.In addition to differentiating the physical infrastructure of our theme parks, we're launching targeted marketingefforts that offer great incentives to visit Disney, like Magical Gatherings, a new product that meets theemerging popularity of multi-household and inter-generational travel, and Disney's Golden Celebration, an18-month event that kicks off in May 2005 to commemorate the birth of our theme parks.These initiatives continue to lay the groundwork for us to reap the benefit of an economic recovery that we hopeto see continue.
This year in theme parks -- and across every segment of the company -- we've been particularly successfulexecuting on the three strategic priorities that Michael outlined up front:  building our portfolio of enduringcharacter franchises, fortifying the competitive advantage of our brands, and using technological innovation toenhance everything we do.We believe a continued focus on these three elements will yield success for Disney for years to come and willallow us to deliver long-term shareholder value in the form of increasing returns on capital, increased earningsand higher free cash flow.
