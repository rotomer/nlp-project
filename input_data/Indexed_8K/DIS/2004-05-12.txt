FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEMay 12, 2004                          THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS HIGHER RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED                                                            MARCH 31, 2004o        EPS for the second fiscal quarter grew 73% versus the prior year, led by segment operating income growth at the Media         Networks, Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products segments, partially offset by a decline at Studio Entertainmento        Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $2.5 billion, well more than double the prior-year period.         Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $2.0 billion compared to $481 million for the first half of the prior         year         BURBANK, Calif. - The Walt Disney Company today reported earnings for the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2004.         Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.26, up 73% from $0.15 in the prior-year second quarter.         For the six month period, diluted earnings per share were $0.59, which was an increase of $0.38 from the prior-year periodbefore the cumulative effect of an accounting change.  Earnings per share for the first quarter of the prior year included anapproximately $0.04 negative impact due to the write-off of an aircraft leveraged lease investment.
"Disney is benefiting from the unique strengths of the Company's assets as well as the long-term growth strategies we'veput in place as we are seeing solid growth in attendance at our theme parks from both domestic and international visitors, in globalsales of DVDs and in the financial results of our Media Networks businesses," said Michael Eisner, Disney chief executive officer."Disney's talented and experienced management team is committed to creating the best in quality family entertainment whilemaintaining an unwavering focus on increasing earnings, cash flow and returns on invested capital."         Revenues, segment operating income, income before the cumulative effect of accounting change, net income and dilutedearnings per share amounts for the quarter and six months are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):                                                Three Months Ended                            Six Months Ended                                                      March 31,                                   March 31,                                            ----------------------------               -----------------------------                                                2004(1)       2003(2)        Change        2004(1)       2003(2)         Change                                            -------------  -------------  -----------  -------------  --------------  -----------Revenues                                     $   7,189      $   6,500          11 %     $  15,738      $   13,670          15 %Segment operating income                         1,120            814          38 %         2,391      $    1,296          84 %Income before the cumulative  effect of accounting change                $     537      $     314          71 %     $   1,225      $      421         191 %Net income                                   $     537      $     314          71 %     $   1,225      $      350         250 %Diluted earnings per share  before the cumulative effect  of accounting change                       $    0.26      $    0.15          73 %     $    0.59      $     0.21         181 %Diluted earnings per share                   $    0.26      $    0.15          73 %     $    0.59      $     0.17         247 %   (1)   As discussed further below, the Company adopted FIN 46R and as a result, consolidated the balance sheets of Euro Disney and         Hong Kong Disneyland as of March 31, 2004.  FIN 46R requires that Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland's operating         results continue to be accounted for on the equity method for the three and six-month periods ended March 31, 2004.  The         Company will consolidate their income and cash flow statements beginning April 1, 2004, the beginning of the Company's         fiscal third quarter.   (2)   The Company adopted EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21) effective at the beginning         of fiscal 2003.  Accordingly, the prior-year second quarter and year-to-date results have been restated to reflect the         implementation of EITF 00-21.
Fiscal 2004 Outlook         Barring negative changes in the environment and given the strength of our recent results and the positive trends we areseeing in our businesses, we now believe that we will deliver growth in earnings for the full year of 50% or more excluding thepotential impact from items like the sale of the Disney Stores, versus the $0.65 reported last year.  We are also keeping an eye onthe exposure we have from airline lease investments made in the early nineties, which could impact our outlook as discussed morefully in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  We are also expecting to deliver double-digit average annual earnings growth from 2004through at least 2007.Operating ResultsStudio Entertainment         Studio Entertainment revenues increased 16% to $2.2 billion and segment operating income decreased 26% to $153 million. Thedecline in segment operating income for the quarter primarily reflected declines in worldwide theatrical motion picturedistribution, partially offset by increases in worldwide home entertainment. Current quarter theatrical results reflected higherfilm write-downs and higher marketing and distribution costs for films released after the quarter-end. In addition, resultsreflected the performance during the quarter of Cold Mountain, Hidalgo and Miracle, compared to the prior-year quarter whichincluded the stronger overall performance of Chicago, Bringing Down the House and Shanghai Knights. Increases in worldwide homeentertainment reflected higher DVD sales. The current quarter results included The Lion King 1, Finding Nemo, Pirates of theCaribbean and Brother Bear as compared to the prior-year quarter, which included Signs, Sweet Home Alabama and 101 Dalmatians II:Patch's London Adventure.
Media Networks         Media Networks revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $2.8 billion, and segment operating income increased 76% to $704million.  See Table A for further detail of Media Networks results.         Cable Networks contributed $171 million of the increase in segment operating income, primarily due to higher affiliaterevenue at ESPN.   Cable results also benefited from higher advertising revenues and the favorable impact of a bankruptcy settlementwith a cable operator in Latin America, partially offset by higher programming costs.  Higher affiliate revenue at ESPN was dueprimarily to contractual rate adjustments.         During the quarter, the Company reached a settlement with DirecTV Latin America, the Company's major distributor in thatregion, which had declared bankruptcy in fiscal 2003.  As a result of the settlement, the Company received payment for receivablesthat had been fully reserved in the second quarter of the prior year and prior period revenues that had not been previouslyrecognized.         Broadcasting contributed $133 million of the increase in segment operating income, primarily due to higher advertisingrates received in the upfront sales market and the absence of the Super Bowl in the current-year quarter, partially offset by theimpact of lower ratings at the ABC television network.
Parks and Resorts         Parks and Resorts revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $1.7 billion and segment operating income increased 21% to $188million.         The increase in revenue at Parks and Resorts reflected higher theme park attendance and hotel occupancy at the Walt DisneyWorld Resort. Higher visitation from both domestic and international tourists as well as residents reflected the continued successof Mission: SPACE, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Disney's Pop Century Resort and improvements in travel and tourism as well as theimpact of promotional programs offered during the quarter.         The revenue increases were partially offset by higher operating costs due primarily to higher volume-related and employeebenefit costs, and increased depreciation expense.  Increased depreciation was driven by investments in new resort properties andtheme park attractions including Disney's Pop Century Resort, Mission: SPACE and Mickey's PhilharMagic and information technologysystems.         Parks and Resorts results also reflected higher theme park attendance, hotel occupancy and guest spending at the DisneylandResort. Higher theme park attendance and hotel occupancy at the Disneyland Resort were driven by promotional programs offered duringthe quarter. These increases were more than offset by higher operating costs primarily due to fixed asset retirements and highervolume-related, marketing and employee benefits costs.         Higher employee benefits costs at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland reflected increased pension and post-retirementmedical costs, which grew by $34 million across the entire segment.  On a full year basis, we expect that these costs will increaseby approximately $137 million over the prior year.
Consumer Products         Revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $512 million and segment operating income increased 42% to $75 million.         Results for the quarter were driven by improvements at the Disney Store and at Publishing, partially offset by a decreaseat Buena Vista Games. The improvement at the Disney Store reflected decreased losses due to overhead savings and gross marginimprovements at continuing stores in North America as well as the impact of the closure of underperforming stores. Publishing growthreflected strong performance of Finding Nemo products and W.i.t.c.h. magazine sales in Europe. The decrease at Buena Vista Games wasdue to a contract termination payment received in the prior-year quarter. Licensing results for the quarter increased modestlyversus the prior-year quarter as the current quarter reflected strong sales of the Disney Princess line and continued strongperformance of direct-to-retail license agreements in Europe.Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses         Corporate and unallocated shared expenses decreased 12% to $82 million for the quarter.  The decrease for the quarterreflected adjustments to litigation reserves, partially offset by administrative cost increases.
Net Interest Expense         Net interest expense was as follows:                                                                                   Quarter Ended                                                                                     March 31,                                                                       ---------------------------------------(in millions)                                                               2004                   2003                                                                       ----------------       ----------------Interest expense                                                         $      (140)           $      (172)Interest and investment income (loss)                                             (7)                    (6)                                                                           ------------           ------------Net interest expense                                                     $      (147)           $      (178)                                                                           ============           ============         Interest expense decreased by 19% to $140 million primarily reflecting lower average debt balances.Equity in the Income of Investees         Income from equity investees, consisting primarily of Euro Disney, A&E Television, Lifetime Television and E! EntertainmentTelevision, increased 51% to $77 million for the quarter primarily due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue at Lifetime, A&E,E!, and the History Channel, partially offset by a decline at Euro Disney due to higher costs.         FIN 46 In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board amended FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation ofVariable Interest Entities (FIN 46) by issuing FIN 46R which generally deferred the effective date of FIN 46 to March 31, 2004. TheCompany adopted FIN 46R and, as a result, consolidated the balance sheets of Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland on March 31, 2004.See Table D for the condensed consolidating balance sheet of the Company, reflecting the impact of consolidating Euro Disney andHong Kong Disneyland as of March 31, 2004. Under FIN 46R, the operating results of Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland continue tobe accounted for on the equity method for the six-month period ended March 31, 2004. The Company will consolidate the income andcash flow statements of Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland beginning April 1, 2004.
The recognition of additional liabilities as a result of consolidating Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland does not resultin any incremental increase in the level of claims on the general assets of the Company and its other subsidiaries; rather, theadditional liabilities represent claims against the additional assets recognized by the Company as a result of the consolidations.Conversely, the additional assets recognized as a result of consolidating Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland do not representadditional assets of the Company that could be used to satisfy claims by the creditors of the Company and its other subsidiaries.

Excluding the impact of consolidating Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, net borrowings decreased from $11.5 billion atSeptember 30, 2003 to $9.8 billion at March 31, 2004 driven by strong free cash flow for the six months ended March 31, 2004.

See the discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics that follows below.         The increase in free cash flow for the six months as compared to the prior-year period was due primarily to higherearnings, lower film and television production spending and decreased funding to Euro Disney through its line of credit.         Investments in parks, resorts and other property were primarily for new rides and attractions at the theme parks andcompany-wide information technology projects.

Euro Disney         During November 2003, Euro Disney obtained waivers from its lenders, effective through March 31, 2004, with respect to debtcovenants for fiscal 2003. On March 22, 2004, Euro Disney obtained an extension of these waivers through May 31, 2004. The waiversare expected to give Euro Disney, its lenders and the Company time to find a resolution to Euro Disney's financial situation. Inconjunction with the extension, the Company agreed to replace its supplemental 45 million subordinated credit facility, whichexpired on March 31, 2004, with a 25 million ($31 million at March 31, 2004 exchange rates) subordinated credit facility, whichwill expire on May 31, 2004. Additionally, Euro Disney agreed not to allow the outstanding balance of its 168 million ($207 millionat March 31, 2004 exchange rates) line of credit with the Company to fall below 110 million during the extension period. As ofMarch 31, 2004, Euro Disney had borrowed 110 million ($136 million at March 31, 2004 exchange rates) on this credit line. This lineof credit is excluded from the Company's balance sheet as it is eliminated when consolidating Euro Disney. As of May 7, 2004, EuroDisney had not borrowed any amounts under the 25 million subordinated credit facility and the balance of the 168 million creditfacility was 125 million ($149 million at May 7, 2004 exchange rates).         Euro Disney is currently engaged in discussions with its lenders and the Company to obtain supplemental financing toaddress its cash requirements. Such financing may include an extension or change in the terms associated with the Company's creditline and/or additional commitments from the Company. If a resolution to Euro Disney's future financing needs is not obtained by May31, 2004 and assuming the waiver period is not extended again, the waivers would expire and Euro Disney's lenders could acceleratethe maturity of Euro Disney's debt. Should that occur, Euro Disney would be unable to meet all of its debt obligations. The Companybelieves that Euro Disney will ultimately obtain the requisite loan modifications and additional financing; however, there can be noassurance that this will be the case. Should Euro Disney be unable to obtain loan modifications and/or additionalfinancing, the assets of Euro Disney could become impaired, potentially resulting in corresponding charges in our consolidatedfinancial statements.
Non-GAAP Financial Metrics         This earnings release presents net borrowings, net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, free cashflow and aggregate segment operating income which are important financial metrics for the Company but are not GAAP-defined metrics.Net borrowings - The Company believes that net borrowings provide investors with useful information regarding our financialcondition. Net borrowings reflects the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we earn interest incomeon our cash balances that offsets a portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as ameasure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstandingindebtedness when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not immediately apply cash and cashequivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repaydebt in the ordinary course of business.Net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland - The Company uses net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland to evaluate claims on the general assets of the Company separate from the claims on the assets of Euro Disney and HongKong Disneyland.  The Company believes that this information is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate theeffects on our borrowings and cash and cash equivalents resulting from the adoption of FIN 46R.  In addition, it allows investorsto evaluate the claims on our general assets separate from the claims on the assets of the separate entities, and it gives investorsthe opportunity to evaluate the ability to satisfy debt obligations from the assets that actually back its obligations.         The following table reconciles net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland to total borrowings and netborrowings (in millions):                                                      Amounts excluding Euro                                                       Disney and Hong Kong      Euro Disney and Hong             Total                                                            Disneyland              Kong Disneyland               TWDC                                                      -----------------------  ------------------------- ---------------------Current portion of borrowings                         $        3,092           $          2,262          $          5,354Long-term borrowings                                           9,577                        384                     9,961                                                      -----------------------   ------------------------   -------------------Total borrowings                                              12,669                      2,646                    15,315Cash and cash equivalents                                     (2,874)                      (274)                   (3,148)                                                      -----------------------   ------------------------   -------------------Net borrowings                                        $        9,795           $          2,372          $         12,167                                                      =======================   ========================   ===================
Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash flow from operations less investments in parks, resorts and other property),among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capitalexpenditures.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to servicedebt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and pay dividends.Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operatingincome, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses separate fromnon-operating factors.  The Company believes that aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluatechanges in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect netincome, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results.         These measures should be used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures ofborrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Net borrowings, net borrowings excluding Euro Disney andHong Kong Disneyland, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable tosimilarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Management believes that recognition of additional liabilities as a result of consolidating Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland does not result in any incremental increase in the level of claims on the general assets of the Company and its othersubsidiaries; rather, they represent claims against the additional assets recognized by the Company as a result of theconsolidations. Conversely, we believe that additional assets recognized as a result of consolidating Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland do not represent additional assets of the Company that could be used to satisfy claims by the creditors of the Companyand its other subsidiaries.
