FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEAugust 10, 2004                 THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS HIGHER RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2004o        EPS for the third fiscal quarter grew 21% versus the prior year, led by segment operating income growth at the Media         Networks, Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products segments.         BURBANK, Calif. - The Walt Disney Company today reported earnings for the quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2004.         Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.29, up 21% from $0.24 in the prior-year third quarter. During thequarter, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling $56 million ($0.02 per share) in connection with theproposed sale of the Disney Stores in North America and the closure of certain other stores which is discussed further below.         For the nine month period, diluted earnings per share were $0.88, a $0.43 increase from the prior-year period earnings pershare of $0.45 before the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Earnings per share for the first quarter of the prior yearincluded an approximately $0.04 negative impact due to the write-off of an aircraft leveraged lease investment.         "The continued growth in our earnings this quarter, led by ESPN and our other cable networks, positions us well to delivermore than 50 percent growth in earnings for the year, as we predicted last quarter," said Disney CEO Michael Eisner. "Equallyimportant, our strong earnings and cash flow growth demonstrate the overall strength of our businesses. During the recent downturn,we have remained focused on managing the Company for long term performance and extending the Disney legacy and we believe that thepositive trends in our businesses validate that approach."

Under FIN 46R transition rules, Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland's operating results continued to be             accounted for on the equity method for the six month period ended March 31, 2004.         (2) The Company adopted EITF No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21) effective at the             beginning of fiscal 2003. Accordingly, the prior-year third quarter and year-to-date results have been restated to             reflect the implementation of EITF 00-21.
Operating ResultsParks and Resorts         Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 32% to $2.3 billion and segment operating income increased 20% to $421million. The consolidation of Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland contributed $332 million of the increase in revenue and $15million of the increase in segment operating income, with revenue from other Parks and Resorts operations growing $225 million (13%)and segment operating income from those operations growing $54 million (15%). See tables C, D, E, F and G for the impact ofconsolidating Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland.         Revenue and operating income growth was driven by higher attendance and occupancy at Walt Disney World.         Revenues increased by $557 million, of which $332 million was due to the consolidation of Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland. The remaining increase of $225 million is primarily due to higher theme park attendance and hotel occupancy at the WaltDisney World Resort. Higher visitation at Walt Disney World from both domestic and international tourists as well as Floridaresidents reflected the continued success of Mission: SPACE, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Disney's Pop Century Resort, improvements intravel and tourism and the impact of promotional programs offered during the quarter.         Costs and expenses increased $488 million, of which $317 million was due to the consolidation of Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland. The remaining increase of $171 million was driven by increases at Walt Disney World due primarily to higher operatinglabor and other volume related expenses, and increased costs associated with employee benefits, new product offerings, and marketingand sales initiatives.         At Disneyland Resort increased guest spending and attendance were offset by higher expenses. During the quarter Disneylandopened the "Twilight Zone: Tower of Terror" and announced its upcoming 50th Anniversary Celebration.Media Networks         Media Networks revenues for the quarter increased 8% to $2.9 billion and segment operating income increased 15% to $673million. See Table A for further detail of Media Networks results.         Segment operating income attributable to cable increased by $126 million, primarily due to higher affiliate and advertisingrevenue at ESPN, higher affiliate revenue at the domestic and international Disney Channels, and higher advertising revenue at ABCFamily. These increases were partially offset by higher programming costs at ESPN and the Disney Channel.         Higher affiliate revenue at ESPN was primarily due to contractual rate adjustments while increases at the Disney Channelwere primarily due to subscriber growth. The increase in advertising revenue at ABC Family was primarily due to increased ratings.         Segment operating income attributable to broadcasting decreased by $39 million, reflecting higher programming andproduction costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Increased advertising revenue reflected higher advertising ratespartially offset by ratings declines.Studio Entertainment         Studio Entertainment revenue for the quarter increased 19% to $1.7 billion and segment operating income decreased to $28million from $71 million in the prior-year quarter.         Segment operating income for the quarter was primarily driven by lower revenues and higher costs in domestic theatricalmotion picture distribution, partially offset by revenue and operating income increases in both television distribution and domestichome entertainment. Lower domestic theatrical motion picture distribution revenues reflected the weaker performance of currentquarter titles including Around the World in 80 Days, Raising Helen and The Alamo as compared to the prior-year quarter whichincluded Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo. Domestic theatrical cost increases reflected higher film write-downs and higher marketing anddistribution costs for films released after quarter-end. Television distribution revenues reflected higher pay television salesdriven by Freaky Friday, Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean. Domestic home entertainment revenue increases reflected higherDVD sales including Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Bad Santa, and Miracle.
Consumer Products         Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 9% to $541 million and segment operating income increased to $76million from $39 million in the prior-year quarter.         Higher segment operating income for the quarter was driven by decreased losses at the Disney Store due to cost reductionsand higher merchandise licensing revenues. Cost reductions at the Disney Store reflected overhead savings as well as the impact ofthe closure of underperforming stores. Higher merchandise licensing revenues reflected increases in toys and hardlines including theperformance of Power Rangers licenses in Europe.Restructuring and Impairment Charges         During the quarter, the Company's negotiations for the sale of the Disney Store chain in North America continued toprogress and on August 4, 2004, the Company and the prospective buyer signed a non-binding letter of intent to negotiate thepossible sale of the Disney Store chain in North America. Although there can be no assurance that a sale can be completed because anumber of issues remain open to negotiation and a number of conditions would need to be satisfied if an agreement is reached, theCompany currently believes it is likely that an agreement for the sale of the chain could be completed in the first quarter offiscal 2005. The transaction is expected to involve working capital and other adjustments at the time of the closing which weexpect, along with other transaction and restructuring costs, to result in charges that could range from $40 million to $50 million.         The Company has evaluated the carrying value of the fixed assets of the stores that may be sold in light of the expectedterms of the sale. As a result of this evaluation and the closure during the quarter of certain other stores, the Company recordedan impairment charge of $56 million in the quarter, which is reported in "Restructuring and impairment charges" in the condensedconsolidated statements of income.Net Interest Expense         Net interest expense was as follows (in millions):                                                                             Quarter Ended                                                                                June 30,                                                                  -------------------------------------                                                                      2004                   2003                                                                  --------------         --------------Interest expense                                                  $       (174)          $       (168)Interest and investment income (loss)                                       23                    (17)                                                                   -------------          -------------Net interest expense                                              $       (151)          $       (185)                                                                   =============          =============         Excluding an increase of $27 million due to the consolidation of Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, interest expensedecreased by $21 million (or 13%) primarily due to lower average debt balances.         Interest and investment income (loss) was income of $23 million in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $17 millionin the prior year period. The current quarter reflected higher interest income including interest income for Euro Disney and HongKong Disneyland, while the prior year period included a loss on the early repayment of certain borrowings.Equity in the Income of Investees         Income from equity investees increased 24% to $126 million for the quarter primarily due to improved performance atLifetime and E! due to higher advertising and affiliate revenue.

See the discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics that follows below.         The increase in free cash flow for the nine months as compared to the prior-year period was due primarily to increased netincome adjusted for non-cash impacts and lower film and television spending due in part to the timing of certain productions.         Investments in parks, resorts and other property were primarily for new rides and attractions at the theme parks and forcompany-wide information technology projects at corporate.

Non-GAAP Financial Metrics         This earnings release presents net borrowings, net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, free cashflow and aggregate segment operating income which are important financial metrics for the Company but are not GAAP-defined metrics.Net borrowings - The Company believes that net borrowings provide investors with useful information regarding our financialcondition. Net borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we earn interest incomeon our cash balances that offsets a portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as ameasure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstandingindebtedness when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not immediately apply cash and cashequivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repaydebt in the ordinary course of business.Net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland - The Company uses net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong KongDisneyland to evaluate claims on the general assets of the Company separate from the claims on the assets of Euro Disney and HongKong Disneyland. The Company believes that this information is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate theeffects on our borrowings and cash and cash equivalents resulting from the adoption of FIN 46R.         The following table reconciles net borrowings excluding Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland to total borrowings and netborrowings at June 30, 2004 (in millions):                                                  Amounts excluding Euro                                                   Disney and Hong Kong        Euro Disney and Hong                                                        Disneyland               Kong Disneyland               Total                                                 ------------------------    ----------------------    ------------------Current portion of borrowings                    $         3,007             $         2,209           $        5,216Long-term borrowings                                       8,900                         452                    9,352                                                 ------------------------    ----------------------    -------------------Total borrowings                                          11,907                       2,661                   14,568Cash and cash equivalents                                 (2,808)                       (215)                  (3,023)                                                 ------------------------    ----------------------    -------------------Net borrowings                                   $         9,099             $         2,446           $       11,545                                                 ========================    ======================    ===================Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash flow from operations less investments in parks, resorts and other property),among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capitalexpenditures. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to servicedebt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and pay dividends.Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operatingincome, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses separate fromnon-operating factors. The Company believes that aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluatechanges in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect netincome, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results.         These measures should be used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures ofborrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Net borrowings, net borrowings excluding Euro Disney andHong Kong Disneyland, free cash flow and aggregate segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable tosimilarly titled measures reported by other companies.
