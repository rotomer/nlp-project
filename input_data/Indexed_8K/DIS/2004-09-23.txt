Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.     (a)  Amendment to Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan     On September 19, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved an amendment of theRegistrant's Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan to reflect the Registrant's longstanding policy with respect to therepricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights.  The amendment added a new Section 4(e) to the Plan, reading in itsentirety as follows:    "(e) Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 8 of the Plan, without the prior approval ofDisney's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation,substitution or amendment of a stock option or stock appreciation right that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price orbase price of such an award previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such an award that would betreated as a `repricing' under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York StockExchange."     (b)  Management Incentive Bonus Program     On September 19, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved a redesignedManagement Incentive Bonus Program.  The new program, which will be implemented in the Registrant's 2005 fiscal year beginningOctober 1, 2004, will apply to all of the Registrant's bonus-eligible employees.     Under the program, 70% of the annual bonus compensation determination for the most senior corporate executives and 70% ofthe bonus pool determination for other corporate executives and managers will be based on performance against specific financialmeasures established at the outset of each fiscal year by the Compensation Committee. The remaining 30% will be based upon theCommittee's assessment of other individual and company-wide performance objectives and factors. The most senior corporateexecutives' bonuses will also be subject to further adjustment up or down by as much as 20%, depending upon how the Registrant'searnings per share (EPS) performance for the year compares to EPS performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of companiesover the same period. For executives and managers at the Registrant's business segments, 50% of the bonus pool determination willbe based on segment-level financial performance, 20% based on a combination of overall company financial and other performanceobjectives, and 30% based on performance against other segment-level goals.     Under the new program, the Compensation Committee will set specific target performance measures at the beginning of eachyear. These targets will be based upon a review of the annual operating plan of the company as a whole and any relevant businesssegment, considered in the context of prior years' results and other factors.
For fiscal year 2005, the overall company-level financial performance measures relevant to the bonus determination will betargeted levels of:     1. Operating income,     2. Earnings per share (EPS),     3. After-tax free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operations less investments in parks, resorts and other properties), and     4. Economic profit (defined as net operating profit after tax, minus a charge for capital employed in the business, based on        the cost of capital).For executive officers whose compensation is subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, bonuses intended to comply withSection 162(m)'s requirements will also continue to be subject to an additional financial performance test set pursuant to theRegistrant's 2002 Executive Performance Plan.     The following tables summarize the weighting of performance measures to be applied in the new program:- ---------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------- -----------------                                                                Performance Against Other                                    Overall Company-level       Corporate Objectives and                                     Financial Performance               Factors                   Total- ---------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------- -----------------Senior Corporate Executive Bonus              70%                          30%                      100%Determination  and Bonus PoolDetermination for otherCorporate Executives and Managers- ---------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------- -----------------     Segment-level financial performance measures will vary among the Registrant's lines of business because the drivers ofvalue differ by line of business.  Bonus pools for segment-level management will be determined principally by segment financialperformance, although they will also be tied to overall Registrant performance, as shown below:- ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------- --------------------- ---------------                                                                         Performance Against                                     Overall          Segment Level      Other Segment-level                                  Company-Level         Financial          Objectives and                                   Performance         Performance            Factors              Total- ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------- --------------------- ---------------Segment-level Bonus Pool               20%                 50%                  30%                100%Determination- ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------- --------------------- ---------------     Evaluating performance against other corporate-wide and segment-level objectives provides the Registrant with the abilityto set goals and reward managers and executives for performance beyond purely financial measures, including, for example,exceptional leadership, creativity, collaboration, diversity initiatives, crisis management and other activities that are criticalto driving long-term value for the shareholders of the Registrant.
In setting individual target bonuses for the most senior corporate executives and bonus pool levels for all other bonuseligible employees at the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including (but not limitedto) a review of peer group compensation both within the entertainment industry and more broadly and the level of growth reflected inthe Registrant's annual operating plan.     The Compensation Committee will also have discretion as to whether annual bonuses for the Registrant's most seniorcorporate executive officers will be paid in cash, restricted stock, restricted stock units or a combination.  The Committee willalso retain discretion, in appropriate circumstances, to grant a lower bonus or no bonus at all.     The Registrant will implement the redesigned program over the coming months, and reserves the right to make adjustments toprogram components as it deems appropriate to ensure that the program appropriately serves the objectives for which it wasdesigned.
