Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
     The Registrant holds an investment in aircraft leveraged leases with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) with a book value of $101 million. On September 14, 2005, Delta announced that it had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On September 19, 2005, the Registrant determined that its investment in its aircraft leveraged leases with Delta was fully impaired as a result of the bankruptcy filing and that it would take an after-tax charge of $68 million with respect to the impairment. No amount of this impairment represents a cash expenditure, however, in the event of a material modification to the leases or foreclosure of the aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments of up to approximately $100 million could be accelerated. The expected tax payments are currently reflected on our balance sheet as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Dated: September 23, 2005
