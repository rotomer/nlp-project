Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
The Registrant announced today that it intends to begin expensing employee stock options pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS 123R),
Share-Based Payment
under the modified retrospective method effective with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Under the modified retrospective method, the full year results for 2005 will be reported as though stock options had been expensed starting with the beginning of fiscal 2005. The application of the modified retrospective method does not affect the financial statements for fiscal years prior to 2005. The Registrant currently estimates that after-tax stock option expense for fiscal 2005 will approximate $0.08 per share of which approximately $0.02 relates to the fiscal fourth quarter. The Registrant will also record a deferred tax asset related to the fiscal 2005 income tax benefit.
 
Table A below shows estimated stock option expense by segment for fiscal 2005. Table B below shows the detail by fiscal quarter and segment of the annual stock option expense for fiscal 2004 previously disclosed in our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004. Both Table A and Table B exclude restricted stock expense which had been recorded in our historical consolidated financial statements.
