Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     The Registrant announced today that beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 it will report the performance of its operating segments including equity in the income of investees to align with how management will report and measure segment performance for internal management purposes. Previously, equity in the income of investees was reported as a reconciling item between segment operating income and income before income taxes, minority interests and the cumulative effect of accounting changes.
     The following tables reconcile segment operating income for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 under the historical reporting method to segment operating income as it will be reported when equity in the income of investees is included in segment operating income starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Table 1  plus Table 2  , equals Table 3  .

     The following presents the tables included in the section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005 (2005 Annual Report) revised to reflect how they will be reported when equity in the income of investees is included in segment operating income. This presentation also corrects a transposition of two digits in the section relating to fiscal year 2005 Media Networks advertising revenue, which was originally reported in this table in the Company's 2005 Annual Report as $7,721. This transposition did not affect any other financial information included in the Company's 2005 Annual Report.
