Last December, the Board of Directors requested that Senator Mitchell postpone his planned retirement at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and stand for re-election to facilitate an orderly chairman succession process. With the selection of his successor as Chairman now in place, Senator Mitchell will step down as Chairman and retire from the Board on December 31, 2006.

As Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble, he helped lead the company's business in developing markets, particularly Eastern and Central Europe and China. From 2004 to 2006 he was vice president for Finance and Administration at Yale University. Mr. Pepper currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.
Mr. Pepper began his career with Procter & Gamble in 1963, was named general manager of Procter & Gamble Italia in 1974 and promoted to group vice president in 1980. In 1984, Mr. Pepper was elected to the company's board of directors and in 1986 was named president. He served as Successor Trustee of the Yale Corporation from 1995 to 2003, which included election by his peers to the post of senior fellow for his last 2 years.
