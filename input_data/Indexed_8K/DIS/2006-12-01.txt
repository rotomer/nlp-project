A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

60 days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 5(c), Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation.
A Consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery to the Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a Consent, the Secretary of the Corporation shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consent and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the Consents and of the validity of the action to be taken by stockholder consent as he deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the Consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board of Directors, to serve as inspectors with respect to such Consent and such inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary of the Corporation under this Section 5(c). If after such investigation the Secretary or the inspectors (as the case may be) shall determine that the Consent is valid and that the action therein specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders, and the Consent shall be filed in such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 5(c), the Secretary or the inspectors (as the case may be) may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.

Exhibit 10.2
 
The purposes of the Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") are to provide long-term incentives and rewards to employees of The Walt Disney Company ("Disney") and its Affiliates (as defined below), to assist Disney in attracting and retaining employees with experience and/or ability on a basis competitive with industry practices and to associate the interests of such employees with those of Disney's stockholders. The Plan permits Disney to make awards in shares of The Walt Disney Company Common Stock (the "Common Stock").
 
The Plan, as amended and restated as provided herein, is effective as of November 28, 2006.
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Disney (the "Board") or by such other committee or committees of the Board as may be designated by the Board (the Compensation Committee or any other such committee being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "Committee"). The Compensation Committee shall be so constituted and empowered as to permit awards granted under the Plan to comply with the "non-employee director" requirements under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and with the "outside director" requirement of Section 162(m) of the Code. Members of any committee acting as the Committee hereunder shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.
The Committee shall have all the powers vested in it by the terms of the Plan, such powers to include exclusive authority (within the limitations described herein) to select the employees to be granted awards under the Plan, to determine the series and/or class of stock in respect of which any awards will be granted, to determine the type, size and terms of awards to be made to each employee selected, to determine the time when awards will be granted, when they will vest, when they may be exercised and when they will be paid, to amend awards previously granted and to establish objectives and conditions, if any, for earning awards and whether awards will be paid after the end of the award period. The Committee shall have full power and authority to administer and interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations, agreements, guidelines and instruments for the administration of the Plan and for the conduct of its business as the Committee deems necessary or advisable and to interpret same. The Committee's interpretation of the Plan, and all actions taken and determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder, shall be conclusive and binding
on all parties concerned, including Disney, its Affiliates, stockholders, any participants in the Plan and any other employee of Disney or any of its Affiliates.
All employees of Disney and all employees of Disney's Affiliates shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall from time to time designate from among those eligible to participate those employees who are to receive awards under and thereby become participants in the Plan. For purposes of the Plan, "Affiliate" shall mean any entity, as may from time to time be designated by the Committee, that is a subsidiary corporation of Disney (within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code), and each other entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with Disney. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the power to direct the management and policies of such entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meaning correlative to the foregoing.
 
(a) TYPES. Awards under the Plan shall be made with reference to shares of Common Stock and may include, but need not be limited to, stock options (including nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Code), stock appreciation rights (including free-standing, tandem and limited stock appreciation rights), warrants, dividend equivalents, stock awards, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance shares or other securities or rights that the Committee determines to be consistent with the objectives and limitations of the Plan. The Committee may provide for the issuance of shares of Common Stock as a stock award for no consideration other than services rendered or, to the extent permitted by applicable state law, to be rendered. In the event of an award under which shares of Common Stock are or may in the future be issued for any other type of consideration, the amount of such consideration shall be equal or greater than the amount (such as the par value of such shares) required to be received by Disney in order to assure compliance with applicable state law. The Committee may make any other type of award which it shall determine is consistent with the objectives and limitations of the Plan.
(b) PERFORMANCE GOALS. The Committee may, but need not, establish performance goals to be achieved within such performance periods as may be selected by it in its sole discretion, using such measures of the performance of Disney and/or any one or more of its Affiliates as it may select, for purposes of the granting, vesting, payment or other entitlement to awards under the Plan.
(c) RULES AND POLICIES. The Committee may adopt from time to time written rules and policies implementing the Plan. Such rules and policies may include, but need not be limited to, the type, size and term of awards to be made to participants and the conditions for the exercise or payment of such awards. Rules relating to stock options and free-standing and tandem stock appreciation rights (as distinguished from all other awards, including, without limitation, warrants), attached hereto as Appendix A, have been approved by the Committee. The rules set forth in Appendix A may be amended by the Committee in accordance with the provisions and subject to the
 
limitations set forth in Section 10 of the Plan. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the extent to which rules and policies that it may adopt in the future shall be subject to the approval of the Disney stockholders and/or limitations on the Committee's authority to amend such rules or policies.
(d) MAXIMUM AWARDS. A participant may be granted multiple awards under the Plan. The maximum numbers of shares of Common Stock subject to awards of stock options, warrants and stock appreciation rights under the Plan that may be granted during any period of five consecutive calendar years to any one individual shall be limited to 30,000,000 shares, determined both individually with respect to each such type of award and in the aggregate with respect to all such types of awards. With respect to awards of stock, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance shares or other forms of award conveying a similar economic benefit (but excluding stock options, warrants and stock appreciation rights): (i) the maximum numbers of shares of Common Stock that may be awarded during any period of five consecutive calendar years to any one individual shall be 6,000,000 shares, and (ii) the maximum numbers of shares of Common Stock that may be granted under such awards to all participants under the Plan shall be 30,967,650 shares, determined both individually with respect to each such type of award and in the aggregate with respect to all such types of awards.
(e) Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 8 of the Plan, without the prior approval of Disney's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a stock option or stock appreciation right that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price or base price of such an award previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such an award that would be treated as a repricing' under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York Stock Exchange.
 
The shares of Common Stock that may be delivered or purchased or used for reference purposes under the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of 300,283,369 shares. Shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or shares held in the Disney's treasury. Any shares subject to an award which for any reason expires or is terminated unexercised or unpaid as to such shares shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.
 
The Committee shall determine the extent to which awards shall be payable in cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination thereof or in any other form. The Committee may determine that all or a portion of a payment to a participant under the Plan, whether it is to be made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof or any other form, shall be deferred. Deferrals shall be for such periods and upon such terms, conditions and/or limitations as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion.
 
The Committee may determine that all or a portion of a payment to a participant under the Plan, whether it is to be made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof or any other form, or the right of a participant to exercise an award under the Plan, shall be vested at such times and upon such terms as may be selected by it in its sole discretion.
 
In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization, combination or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent it considers equitable to participants and consistent with the terms of the Plan, make adjustments in the number, kind or character of shares that may be subject to existing or future awards under the Plan (including by substitution of shares of another corporation including, without limitation, any successor of Disney), adjustments in the exercise, purchase or base price of an outstanding award and adjustments in the maximum numbers of shares referred to in Section 4 or Section 5 of the Plan. All such adjustments shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
 
(a) RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. A participant under the Plan shall have no rights as a holder of Common Stock with respect to awards hereunder, unless and until certificates for shares of such stock are issued to the participant, or the shares are issued to the participant by electronic account entry or such other means approved by the Committee, together with any legends or restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee for compliance with the terms of the Plan and applicable law.
(b) ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER. No award under this Plan shall be transferable by the participant or shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge (other than by or to Disney), except (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution (with all references herein to the rights or duties of holders or participants to be deemed to include the beneficiaries or legal representatives of the holder or participant unless the context otherwise expressly requires); or (ii) subject to the prior approval of the Committee, for transfers to "family members" (as defined below), charitable institutions or such other persons or entities approved by the Committee (subject to such limitations as the Committee in its discretion may impose, if necessary, to comply with applicable securities laws), in each case subject to the condition that the Committee be satisfied that such transfer is being made by the participant for estate planning, tax planning or donative purposes and no consideration (other than nominal consideration or interests in a family partnership, family corporation or other family-related entity) is received by the participant therefor. Except as provided above, during the lifetime of a participant, awards hereunder are exercisable only by, and payable only to, the participant.
 
For purposes hereof, a "family member" shall mean any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the participant's household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests.
(c) AGREEMENTS. All awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by agreements in such form and containing such terms and conditions (not inconsistent with the Plan) as the Committee shall adopt.
(d) COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REGULATIONS. During the term of the Plan and the term of any awards granted under the Plan, Disney will at all times reserve and keep available such number of shares as may be issuable under the Plan, and will seek to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, any requisite authority required in the opinion of counsel for Disney in order to grant shares of Common Stock, or options to purchase such stock or other awards hereunder, and transfer, issue or sell such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of any options or other awards. If in the opinion of counsel for Disney the transfer, issue or sale of any shares of its stock under the Plan shall not be lawful for any reason, including the inability of Disney to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction authority deemed by such counsel to be necessary to such transfer, issuance or sale, Disney shall not be obligated to transfer, issue or sell any such shares. In any event, Disney shall not be obligated to transfer, issue or sell any shares to any participant unless a registration statement which complies with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), is in effect at the time with respect to such shares or other appropriate action has been taken under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, or Disney receives evidence satisfactory to the Committee that the transfer, issuance or sale of such shares, in the absence of an effective registration statement or other appropriate action, would not constitute a violation of the terms and provisions of the Securities Act. Disney's obligation to issue shares upon the exercise of any award granted under the Plan shall in any case be subject to Disney being satisfied that the shares purchased are being purchased for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof, if at the time of such exercise a resale of such shares would otherwise violate the Securities Act in the absence of an effective registration statement relating to such shares.
(e) WITHHOLDING TAXES. Disney shall have the right to deduct from all awards hereunder paid in cash any federal, state, local or foreign taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such awards and, with respect to awards paid in Common Stock, to require the payment (through withholding from the participant's salary or otherwise) of any such taxes. The obligation of Disney to make delivery of awards in cash or Common Stock shall be subject to currency or other restrictions imposed by any government.
 
(f) NO RIGHTS TO AWARD. No employee or other person shall have any right to be granted an award under the Plan. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any participant any right to be retained in the employ of Disney or any of its Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Disney or any of its Affiliates, which are hereby reserved, to discharge the employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause.
(g) COSTS AND EXPENSES. The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by Disney and not charged to any award or to any participant receiving an award.
(h) FUNDING OF PLAN. The Plan shall be unfunded. Disney shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any award under the Plan.
 
(a) AMENDMENTS. The Committee may at any time terminate or from time to time amend the Plan in whole or in part, but no such action shall adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to any awards theretofore made under the Plan.
Unless the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock present, or represented, and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall have first approved thereof, no amendment of the Plan shall be effective which would (i) increase the maximum numbers of shares referred to in Section 5 of the Plan or the maximum awards that may be granted pursuant to Section 4(d) of the Plan to any one individual or (ii) extend the maximum period during which awards may be granted under the Plan.
With the consent of the participant, if adversely affected, the Committee may amend outstanding agreements evidencing awards under the Plan in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.
(b) TERMINATION. Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been terminated as above provided, the Plan (but not the awards theretofore granted under the Plan) shall terminate on and no awards shall be granted after March 6, 2011.
 
(a) ACCELERATED VESTING. Except to the extent an award agreement provides for a different result (in which case the award agreement will govern and this Section 11 of the Plan shall not be applicable), and except as may be limited by the provisions of Section 11(c) hereof, notwithstanding anything elsewhere in the Plan or any rules adopted by the Committee pursuant to the Plan to the contrary, if a Triggering Event shall occur within the 12-month period beginning with a Change in Control of Disney, then, effective immediately prior to such Triggering Event, (i) each outstanding stock option, warrant and stock appreciation right, to the extent that it shall not otherwise have become vested and exercisable, shall automatically become immediately and fully vested
 
and exercisable, (ii) each outstanding award of restricted stock shall become immediately and fully vested and all transfer restrictions under the terms of the award shall lapse and (iii) each outstanding award of phantom stock, performance shares or similar award shall become immediately and fully vested, all performance or other conditions related to the payment of or rights under the award shall lapse, and the award shall be immediately paid in the form specified in the award agreement.
(b) DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section 11, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below.
(1) CHANGE IN CONTROL. For purposes hereof, a "Change in Control" of Disney shall mean:
(i) the occurrence of (A) an acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a percentage of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Disney entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Disney Voting Securities") but excluding (1) any acquisition directly from Disney (other than an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege of a security that was not acquired directly from Disney), (2) any acquisition by Disney or an Affiliate, and (3) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by Disney or any Affiliate) (an "Acquisition") that is thirty percent (30%) or more of the Disney Voting Securities; and (B) the termination of employment, within six (6) months following the Acquisition, of the individual who is the Chief Executive Officer of Disney immediately prior to the Acquisition, for any reason other than death, permanent and total disability, Cause, or voluntary resignation (but excluding any termination for "good reason" under any employment agreement and any resignation that was requested by the Board or any such Person (or its employees or representatives) that completes an Acquisition);
(ii) at any time during a period of two (2) consecutive years or less, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board (and any new directors whose election by the Board or nomination for election by Disney's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was so approved) cease for any reason (except for death, disability or voluntary retirement) to constitute a majority thereof;
(iii) an Acquisition that is fifty percent (50%) or more of the Disney Voting Securities;
(iv) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar corporate transaction, whether or not Disney is the surviving company in such transaction, other than a merger, consolidation, or reorganization that would result in the Persons who are beneficial owners of the Disney Voting Securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to beneficially own, directly or
 
indirectly, in substantially the same proportions, at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Disney Voting Securities (or the voting securities of the surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization;
(v) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Disney;
(vi) the approval by the stockholders of Disney of a complete liquidation or dissolution of Disney; or
(vii) the occurrence of any transaction or event, or series of transactions or events, designated by the Board in a duly adopted resolution as representing a change in the effective control of the business and affairs of Disney, effective as of the date specified in any such resolution.
(2) TRIGGERING EVENT. For purposes hereof, the term "Triggering Event" shall mean (i) the termination of employment of a participant by Disney or an Affiliate (or any successor thereof) other than on account of death, permanent and total disability or Cause, (ii) the occurrence of a Constructive Termination or (iii) any failure by Disney (or a successor entity) to assume, replace, convert or otherwise continue any award in connection with the Change in Control (or another corporate transaction or other change effecting the Common Stock) on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to such transaction, except for equitable adjustments to reflect the changes in the Common Stock pursuant to Section 8 hereof.
(3) CAUSE. For purposes hereof, the term "Cause" shall mean a determination by the Committee that a participant (i) has been convicted of, or entered a plea of NOLO CONTENDERE to a crime that constitutes a felony under federal or state law, (ii) has engaged in willful gross misconduct in the performance of his or her duties to Disney or an Affiliate or (iii) has committed a material breach of any written agreement with Disney or any Affiliate with respect to confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation or similar restrictive covenant. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11(a) hereof, in the event that a participant is a party to an employment agreement with Disney or any Affiliate that defines a termination on account of "Cause" (or a term having similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of a termination on account of "Cause" for purposes hereof, but only to the extent that such definition provides the participant with greater rights. A termination on account of Cause shall be communicated by written notice to the participant, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the participant.
(4) CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION. For purposes hereof, the term "Constructive Termination" shall mean a termination of employment by a participant within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of any one or more of the following events without the participant's written consent (i) any reduction in position, title (for Vice Presidents or above), overall responsibilities, level of authority, level of reporting (for Vice Presidents or above), base compensation, annual incentive
 
compensation opportunity, aggregate employee benefits, or a request that the participant's location of employment be relocated by more than fifty (50) miles. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11(a) hereof, in the event that a participant is a party to an employment agreement with Disney or any Affiliate (or a successor entity) that defines a termination on account of "Constructive Termination", "Good Reason", "Breach of Agreement" (or a term having a similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of "Constructive Termination" for purposes hereof in lieu of the foregoing, but only to the extent that such definition provides the participant with greater rights. A Constructive Termination shall be communicated by written notice to the Committee, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the Committee, unless the circumstances giving rise to the Constructive Termination are cured within five (5) days of such notice.
(c) EXCISE TAX LIMIT. In the event that the vesting of the awards together with all other payments and the value of any benefit received or to be received by the participant would result in all or a portion of such payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the participant's payment shall be either (A) the full payment or (B) such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable Federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the participant, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of the payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the payment may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. All determinations required to be made under this Section 11 shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers or any other nationally recognized accounting firm which is Disney's outside auditor immediately prior to the event triggering the payments that are subject to the Excise Tax (the "Accounting Firm"). Disney shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide detailed supporting calculations of its determinations to Disney and participant. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Disney. The Accounting Firm's determinations must be made with substantial authority (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code). With respect to awards outstanding on June 26, 2000, for the purposes of all calculations under Section 280G of the Code and the application of this Section 11, all determinations as to present value shall be made using 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code) compounded semiannually, as in effect on June 26, 2000.
 
In the event of the death of a participant while employed by Disney or any of its Affiliates, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an award agreement, an outstanding award may be exercised by or shall become payable to the participant's beneficiary designated by the participant in the manner prescribed by the Committee or, in the absence of an authorized beneficiary designation, by the a legatee or legatees of such award under the participant's last will, or by such participant's executors, personal representatives or distributees of such award in accordance with the participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution (a "Beneficiary"). In the case of stock options, except as otherwise provided in a stock option agreement, any outstanding stock options
 
of a participant who dies while in employed by Disney or any of its Affiliates may be exercised by such Beneficiary in respect of all or any part of the total number of shares subject to such stock options at the time of such participant's death (whether or not, at the time of death, the deceased participant would have been entitled to exercise such stock options to the extent of all or any of the shares covered thereby). However, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in a stock option agreement, in the event of the death of the participant after the date of termination of employment with Disney or any of its Affiliates while a stock option remains outstanding, then such deceased participant's stock options shall expire in accordance with their terms at the same time they would have expired if such participant had not died, and may be exercised prior to their expiration by a Beneficiary in respect to the same number of shares, in the same manner and to the same extent as if such participant were then living. In the case of awards other than stock options, except as otherwise provided in an award agreement, any outstanding awards of a participant who dies while employed by Disney or any of its Affiliates shall become fully vested and, in the case of stock appreciation rights, exercisable as provided above with respect to stock options, and in the case of all other types of awards payable to the Beneficiary promptly following the participant's death.
 
To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and all awards hereunder comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and all award agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any provision of the Plan or an award agreement is determined by the Committee to not comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such changes to the Plan or an award agreement as the Committee deems necessary to comply with such requirements, provided that no such action shall adversely affect any outstanding award without the consent of the affected participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere in the Plan or an award agreement to the contrary, if a participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code at the time of termination of service with respect to an award, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of any payments or benefits under the award shall be deferred until the date that is six months following the participant's termination of service (or such other period as required to comply with Section 409A).
 
The validity and construction of the Plan and any agreements entered into thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
Pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Committee herein sets forth rules under which stock options and stock appreciation rights with respect to Common Stock may be granted to eligible participants of Disney or its Affiliates under the Plan. All such grants are subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan. Defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.
 
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may from time to time, in its sole discretion, award to participants in the Plan stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock. In connection therewith, the Committee shall have full and final authority, , in its discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan, (a) to determine the participants to whom options are to be awarded, (b) in the case of each option awarded, to determine whether the same shall be an incentive stock option pursuant to Section 422 of the Code (an "incentive stock option"), or an option which does not qualify under such Section 422 (a "non-qualified option"), (c) to determine the number of shares subject to each option, (d) to determine the time or times at which options will be awarded and will expire, (e) to determine the option price of the shares subject to each option, which price shall not be less than the minimum specified in Section 2 hereof, (f) to determine the time or times when each option vests and when it becomes exercisable and to determine the duration of the exercise period and limits on exercise and vesting, (g) to prescribe the form or forms of the instruments evidencing any options awarded under the Plan (the "Stock Option Agreement"), (h) to prescribe the manner in which, and the form of consideration for which, the option price should be paid and (i) to make any and all adjustments and/or conversions contemplated by the Plan.
inter alia
 
The option price shall be determined by the Committee at the time any option is awarded and shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date on which the option is granted. Subject to any limitations that may be imposed by the Committee to comply with any applicable rule, regulation or guideline or to accomplish any other objective, the option price shall be paid in cash (whether or not such cash is loaned by Disney to the participant for such purpose) or by the surrender, at the fair market value on the date on which the option is exercised, of shares of Common Stock, or by any combination of cash and such shares.
 
The purchase price for shares being purchased upon exercise of non-qualified options may also be paid in any other manner approved by the Committee, including, without limitation, by delivery to Disney of (a) a cash amount which shall not be less than the par value of the Common Stock multiplied by the number of shares being purchased and (b) a binding, joint and several obligation of the participant and a financial institution or broker approved by the Committee, to pay the balance of the purchase price upon such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time by the Committee. For purposes of this Appendix A, the "fair market value" of a share of Common Stock shall be the average of the highest and lowest of the New York Stock Exchange composite tape market prices at which the shares of Common Stock shall have been sold regular way on the date as of which fair market value is to be determined or, if there shall be no such sale on such date, the next preceding day on which such a sale shall have occurred.
 
Subject to earlier termination as provided in Section 4 hereof, an option granted under the Plan shall expire ten years after the date the option is granted, unless otherwise provided by the Committee. The Committee shall specify at the time each option is granted, and shall state in the Stock Option Agreement, the time or times at which, and in what proportions, that option becomes vested and may be exercised prior to its expiration or earlier termination, provided that, except as provided in Section 4 hereof, the participant is employed by Disney or an Affiliate on each such vesting date or on a date no more than three months prior to such vesting date. The Committee shall also determine at the time each option is granted, and shall state in the Stock Option Agreement, whether that option is to be treated as an incentive stock option.
 
Except as provided in this Section 4, Sections 3, 5 or 10 hereof or as otherwise may be provided by the Committee, no option may be exercised at any time unless the participant is then employed by Disney or one of its Affiliates.
The option of any participant whose employment with Disney or one of its Affiliates is terminated for any reason shall terminate on the earlier of (a) the date that the option expires in accordance with its terms (including any terms required under Section 422 of the Code if the option is an incentive stock option) or (b) termination of employment or the expiration of such period after termination of employment as the Committee shall specify in the Stock Option Agreement, provided that such period shall not be less than: (i) twelve months if employment ceased due to permanent and total disability, (ii) eighteen months if employment ceased at a time when the optionee is eligible to elect immediate commencement of retirement benefits under a pension plan to which Disney or any of its Affiliates had made contributions, (iii) eighteen months if the participant died while employed by Disney or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) three months if employment ceased for any other reason, except termination for cause (as described below). During such period as described above, except as otherwise specified in the Stock Option Agreement or in the event employment was terminated by the death of the
 
participant, the option may be exercised by such participant in respect of the same number of shares, in the same manner, and to the same extent as if he had continued as an employee during the first three months of such period; but no additional rights shall vest after such three months. The Committee shall have authority to determine in each case whether an authorized leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of employment for purposes hereof, as well as the effect of a leave of absence on the vesting and exercisability of an option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event of termination of employment or discharge of a participant "for cause", as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (the basis for which may, but need not be, specified in the Stock Option Agreement), then, subject to the terms of the Stock Option Agreement, any option or options held by such participant under the Plan, not theretofore exercised, shall terminate immediately upon such termination or discharge and may not be exercised thereafter. The Committee may authorize any officer or officers of Disney or its Affiliates to have standing authority to suspend the exercise of options by any participant with respect to whom grounds for a "for cause" termination may exist, as determined in the sole discretion of such officer or officers. Any such duly authorized officer may suspend the ability of any such participant to exercise an option pending the final determination of the Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
The Committee may accelerate vesting and exercisability or waive exercisability or vesting conditions of an option, and may extend the period of exercise of an option following termination of employment (subject to its maximum term), in any circumstances as it deems appropriate.
For purposes hereof, the Committee shall have the sole power to make all determinations regarding the termination of any participant's employment, including, but not limited to, the effective time thereof for the purposes of this Plan, the cause(s) therefor and the consequences thereof. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if an entity ceases to be an Affiliate of Disney or otherwise ceases to be qualified under the Plan or if all or substantially all of the assets of an Affiliate of Disney are conveyed (other than by encumbrance), such cessation or action, as the case may be, shall be deemed for purposes hereof to be a termination of the employment of each employee of that entity.
 
Any option granted under the Plan may be exercised by the participant, by the participant's Beneficiary in accordance with Section 12 of the Plan or such other persons as may be approved by the Committee by delivering to Disney at its main office (attention of its Secretary or such other individual or department as may be provided by Disney from time to time) written notice of the number of shares with respect to which the option is being exercised accompanied by full payment to Disney of the purchase price of the shares being purchased (in accordance with Section 2 hereof) and satisfaction of all applicable tax withholdings (in accordance with Section 9(e) of the Plan).
 
(a) AWARD OF ISOS. Incentive stock options may be granted only to those persons who are employees of Disney or any subsidiary corporation or parent corporation of Disney, within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an incentive stock option shall not be granted to any such person if immediately after such grant he is the owner or would be deemed in accordance with Section 424 of the Code to be the owner of more than 10% of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of Disney or any of its subsidiary or parent corporations.
(b) ANNUAL LIMITS. No incentive stock option shall be granted to a participant if as a result of which the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date of grant) of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time in any calendar year under the Plan, and any other stock option plans of Disney or any subsidiary or any parent corporation, would exceed $100,000, determined in accordance with Section 422 of the Code. This limitation shall be applied by taking options into account in the order in which granted.
(c) TERMS AND CONDITIONS; NONTRANSFERABILITY. Any incentive stock option granted under the Plan shall contain such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as are deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee. Such terms, together with the terms of this Plan, shall be intended and interpreted to cause such incentive stock option to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. Such terms shall include a term of exercise of the option which is not greater than ten years from the date of grant, and additional limitations on the period of exercise of the option following termination of employment. An incentive stock option shall by its terms be nontransferable otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable, during the lifetime of a participant, only by such participant.
(d) DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITIONS. If shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an incentive stock option are disposed of within two years following the date of grant or one year following the transfer of such shares to the participant upon exercise, the participant shall be required, within 30 days after such disposition, to notify Disney in writing of the date and terms of such disposition and provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Committee may reasonably require.
 
(a) AWARD OF SARS. The Committee may grant SARs to such optionees as the Committee may select from time to time, either on a free-standing basis (without regard to the grant of a stock option) or on a tandem basis (related to the grant of an underlying stock option). SARs granted on a free-standing basis may be awarded by the Committee for a number of shares, at a base price, upon terms for vesting and exercise and upon such other terms and conditions as are consistent with such comparable terms
 
applicable to the grant of stock options under the Plan (including this Appendix A), except to the extent specifically provided herein with respect to SARs. SARs granted on a tandem basis in connection with any stock option granted under the Plan (either at the time such option is granted or thereafter at any time prior to the exercise, termination or expiration of such option) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the related stock option and shall be exercisable only to the extent such option is exercisable. Upon exercise of a tandem SAR and surrender of a related stock option, the number of shares to be charged against the number of shares referred to in Section 5 of the Plan shall be the number of shares subject to the surrendered stock options, and the number of shares shall be reduced accordingly. Upon exercise of a freestanding SAR, the number of shares to be charged against the number of shares referred to in Section 5 of the Plan shall be the number of shares subject to the freestanding SARs so exercised, and the number of shares shall be reduced accordingly.
(b) AMOUNT OF PAYMENT UPON EXERCISE OF SARS. An SAR shall entitle the recipient thereof to receive, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such rules and regulations as may be established by the Committee, a payment having an aggregate value equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the fair market value on the exercise date of one share over (B) the base price per share, times the number of shares called for by the SAR, or portion thereof, which is exercised. In the case of exercise of a tandem SAR, such payment shall be made in exchange for the surrender of the unexercised related stock option (or any portion or portions thereof which the recipient from time to time determines to surrender for this purpose).
(c) FORM OF PAYMENT UPON EXERCISE OF SARS. The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether the payment upon exercise of an SAR shall be made in the form of all cash, all shares, or any combination thereof. The Committee may impose such restrictions upon the forms of payment upon exercise of an SAR as it may deem necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. If upon settlement of the exercise of an SAR a participant is to receive a portion of such payment in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares shall be determined by dividing such portion by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date. No fractional shares will be issued and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be given in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated.
 
The Committee may provide, in the Stock Option or SAR Agreement, or any amendment thereto, evidencing the award, the extent to which a stock option or SAR granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the participant during his lifetime or upon his death. The terms and conditions of any such transferability shall be established by the Committee in accordance with the requirements of Section 9(b) of the Plan. Incentive stock options shall not be transferable except as provided in Section 6 hereof. A beneficiary designation authorized pursuant to any other provision hereof shall not be deemed to be an assignment, transfer or encumbrance for purposes hereof.
 
Each option or SAR awarded under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement or SAR Agreement (which need not be identical to other Stock Option or SAR Agreements) executed on behalf of Disney by a member of the Committee or by an officer designated by the Committee and by the participant which shall set forth the terms and conditions of the option and SAR, if any (including, in the case of incentive stock options, such terms as shall be requisite in the judgment of the Committee pursuant to Section 422 of the Code), either expressly or by reference to the Plan and which may contain other provisions provided they are neither inconsistent with nor prohibited by the Plan. The Committee may make modifications to a Stock Option or SAR Agreement as are not inconsistent with or prohibited by the Plan. However, no modification of any Stock Option or SAR Agreement shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in a written instrument executed on behalf of Disney by a member of the Committee or by an officer designated by the Committee and, if adverse to the optionee, by the optionee. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no statement, undertaking or representation purporting to confer or affect any rights under the Plan, whether oral or written, made by any director, officer or employee of Disney or any Affiliate shall modify the terms of any Stock Option or SAR Agreement or constitute a grant of additional options or rights under the Plan.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions in Section 4 of this Appendix A, this Section 10 applies to options that were granted for the purchase of the Disney Internet Group Common Stock under the Plan and subsequently converted to options for the purchase of the Common Stock pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan (the "Former GO.com Options").
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Stock Option Agreement, the Former GO.com Option of any participant whose employment with Disney or one of its Affiliates is terminated for any reason shall terminate on the date which is 60 days following the participant's termination of employment, other than in cases of termination on account of death or permanent and total disability (as provided below), and shall remain exercisable following such termination of employment only as to those shares that were exercisable on the date of participant's termination of employment. The Committee shall have authority in its discretion to determine in each case whether an authorized leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of employment for purposes hereof, as well as the effect of a leave of absence on the vesting and exercisability of a Former GO.com Option.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event of termination of employment or discharge of a participant "for cause", as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion (the basis for which may, but need not be, specified in the Stock Option Agreement), then, subject to the terms of the Stock Option Agreement, any Former GO.com Option held by such participant under the Plan, not theretofore exercised, shall terminate immediately upon such termination or discharge
 
and may not be exercised thereafter. The Committee may authorize any officer or officers of Disney or its Affiliates to have standing authority to suspend the exercise of Former GO.com Options by any participant with respect to whom grounds for a "for cause" termination may exist, as determined in the sole discretion of such officer or officers. Any such duly authorized officer may suspend the ability of any such participant to exercise a Former GO.com Option pending the final determination of the Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee in the Stock Option Agreement, in the event employment is terminated by the participant's death, any shares subject to a Former GO.com Option that would otherwise have become exercisable within the twelve-month period following the date of death shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable upon the date of death (and no additional shares shall vest), and all such shares and all previously vested but unexercised shares shall be exercisable until the expiration of such twelve-month period. However, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in the Stock Option Agreement, in the event of the death of the participant after the date of termination of employment with Disney or any of its Affiliates and while any Former GO.com Options remain outstanding, no further vesting shall occur and such deceased participant's vested Former GO.com Options shall expire on the date that is 60 days following the participant's death. All vested Former GO.com Options of any participant who dies prior to the expiration of such option may be exercised by the participant's beneficiary as designated by the participant on such forms and in accordance with such procedures as are required or authorized by the Committee (a "Designated Beneficiary") or, in the absence of an authorized designation, a legatee or legatees of the Former GO.com Options under the participant's last will, or by such participant's executors, personal representatives or distributees.
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee in the Stock Option Agreement, in the event employment is terminated by the participant's permanent and total disability, any shares subject to a Former GO.com Option that would otherwise have become exercisable within the first three months following the date of permanent and total disability shall continue to vest in accordance with their terms (and no additional shares shall vest), and all such shares and previously vested shares shall be exercisable until the date that is twelve months following the date of permanent and total disability. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to determine whether a participant's employment has been terminated on account of permanent and total disability.
The Committee may accelerate vesting and exercisability or waive exercisability or vesting conditions of a Former GO.com Option, and may extend the period of exercise of a Former GO.com Option following termination of employment (subject to its maximum term), in any circumstances as it deems appropriate.
For purposes hereof, the Committee shall have the sole power to make all determinations regarding the termination of any participant's employment, including, but not limited to, the effective time thereof for the purposes of this Plan, the cause(s) therefor and the consequences thereof. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if an entity ceases to be an Affiliate of Disney or otherwise ceases to be qualified under the
 
Plan or if all or substantially all of the assets of an Affiliate of Disney are conveyed (other than by encumbrance), such cessation or action, as the case may be, shall be deemed for purposes hereof to be a termination of the employment of each employee of that entity.

Subject to the express limitations of the Plan, the Committee shall have authority in its discretion to determine the Eligible Persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards may be granted, the number of shares, units or other rights subject to each Award, the exercise, base or purchase price of an Award (if any), the time or times at which an Award will become vested, exercisable or payable, the performance goals and other conditions of an Award, the duration of the Award, and all other terms of the Award. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to amend the terms of an Award in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan, provided that no such action shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant with respect to an outstanding Award without the Participant's consent. The Committee shall also have discretionary authority to interpret the Plan and Award Agreements issued under the Plan, to make factual determinations under the Plan, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for Plan administration, including, without limitation, to correct any defect, to supply any omission or to reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement hereunder. The Committee may prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan. The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee selectively among Participants and Eligible Persons, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. The Committee shall, in its discretion, consider such factors as it deems relevant in making its interpretations, determinations and actions under the Plan including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or employee of the Company or such attorneys, consultants, accountants or other advisors as it may select.

Shares Subject to the Plan
4.1 . Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued and sold under all Awards granted under the Plan shall be 27 million shares.

Shares of Common Stock issued and sold under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or shares held in the Company's treasury. To the extent that any Award involving the issuance of shares of Common Stock is forfeited, cancelled, returned to the Company for failure to satisfy vesting requirements or other conditions of the Award, or otherwise terminates without an issuance of shares of Common Stock being made thereunder, the shares of Common Stock covered thereby will no longer be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations and may again be made subject to Awards under the Plan pursuant to such limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon exercise of a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares subject to the Award that are then being exercised shall be counted against the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan as provided above, on the basis of one share for every share subject thereto, regardless of the actual number of shares used to settle the Stock Appreciation Right upon exercise. Any Awards or portions thereof that are settled in cash and not in shares of Common Stock shall not be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations.
Maximum Share Limitations
 
4.2 . The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in the aggregate granted to any one Participant during any five consecutive calendar year period shall be 4.5 million shares. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Awards of Restricted Stock, Stock Units and Stock Awards in the aggregate granted to any one Participant during any five consecutive calendar year period shall be 2.5 million shares.

Individual Participant Limitations
4.3 . If there shall occur any change with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to the shares of Common Stock, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, spin-off, or other similar corporate change, or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent it considers equitable to the Participants and consistent with the terms of the Plan, cause an adjustment to be made in (i) the maximum number and kind of shares provided in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 hereof, (ii) the number and kind of shares of Common Stock, units, or other rights subject to then outstanding Awards, (iii) the exercise or base price for each share or unit or other right subject to then outstanding Awards, and (iv) any other terms of an Award that are affected by the event.

6.3 . The Committee shall in its discretion prescribe the time or times at which, or the conditions upon which, a Stock Option or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable, and may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Option at any time. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Vesting of Stock Options
6.4 . The Committee shall in its discretion prescribe in an Award Agreement the period during which a vested Stock Option may be exercised, provided that the maximum term of a Stock Option shall be ten years from the Date of Grant.

Term of Stock Options
6.5 . Subject to Section 6.8 hereof with respect to Incentive Stock Options, the Stock Option of any Participant whose Service with the Company or one of its Affiliates is terminated for any reason shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the date that the Stock Option expires in accordance with its terms or (B) unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, and except for termination for cause (as described in Section 12.2 hereof), the expiration of the applicable time period following termination of Service, in accordance with the following: (1) twelve months if Service ceased due to Disability, (2) eighteen months if Service ceased at a time when the Participant is eligible to elect immediate commencement of retirement benefits at a specified retirement age under a pension plan to which the Company or any of its Affiliates had made contributions, (3) eighteen months if the Participant died while in the Service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (4) three months if Service ceased for any other reason. During the foregoing applicable period, except as otherwise specified in the Award Agreement or in the event Service was terminated by the death of the Participant, the Stock Option may be exercised by such Participant in respect of the same number of shares of Common Stock, in the same manner, and to the same extent as if he or she had remained in the continued Service of the Company or any Affiliate during the first three months of such period; provided that no additional rights shall vest after such three months. The Committee shall have authority to determine in each case whether an authorized leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of Service for purposes hereof, as well as the effect of a leave of absence on the vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if an
Termination of Service
 
entity ceases to be an Affiliate or otherwise ceases to be qualified under the Plan or if all or substantially all of the assets of an Affiliate are conveyed (other than by encumbrance), such cessation or action, as the case may be, shall be deemed for purposes hereof to be a termination of the Service.
6.6 . Subject to such terms and conditions as shall be specified in an Award Agreement, a Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the term thereof by notice in the form required by the Company, together with payment of the aggregate exercise price therefor and applicable withholding tax.

In addition to and at the time of payment of the exercise price, the Participant shall pay to the Company the full amount of any and all applicable income tax, employment tax and other amounts required to be withheld in connection with such exercise, payable under such of the methods described above for the payment of the exercise price as may be approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.
Stock Option Exercise; Tax Withholding
6.7 . All Stock Options shall be nontransferable except (i) upon the Participant's death, in accordance with Section 13.2 hereof or (ii) in the case of Nonqualified Stock Options only, for the transfer of all or part of the Stock Option to a Participant's "family member" (as defined for purposes of the Form S-8 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933), as may be approved by the Committee in its discretion at the time of proposed transfer. The transfer of a Nonqualified Stock Option may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may in its discretion impose from time to time. Subsequent transfers of a Nonqualified Stock Option shall be prohibited other than in accordance with Section 13.2 hereof.

Additional Rules for Incentive Stock Options
(a) . An Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to an Eligible Person who is considered an employee for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.421-7(h) with respect to the Company or any Affiliate that qualifies as a "subsidiary corporation" with respect to the Company for purposes of Section 424(f) of the Code.
Eligibility
(b) . No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to a Participant as a result of which the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Date of Grant) of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code are exercisable for the first time in any calendar year under the Plan and any other stock option plans of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation, would exceed $100,000, determined in accordance with Section 422(d) of the Code. This
Annual Limits
 
limitation shall be applied by taking stock options into account in the order in which granted.
(c) . An Award of an Incentive Stock Option may provide that such Stock Option may be exercised not later than 3 months following termination of employment of the Participant with the Company and all Subsidiaries, or not later than one year following a permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as and to the extent determined by the Committee to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.
Termination of Employment
(d) . Any Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as are deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee, which terms, together with the terms of the Plan, shall be intended and interpreted to cause such Incentive Stock Option to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. An Award Agreement for an Incentive Stock Option may provide that such Stock Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent that certain requirements applicable to "incentive stock options" under the Code shall not be satisfied. An Incentive Stock Option shall by its terms be nontransferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only by such Participant.
Other Terms and Conditions; Nontransferability
(e) . If shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of within two years following the Date of Grant or one year following the transfer of such shares to the Participant upon exercise, the Participant shall, promptly following such disposition, notify the Company in writing of the date and terms of such disposition and provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Company may reasonably require.
Disqualifying Dispositions
6.9 . Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.3 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Option that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of such a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York Stock Exchange.
Repricing Prohibited
7. .
Stock Appreciation Rights
7.1 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted on a basis that allows for the exercise of the right by the Participant or that provides for the automatic payment of the right upon a specified date or event.
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
7.2 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted without any related Stock Option. The Committee shall in its discretion provide in an
Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights
 
Award Agreement the time or times at which, or the conditions upon which, a Stock Appreciation Right or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable, and may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Appreciation Right at any time. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Appreciation Right may be based on the continued Service of a Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods). on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. A Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable or payable at such time or times as determined by the Committee, provided that the maximum term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be ten years from the Date of Grant. The base price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted without any related Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the base price per share of any such freestanding Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the Date of Grant.
7.3 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted in tandem with a Stock Option, either at the time of grant or at any time thereafter during the term of the Stock Option. A tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder to elect, as to all or any portion of the number of shares subject to the Award, to exercise either the Stock Option or the Stock Appreciation Right, resulting in the reduction of the corresponding number of shares subject to the right so exercised as well as the tandem right not so exercised. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option hereunder shall have a base price per share equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option, will be vested and exercisable at the same time or times that a related Stock Option is vested and exercisable, and will expire no later than the time at which the related Stock Option expires.
Tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Rights
7.4 . A Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder, upon exercise or other payment of the Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, to receive an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise or payment of the Stock Appreciation Right over the base price of such Stock Appreciation Right, by (ii) the number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Right is exercised or paid. Subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, payment of the amount determined under the foregoing may be made, as approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, in shares of Common Stock valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or payment, in cash, or in a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements.
Payment of Stock Appreciation Rights
7.5 . Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.3 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Appreciation Right that would have the effect of reducing the base price of such a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Appreciation Right that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York Stock Exchange.

The requirements for vesting of a Restricted Stock Award may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. If the vesting requirements of a Restricted Stock Award shall not be satisfied, the Award shall be forfeited and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award shall be returned to the Company.
Vesting Requirements
8.3 . Shares granted under any Restricted Stock Award may not be transferred, assigned or subject to any encumbrance, pledge, or charge until all applicable restrictions are removed or have expired, unless otherwise allowed by the Committee. Failure to satisfy any applicable restrictions shall result in the subject shares of the Restricted Stock Award being forfeited and returned to the Company. The Committee may require in an Award Agreement that certificates representing the shares granted under a Restricted Stock Award bear a legend making appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed, and that certificates representing the shares granted or sold under a Restricted Stock Award will remain in the physical custody of an escrow holder until all restrictions are removed or have expired.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8 and the applicable Award Agreement, the Participant shall have all rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares granted to the Participant under a Restricted Stock Award, including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement for the payment of dividends and distributions to the Participant at such times as paid to shareholders generally or at the times of vesting or other payment of the Restricted Stock Award.

9.2 . On the Date of Grant, the Committee shall in its discretion determine any vesting requirements with respect to a Stock Unit Award, which shall be set forth in the Award Agreement, provided that the Committee may accelerate the vesting of a Stock Unit Award at any time. The requirements for vesting of a Stock Unit Award may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. A Stock Unit Award may also be granted on a fully vested basis, with a deferred payment date.
Vesting of Stock Unit Awards
9.3 . A Stock Unit Award shall become payable to a Participant at the time or times determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, which may be upon or following the vesting of the Award. Payment of a Stock Unit Award may be made, at the discretion of the Committee, in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination thereof, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements. Any cash payment of a Stock Unit Award shall be made based upon the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, determined on such date or over such time period as determined by the Committee.
Payment of Stock Unit Awards
9.4 r. The Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares subject to a Stock Unit Award until such time as shares of Common Stock are delivered to the Participant pursuant to the terms of the Award Agreement.
No Rights as Shareholde

Stock Awards
10.1 . A Stock Award may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee.

Effect of Change in Control
 
Plan shall not be applicable), and except as may be limited by the provisions of Section 11.3 hereof, notwithstanding anything elsewhere in the Plan or any rules adopted by the Committee pursuant to the Plan to the contrary, if a Triggering Event shall occur within the 12-month period beginning with a Change in Control of the Company, then, effective immediately prior to such Triggering Event, (i) each outstanding Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right, to the extent that it shall not otherwise have become vested and exercisable, shall automatically become fully and immediately vested and exercisable, without regard to any otherwise applicable vesting requirement, (ii) each Restricted Stock Award shall become fully and immediately vested and all forfeiture and transfer restrictions thereon shall lapse, and (iii) each outstanding Stock Unit Award shall become immediately and fully vested and payable.
11.2 .
Definitions
(a) . For purposes of this Section 11, the term "Cause" shall mean a determination by the Committee that a Participant (i) has been convicted of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony under Federal or state law, (ii) has engaged in willful gross misconduct in the performance of the Participant's duties to the Company or an Affiliate or (iii) has committed a material breach of any written agreement with the Company or any Affiliate with respect to confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation or similar restrictive covenant. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11.1 hereof, in the event that a Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that defines a termination on account of "Cause" (or a term having similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of a termination on account of "Cause" for purposes hereof, but only to the extent that such definition provides the Participant with greater rights. A termination on account of Cause shall be communicated by written notice to the Participant, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the Participant.
Cause
(b) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred upon:
Change in Control
(i) the occurrence of (A) an acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a percentage of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Company Voting Securities"), but excluding (1) any acquisition directly from the Company (other than an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege of a security that was not acquired directly from the Company), (2) any acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate and (3) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate) (an "Acquisition") that is thirty percent (30%) or more of the Company Voting Securities; and (B) the termination of employment, within six (6) months following the Acquisition, of the individual who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company immediately prior to the Acquisition, for any reason other than death, Disability, Cause, or voluntary resignation (but excluding any termination
 
that constitutes a Constructive Termination or any resignation that was requested by the Board or any such Person (or its employees or representatives) that completes an Acquisition);
(ii) at any time during a period of two (2) consecutive years or less, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board (and any new directors whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was so approved) cease for any reason (except for death, Disability or voluntary retirement) to constitute a majority thereof:
(iii) an Acquisition that is fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company Voting Securities;
(iv) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar corporate transaction, whether or not the Company is the surviving company in such transaction, other than a merger, consolidation, or reorganization that would result in the Persons who are beneficial owners of the Company Voting Securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportions, at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company Voting Securities (or the voting securities of the surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization;
(v) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
(vi) the approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
(vii) the occurrence of any transaction or event, or series of transactions or events, designated by the Board in a duly adopted resolution as representing a change in the effective control of the business and affairs of the Company, effective as of the date specified in any such resolution.
(c) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Constructive Termination" shall mean a termination of employment by a Participant within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of any one or more of the following events without the Participant's written consent (i) any reduction in position, title (for Vice Presidents or above), overall responsibilities, level of authority, level of reporting (for Vice Presidents or above), base compensation, annual incentive compensation opportunity, aggregate employee benefits or (ii) a request that the Participant's location of employment be relocated by more than fifty (50) miles. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11.1 hereof, in the event that a Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any Affiliate (or a successor entity) that defines a termination on
Constructive Termination
 
account of "Constructive Termination," "Good Reason" or "Breach of Agreement" (or a term having a similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of "Constructive Termination" for purposes hereof in lieu of the foregoing, but only to the extent that such definition provides the Participant with greater rights. A Constructive Termination shall be communicated by written notice to the Committee, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the Committee, unless the circumstances giving rise to the Constructive Termination are cured within five (5) days of such notice.
(d) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Triggering Event" shall mean (i) the termination of Service of a Participant by the Company or an Affiliate (or any successor thereof) other than on account of death, Disability or Cause, (ii) the occurrence of a Constructive Termination or (iii) any failure by the Company (or a successor entity) to assume, replace, convert or otherwise continue any Award in connection with the Change in Control (or another corporate transaction or other change effecting the Common Stock) on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to such transaction, except for equitable adjustments to reflect changes in the Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof.
Triggering Event
11.3 . In the event that the vesting of Awards together with all other payments and the value of any benefit received or to be received by a Participant would result in all or a portion of such payment being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Participant's payment shall be either (i) the full payment or (ii) such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable Federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Participant, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of the payment notwithstanding that all or some portion of the payment may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. All determinations required to be made under this Section 11 shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers or any other nationally recognized accounting firm which is the Company's outside auditor immediately prior to the event triggering the payments that are subject to the Excise Tax (the "Accounting Firm"). The Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide detailed supporting calculations of its determinations to the Company and the Participant. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. The Accounting Firm's determinations must be made with substantial authority (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code). For the purposes of all calculations under Section 280G of the Code and the application of this Section 11.3, all determinations as to present value shall be made using 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code) compounded semiannually , as in effect on December 30, 2004.
Excise Tax Limit

Forfeiture Events
12.1 . The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement at the time of the Award that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events shall include, but shall not be limited to, termination of Service for cause,
General
 
violation of material Company policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company.
12.2 . Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement, if a Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate shall be terminated for cause, the Company may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate such Participant's right to any further payments, vesting or exercisability with respect to any Award in its entirety. In the event a Participant is party to an employment (or similar) agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that defines the term "cause," such definition shall apply for purposes of the Plan. The Company shall have the power to determine whether the Participant has been terminated for cause and the date upon which such termination for cause occurs. Any such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Participant. In addition, if the Company shall reasonably determine that a Participant has committed or may have committed any act which could constitute the basis for a termination of such Participant's employment for cause, the Company may suspend the Participant's rights to exercise any option, receive any payment or vest in any right with respect to any Award pending a determination by the Company of whether an act has been committed which could constitute the basis for a termination for "cause" as provided in this Section 12.2.
Termination for Cause
13. .
General Provisions
13.1 . To the extent deemed necessary by the Committee, an Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in a written or electronic form approved by the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock or units subject to the Award, the exercise price, base price, or purchase price of the Award, the time or times at which an Award will become vested, exercisable or payable and the term of the Award. The Award Agreement may also set forth the effect on an Award of termination of Service under certain circumstances. The Award Agreement shall be subject to and incorporate, by reference or otherwise, all of the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan, and may also set forth other terms and conditions applicable to the Award as determined by the Committee consistent with the limitations of the Plan. Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee need not require the execution of an Award Agreement by a Participant, in which case, acceptance of the Award by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the Participant to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as well as the administrative guidelines of the Company in effect from time to time.
Award Agreement
13.2 . In the event of the death of a Participant while employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, an outstanding Award may be exercised by or shall become payable to the Participant's beneficiary as designated by the Participant in the manner prescribed by the Committee or, in the absence of an authorized beneficiary designation, by the a legatee or
Treatment of Awards upon Death
 
legatees of such Award under the participant's last will, or by such Participant's executors, personal representatives or distributees of such Award in accordance with the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution (a "Beneficiary"). In the case of Stock Options, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, any outstanding Stock Options of a Participant who dies while in Service may be exercised by such Beneficiary in respect of all or any part of the total number of shares subject to such options at the time of such Participant's death (whether or not, at the time of death, the deceased Participant would have been entitled to exercise such options to the extent of all or any of the shares covered thereby). However, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, in the event of the death of the Participant after the date of termination of Service while an Option remains outstanding, then such deceased Participant's Options shall expire in accordance with their terms at the same time they would have expired if such Participant had not died, and may be exercised prior to their expiration by a Beneficiary in respect to the same number of shares, in the same manner and to the same extent as if such Participant were then living. In the case of Awards other than Stock Options, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, any outstanding Awards of a Participant who dies while in Service shall become fully vested and, in the case of Stock Appreciation Rights, exercisable as provided above with respect to stock options, and in the case of all other types of Awards, payable to the Beneficiary promptly following the Participant's death.
13.3 . Except as provided in Sections 6.7 and 13.2 hereof, Awards under the Plan shall not be assignable or transferable by the Participant, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall not be subject in any manner to assignment, alienation, pledge, encumbrance or charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide in the terms of an Award Agreement or in any other manner prescribed by the Committee that the Participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be entitled to any rights, payments or other benefits specified under an Award following the Participant's death. During the lifetime of a Participant, an Award shall be exercised only by such Participant or such Participant's guardian or legal representative.
No Assignment or Transfer; Beneficiaries
13.4 . The Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to the Participant by virtue of the exercise of a right or the satisfaction of vesting or other conditions with respect to an Award. If any such deferral is to be permitted by the Committee, the Committee shall establish rules and procedures relating to such deferral in a manner intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, the time when an election to defer may be made, the time period of the deferral and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount, the interest or other earnings attributable to the deferral and the method of funding, if any, attributable to the deferred amount.
Deferrals of Payment
13.5 . Nothing in the Plan, in the grant of any Award or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Eligible Person or any Participant any right to continue in the Service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of an Eligible employee or a Participant for any reason at any time.
Employment or Service
 
13.6 . A Participant shall have no rights as a holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to any unissued securities covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of such securities. Except as provided in Section 4.3 hereof, no adjustment or other provision shall be made for dividends or other shareholder rights, except to the extent that the Award Agreement provides for dividend payments or dividend equivalent rights. The Committee may determine in its discretion the manner of delivery of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan, which may be by delivery of stock certificates, electronic account entry into new or existing accounts or any other means as the Committee, in its discretion, deems appropriate. The Committee may require that the stock certificates be held in escrow by the Company for any shares of Common Stock or cause the shares to be legended in order to comply with the securities laws or other applicable restrictions, or should the shares of Common Stock be represented by book or electronic account entry rather than a certificate, the Committee may take such steps to restrict transfer of the shares of Common Stock as the Committee considers necessary or advisable.
Rights as Shareholder
13.7 . No shares of Common Stock will be issued or transferred pursuant to an Award unless and until all then applicable requirements imposed by Federal and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations and by any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, and by any exchanges upon which the shares of Common Stock may be listed, have been fully met. As a condition precedent to the issuance of shares pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Award, the Company may require the Participant to take any reasonable action to meet such requirements. The Committee may impose such conditions on any shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under the requirements of any exchange upon which such shares of the same class are then listed, and under any blue sky or other securities laws applicable to such shares. The Committee may also require the Participant to represent and warrant at the time of issuance or transfer that the shares of Common Stock are being acquired only for investment purposes and without any current intention to sell or distribute such shares.
Securities Laws
13.8 . The Participant shall be responsible for payment of any taxes or similar charges required by law to be paid or withheld from an Award or an amount paid in satisfaction of an Award. Any required withholdings shall be paid by the Participant on or prior to the payment or other event that results in taxable income in respect of an Award. The Award Agreement may specify the manner in which the withholding obligation shall be satisfied with respect to the particular type of Award.
Tax Withholding
13.9 . The adoption of the Plan and any reservation of shares of Common Stock or cash amounts by the Company to discharge its obligations hereunder shall not be deemed to create a trust or other funded arrangement. Except upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to an Award, any rights of a Participant under the Plan shall be those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company, and neither a Participant nor the Participant's permitted transferees or estate shall have any other interest in any assets of the Company by virtue of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to implement or set aside funds in a grantor trust, subject to the claims of the Company's creditors or otherwise, to discharge its obligations under the Plan.
Unfunded Plan
 
13.10 . The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other share incentive or other compensation plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company from establishing any other forms of share incentive or other compensation or benefit program for employees of the Company or any Affiliate. The amount of any compensation deemed to be received by a Participant pursuant to an Award shall not constitute includable compensation for purposes of determining the amount of benefits to which a Participant is entitled under any other compensation or benefit plan or program of the Company or an Affiliate, including, without limitation, under any pension or severance benefits plan, except to the extent specifically provided by the terms of any such plan.
Other Compensation and Benefit Plans
13.11 . The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its transferees and assigns, and the Participant, the Participant's executor, administrator and permitted transferees and beneficiaries.
Plan Binding on Transferees
13.12 . If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.
Severability
13.13 . The Committee may adopt, amend and terminate such arrangements and grant such Awards, not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan, as it may deem necessary or desirable to comply with any tax, securities, regulatory or other laws of other jurisdictions with respect to Awards that may be subject to such laws. The terms and conditions of such Awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the Plan solely to the extent the Committee deems necessary for such purpose. Moreover, the Board may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of the Plan, not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan, as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose.
Foreign Jurisdictions
13.14 . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Committee to grant Awards under the Plan in connection with the acquisition, whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction, of the business or assets of any corporation or other entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may grant Awards under the Plan to an employee or director of another corporation who becomes an Eligible Person by reason of any such corporate transaction in substitution for awards previously granted by such corporation or entity to such person. The terms and conditions of the substitute Awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the Plan solely to the extent the Committee deems necessary for such purpose.
Substitute Awards in Corporate Transactions
13.15 . For purposes of Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Stock Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, such Awards shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Company's 2002 Executive Performance Plan (or any successor plan) to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Coordination with 2002 Executive Performance Plan
 
13.16 . To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and all Awards hereunder comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and all Award Agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement is determined by the Committee to not comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such changes to the Plan or an Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary to comply with such requirements, provided that no such action shall adversely affect any outstanding Award without the consent of the affected Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code at the time of termination of Service with respect to an Award, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of any payments or benefits under the Award shall be deferred until the date that is six months following the Participant's termination of Service (or such other period as required to comply with Section 409A).
Section 409A Compliance
13.17 . The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be subject to and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws, and to applicable Federal securities laws.
Governing Law
14. .
Effective Date; Amendment and Termination

Effective Date
14.2 . The Board may at any time and from time to time and in any respect, amend or modify the Plan.

No amendment or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award theretofore granted without the consent of the Participant or the permitted transferee of the Award.
Amendment
14.3 . The Plan shall terminate on December 30, 2011, which is the seventh anniversary of the date of its adoption by the Board. The Board may, in its discretion and at any earlier date, terminate the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award theretofore granted without the consent of the Participant or the permitted transferee of the Award.
