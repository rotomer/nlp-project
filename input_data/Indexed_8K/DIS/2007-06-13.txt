The distribution agent aggregated all fractional shares of ABC Radio Holdings common stock, exchanged the resulting whole shares for shares of Citadel common stock in the merger, will sell those shares on the open market and distribute to Disney shareholders otherwise entitled to the fractional shares their portion of the cash proceeds from those sales.
 
Immediately following the spin-off, ABC Radio Holdings merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citadel. As a result of the merger, ABC Radio Holdings became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citadel and Disney shareholders received one share of Citadel common stock in exchange for each whole share of ABC Radio Holdings received in the spin-off. An aggregate of 151,707,199 shares of Citadel common stock were issued to Disney shareholders in the merger.
