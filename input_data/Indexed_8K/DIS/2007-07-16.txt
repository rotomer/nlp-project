This Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series C. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

This Note is redeemable at any time on or after the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the registered Holder hereof, at the Redemption Price equal to the amount set forth below, together in each case with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture.
The Redemption Price shall be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or (2) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points.  The Redemption Price will be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

For purposes of calculating the Redemption Price, the terms below shall have the following meanings:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of those Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker, from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment and banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means: (i) BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors; provided that, if any such firm ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City ("Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) up to two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date.
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.  If fewer than all of the Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
4
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Notes so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).

Kenny Rate, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate or EURIBOR, which rate may be adjusted by adding or subtracting the Spread or multiplying the Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier depending on whether a Spread or Spread Multiplier is specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The "Spread," if any, is the number of basis points to be added to or subtracted from the Base Rate or Rates, as specified above, and the "Spread Multiplier," if any, is the percentage of the Base Rate or Rates, as specified above, by which such Base Rate or Rates are to be multiplied. The "Index Maturity," if any, is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related Base Rate or Rates are calculated, as designated above. If more than one Base Rate is specified above, the applicable Base Rate shall be the lowest of such Base Rates on the Interest Determination Date.

If the Maturity of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth below, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed co-authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company  (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture. This Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series C. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
This Note may not be redeemed prior to the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above. If no Earliest Redemption Date is so set forth, this Note is not redeemable prior to the Maturity Date. This Note is redeemable at any time on or after the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the registered Holder hereof, at the Redemption Price equal to the amount set forth above, together in each case with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture.
All notices  of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Base Rate or Rates and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on and including the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon

However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.  If fewer than all of the Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Base Rate or Rates and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Notes so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.

If neither rate is so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Prime Rate for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent as the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 (as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, or if fewer than four such rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates) in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Disney). If the banks Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, "Reuters Screen USPRIME1" means the display designated as page "USPRIME1" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service, or any successor service or page, for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks.

  If CMT Rate is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the CMT Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
Determination of CMT Rate.
"CMT Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (a "CMT Interest Determination Date") relating to a CMT Rate Note or any Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is determined with reference to the CMT Rate,

If the
Determination of J.J. Kenny Rate.
J.J. Kenny Rate is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the J.J. Kenny Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
"J.J. Kenny Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (a "J.J. Kenny Rate Interest Determination Date"), the per annum rate on the date equal to the index made available and subsequently published by Kenny Information Systems or its successor. The rate will be based upon 30-day yield evaluations at par of bonds of not less than five "high grade" component issuers. The bonds evaluated will be bonds on which the interest is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Kenny Information Systems will select such issuers from time to time, including issuers of general obligation bonds. However, the bonds on which the index is based will not include any bonds the interest on which may trigger an "alternative minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless such tax may be imposed on all tax-exempt bonds.
If such rate is not made available by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to that J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date, the J.J. Kenny Rate will be the rate quoted by a successor indexing agent selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Disney). This rate will be equal to the prevailing rate for bonds included in the highest short-term rating category by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corporation for issuers selected by such successor indexing agent most closely resembling the "high grade" component issuers selected by Kenny Information Systems. The bonds for which rates are quoted will be bonds that may be tendered by their holders for purchase on not more than seven days' notice and the interest on which: is variable on a weekly basis; is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Code; and does not give rise to an "alternate minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless all tax-exempt bonds give rise to such a tax. If a successor indexing agent is not available, the J.J. Kenny Rate on the J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date will be the J.J. Kenny Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, the J.J. Kenny Rate will be the Initial Interest Rate.
Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate.
  If the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
"
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date"), the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date falls as set forth under the caption "11
th
 District" on the display on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7058 (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) ("Telerate Page 7058") as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on Telerate page 7058 on any related Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce the rate for the calendar month next preceding the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for that date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on that Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date.
The "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index" will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that the FHLB of San Francisco most recently announced as the cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the date of the announcement.
Determination of EURIBOR. 
If EURIBOR is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest
12
rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to EURIBOR and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
"EURIBOR" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (a "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"),
the offered rates for deposits in Euros for the period of the Index Maturity specified above, commencing on the Interest Reset Date, which appears on page 248 on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service or any page that may replace page 248 on that service, which is commonly referred to as "Telerate Page 248" as of 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on that date.  If EURIBOR cannot be determined on a EURIBOR Interest Determination Date as described in the preceding sentence, then the Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market and request that the principal Euro-zone offices of those four selected banks provide their offered quotations to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date. These quotations shall be for deposits in Euros for the period of the specified Index Maturity, commencing on such Interest Reset Date. Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time. If two or more quotations are provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, the Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the Euro-zone and then determine EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period as the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by those four major banks in the Euro-zone to leading European banks at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date. The rates quoted will be for loans in Euros, for the period of the specified Index Maturity, commencing on the Interest Reset Date. Rates quoted must be based on a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time.  If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as described above, EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period will be the same for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, EURIBOR will be the Initial Interest Rate.
"Euro-zone" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union.
  If this Note is designated as a Renewable Note above (a "Renewable Note"), the following provisions will apply:
Renewable Notes.
A Renewable Note will bear interest at the Base Rate specified above and the interest rate payable with respect to a Renewable Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the specified Base Rate or Base Rates and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above.
A Renewable Note will mature on an Interest Payment Date as specified above (the "Initial Maturity Date"), unless the maturity of all or any portion of the principal amount hereof is extended in accordance with the procedures described below.  On the Interest Payment Dates specified above (each such Interest Payment Date, an "Election Date"), the maturity of a Renewable Note will be extended to the Interest Payment Date occurring twelve months after such Election Date, unless the Holder hereof elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of a Renewable Note or of any portion hereof having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof by delivering a notice of such effect to the Trustee not less than nor more than a number of days to be specified in the Pricing Supplement prior to such Election Date.  If no notice period is specified in the Pricing Supplement, such notice shall be given no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to such Election Date.  Such option may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of a Renewable Note; provided that the principal amount for which such option is not exercised is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maturity of a Renewable Note may not be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date specified above (the "Final Maturity Date").  If the Holder hereof elects to
13
terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of any portion of the principal amount of a Renewable Note and such election is not revoked as described below, such portion will become due and payable on the Interest Payment Date falling six months (unless another period is specified in the Pricing Supplement) after the Election Date prior to which the Holder made such election.
An election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity may be revoked as to any portion of a Renewable Note having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof by delivering a notice to such effect to the Trustee on any day following the effective date of the election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity and prior to the date 15 days before the date on which such portion would otherwise mature.  Such a revocation may be made for less than the entire principal amount of a Renewable Note for which the automatic extension of maturity has been terminated; provided that the principal amount of a Renewable Note for which the automatic extension of maturity has been terminated and for which such a revocation has not been made is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a revocation may not be made during the period from and including a Record Date to but excluding the immediately succeeding Interest Payment Date.
An election to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of a Renewable Note, if not revoked as described above by the Holder hereof making the election or any subsequent Holder, will be binding upon such subsequent Holder.
A Renewable Note may be redeemed in whole or in part at the option of the Company on the Interest Payment Dates in each year specified above, commencing with the Interest Payment Date specified above, at a redemption price as stated above, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, notice of redemption will be provided by mailing a notice of such redemption to each Holder by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 180 days (unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement) prior to the date fixed for redemption.
  The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period commencing on the Interest Reset Date or Dates with respect to such Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the applicable "Interest Determination Date." The Commercial  Paper Interest  Determination  Date, the Federal Funds Interest Determination Date and the Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date.  The CD Interest Determination Date, the CMT Interest Determination Date and the J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date will be the second Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the second London Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the second TARGET Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date.  The Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date will be the last working day of the month immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco publishes the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index.  The Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the day in the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which day Treasury Bills would normally be auctioned or, if no such auction is held for a particular week, the first Business Day of that week; that if, as a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday; and that if an auction shall fall on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day immediately following such auction. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to a Note the interest rate of which is determined with reference to two or more Base Rates will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date for such a Note on which each Base Rate shall be determinable. Each Base Rate shall be determined and compared on such date, and the applicable interest rate shall take effect on the related Interest Reset Date.
Applicable Interest Determination Date and Calculation Date.
provided, however,
provided, further,
The "Calculation Date," if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date, shall be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next
14
succeeding Business Day and (b) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The Trustee will, upon the request of the Holder of this Note, provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective as a result of the determination made for the next Interest Reset Date.
The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate on this Note in accordance with the foregoing rate or rates on or before each Calculation Date and shall promptly thereafter notify the Company of such interest rate. Any such calculation by the Calculation Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Trustee and the Holder of this Note, absent manifest error.
Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest hereon has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest shall have been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the case of the Commercial Paper Rate, LIBOR, CD Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Prime Rate, J.J. Kenny Rate, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and EURIBOR and by the actual number of days in the year, in the case of the Treasury Rate and CMT Rate. Unless otherwise specified above, if the interest rate for this Note is calculated with reference to two or more Base Rates, the interest factor for this Note will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only the lowest of the applicable Base Rates applied.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
15

The following provisions shall be of the same force and effect as if set forth in the Medium-Term Note of the Walt Disney Company to which this Addendum is attached.
This Note constitutes a portion of the Company's Floating Rate Global Notes due 2010, issued by the Company on the Original Issue Date specified above in the aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 (the "Floating Rate Notes").  The Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder of any Floating Rate Note who is a United States Alien, as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on such Floating Rate Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on such Floating Rate Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in such Floating Rate Note to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

Re:
                              
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of $750,000,000 principal amount of the Company's Floating Rate Global Notes Due 2010 (the "2010 Floating Rate Notes") and $350,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 6.00% Global Notes Due 2017 (the "2017 Fixed Rate Notes" and, together with the 2010 Floating Rate Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to the pricing supplement dated July 12, 2007 supplementing (i) the prospectus supplement dated March 10, 2005 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and (ii) the prospectus dated February 8, 2005 (the "Base Prospectus") that forms part of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-122139) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by the Company, and by Disney Capital Trust I, Disney Capital Trust II and Disney Capital Trust III, each a statutory business trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto (such registration statement, as so amended, the "Registration Statement").  As used in this letter, the term "Prospectus" means, collectively, the Pricing Supplement, Prospectus Supplement and Base Prospectus.  The Notes are to be issued under a Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
We have examined (i) the Prospectus, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the Indenture, (iv) the form of Floating Rate Notes, (v) the form of Fixed Rate Notes, (vi) the executed Terms Agreements, each dated as of July 12, 2007, among the Company, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., CastleOak Securities, L.P., Loop Capital Markets, LLC, Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc., Samuel A. Ramirez & Company, Inc., and The Williams Capital Group, L.P. (together, the "Terms Agreements"), (vii) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended and currently in effect (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), (viii) the Bylaws of the Company as currently in effect (the "Bylaws"), (ix) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to, among other things,
the Registration Statement and the securities to be sold thereunder (the "Board Resolutions"), and (x) officers' certificates executed by duly authorized officers of the Company establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Board Resolutions.  We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, or as retrieved from the SEC's EDGAR database, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  We also have assumed that the Senior Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.  In making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all their obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which were not independently established or verified by us, we have, with your consent, relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
The Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms when the Notes shall have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture and the Board Resolutions and shall have been duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor.
The foregoing opinion as to enforceability of obligations of the Company is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such principles, a court may include a covenant of good faith and fair dealing and apply concepts of reasonableness and materiality).
Members of our firm are admitted to the Bar in the State of New York and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as in
2
effect on the date hereof.  We disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement, and to all references to our firm included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the related rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
