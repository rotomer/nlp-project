Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Cabrera Capital Markets, LLC, CastleOak Securities, L.P., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., Loop Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Samuel A. Ramirez & Co., Inc., RBC Capital Markets Corporation, Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P. and The Williams Capital Group, L.P. (each an "Agent" and collectively, the "Agents") with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes, Series D (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). As of the date hereof, the Company has authorized the issuance and sale of up to U.S. $5,000,000,000 aggregate initial offering price (or its equivalent, based upon the applicable exchange rate at the time of issuance, in such foreign currencies or composite currencies as the Company shall designate in the Notes at the time of issuance) of Notes directly or through the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Such Notes are in addition to other Medium-Term Notes of the Company outstanding at the date hereof. It is understood, however, that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance of additional Notes and that, at the option of the Company, such Notes may be distributed through or sold to the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance of such Notes were authorized as of the date hereof.
 
This Agreement provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to purchasers, in which case the Agents will act as agents of the Company in soliciting Note purchasers, and (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and one or more Agents) to such Agent or Agents as principal for resale to purchasers.
 
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-148043) for the registration of debt securities and other securities, including the Notes, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement became effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(e) of the 1933 Act Regulations (as so amended, if applicable) and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). Such registration statement (and any further registration statements that may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional Notes and which the Company and the Agents agree is to be covered by this Agreement) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof, together with any prospectus supplement and pricing supplement relating to the Notes, including, in each case, all Incorporated Documents (as hereinafter defined), as from time to time amended or supplemented by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), or the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively, except that, if any revised prospectus shall be provided to the Agents by the Company for use in connection with the offering of the Notes which is not required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus from
and after the time it is first provided to the Agents for such use. In addition, any reference herein to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include, in addition to the information expressly set forth therein, only the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission for the most recently completed fiscal year (the "Annual Report"), and the documents, financial statements and schedules filed subsequent to the last day of such fiscal year incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act, and any reference to any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents, financial statements and schedules filed by the Company with the Commission under the 1934 Act after the date hereof, and so incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference (such incorporated documents, financial statements and schedules being herein called the "Incorporated Documents"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement any prospectus or prospectus supplement prepared or filed with respect to an offering pursuant to the Registration Statement of securities other than the Notes shall not be deemed to have supplemented the Prospectus.

(iii)
         
 
Any offer that is a written communication relating to the Notes made prior to the filing of the Registration Statement by the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c) of the 1933 Act Regulations) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the exemption provided by Rule 163 of the 1933 Act Regulations ("Rule 163") and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163, including, without limitation, the legending requirement, to qualify such offer for the exemption from Section 5(c) of the 1933 Act provided by Rule 163.

Except as contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or reflected therein by the filing of any amendment or supplement thereto or
(viii)
       
any Incorporated Document, since the date of the most recent consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, unless the Company has notified the Agents as provided in Section 3(d) hereof, there has not been any material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.
 
The Company is not in violation of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as amended. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and any applicable Terms Agreement will not conflict with or constitute a breach of or a default (with the passage of time or otherwise) under (A) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as amended, of the Company, (B) subject to the Company's compliance with any applicable covenants pertaining to its incurrence of unsecured indebtedness contained therein, any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound, or to which any of the properties or assets of the Company is subject, which breach or default would, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, or (C) any applicable law, administrative regulation or administrative or court decree.

Such historical financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus. The unaudited pro forma financial statements, if any, together with the related notes and any supporting schedules
(x)
           
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, fairly present the information shown therein and have been compiled on a basis substantially consistent with the audited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; the assumptions on which such unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared are reasonable; and such unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared, and the pro forma adjustments set forth therein have been applied, in accordance with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations (including, without limitation, Regulations S-X promulgated by the Commission), and such pro forma adjustments have been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such statements.

SECTION 2.
          
Solicitations as Agents; Purchases as Principals
 
. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes directly on its own behalf and to any person, to sell Notes through others (provided that any other agent will execute an agreement with the Company which contains substantially the same terms and conditions contained herein), and to designate and select additional agents to become party to this Agreement, the Company hereby (i) appoints each Agent as an agent of the Company for the purpose of soliciting offers to purchase the Notes from the Company by others and (ii) agrees that whenever the Company determines to sell Notes directly to an Agent as principal for resale to others, it will enter into a Terms Agreement relating to such sale in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(b) hereof. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Agents are not authorized to appoint sub-agents or to engage the services of any other broker or dealer in connection with the offer or sale of the Notes; provided, that without the Company's consent, the Agents may solicit offers to purchase the Notes from other brokers or dealers. In connection with the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes, without the prior consent of the Company, the Agents are not authorized to provide any written information relating to the Company to any prospective purchaser other than the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes from the Company has been solicited by such Agent, as agent, and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason.
(a)
          
Solicitations as Agents
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes through the Agents commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Agents will, as soon as possible, suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.
 
The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, which such Agent is hereby authorized to deduct from the sales proceeds of each Note sold by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of each such Note, as set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Without the consent of the Company, no Agent, as an agent, may reallow any portion of the commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of any Notes.
 
As an agent, each Agent is authorized, except during periods of suspension as provided in this Agreement, to solicit offers to purchase the Notes. Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer to purchase Notes received by such Agent, as agent. Each Agent shall have the right in its discretion reasonably exercised to reject any offer to purchase the Notes received by such Agent which it does not deem reasonable, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of such Agent's agreements contained herein. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed to be a breach of any agreement of the Company contained herein. The purchase price, interest rate, maturity date and other terms of the Notes agreed upon by the Company shall be set forth in a pricing supplement to the Prospectus to be prepared following each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes (a "Pricing Supplement"). Except as may be otherwise provided in any Pricing Supplement, each Note will be issued in the denomination of U.S. $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of U.S. $1,000. All Notes will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Company. Each Agent acknowledges and agrees that any funds which such Agent receives in respect of a purchase of Notes, which purchase has been solicited by such Agent, as agent of the Company, will be received, held and disposed of by such Agent, as agent of the Company, subject to the right of such Agent to deduct from the sale proceeds the applicable commission as set forth on Exhibit A hereto.
 
If requested by a prospective purchaser of Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the Agent soliciting the offer to purchase will use its reasonable efforts to arrange for the conversion of U.S. dollars into such currency to enable the purchaser to pay for such Notes. Such requests must be made on or before the third business day preceding the date of delivery of the Notes, or by such other dates as determined by such Agent. Each such conversion will be made by the relevant Agent on such terms and subject to such conditions, limitations and charges as such Agent may from time to time establish in accordance with its regular foreign exchange practice. All costs of exchange will be borne by purchasers of the Notes.
 
. Each sale of Notes to an Agent as principal shall be made in accordance with the terms contained herein and pursuant to a separate agreement which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and any reoffering thereof by, such Agent. Each such separate agreement (which may be an oral agreement if confirmed within 24 hours
(b)
          
Purchases as Principal
thereafter by an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication (including facsimile transmission) between the Agent and the Company) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement." Unless the context otherwise requires, each reference contained herein to "this Agreement" shall be deemed to include any applicable Terms Agreement between the Company and the Agent. Each such Terms Agreement, whether oral (and confirmed in writing, which confirmation may be by facsimile transmission) or in writing shall be with respect to such information (as applicable) as is specified in Exhibit B hereto. An Agent's commitment to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. The Agents may offer the Notes they have purchased as principal to other dealers. The Agents may sell Notes to any dealer at a discount and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, such discount allowed to any dealer will not be in excess of the discount to be received by such Agent from the Company. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Terms Agreement, any Notes sold to an Agent as principal will be purchased by such Agent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to the commission applicable to any agency sale of a Note of identical maturity.
 
. Administrative procedures with respect to the sale of Notes shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Agents and the Company (the "Procedures"). The Procedures initially agreed upon shall be those set forth in Exhibit C hereto. The Agents and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by the Agents and the Company herein and in the Procedures.

. The Company covenants with each Agent as follows:
SECTION 3.
          
Covenants of the Company
 
. The Company will notify the Agents promptly of (i) the designation and selection of additional agents to become party to this Agreement, (ii) the designation and selection of additional agents for the sale of Notes pursuant to any agreement other than this Agreement, (iii) the effectiveness of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement (other than a post-effective amendment relating solely to an offering of debt securities other than the Notes), (iv) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus (other than a Pricing Supplement or a supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (v) the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (other than any comments relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (vi) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or for additional information (other than any such request relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (vii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, and (viii) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Notes.. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any such stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible time unless the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine that it is not in its best interest to do so. The Company shall

(c)
          
Copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
 
. So long as the Agents are required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales or solicitations of offers to purchase the Notes, if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, after consultation with counsel for the Agents, to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, prompt notice shall be given, and confirmed in writing, to the Agents to cease the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in their capacity as agents and to cease sales of any Notes the Agents may then own as principal.

. The Company will (i) comply, in a timely manner, with all applicable requirements under the 1934 Act relating to the filing with the Commission of the Company's reports pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act and, if then applicable, of the Company's proxy statements pursuant to Section 14 of the 1934 Act and (ii) use its best efforts to obtain the written consent of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm as to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement of the audited financial statements reported on by them and contained in the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K under the 1934 Act.

Compliance with 1934 Act; Accountants' Consents

The Company will make generally available to its security holders, in each case as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 15 months after the acceptance by the Company of an offer to purchase Notes hereunder, a consolidated earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering the twelve-month period beginning after the latest of (i) the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such acceptance and (iii) the date of the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such acceptance, which earnings statement will satisfy the provisions of Section 11 (a) of the 1933 Act (and, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Agent holds Notes purchased for resale pursuant to a Terms Agreement the Company shall comply with the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of this Section 3 during the 90 day period from and including the date of execution of such Terms Agreement; , , that the Company shall have the right, in its reasonable business judgment, to suspend such compliance during such 90 day period for an aggregate of up to 45 days, in which event such 90 day period shall be extended by the greater of (i) the number of days included in any such period of suspension and (ii) 30 days.

SECTION 5.
          
Conditions of Obligations
 
. On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received an opinion from Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, counsel to the Company, dated as of the date hereof and in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents to the effect that:
(a)
          
Opinion of Counsel to Company
 
The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(i)
            
 
The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture, to borrow money as contemplated in this Agreement and the Indenture and to issue, sell and deliver the Notes.
(ii)
           
 
This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(iii)
          
The Indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification that the enforceability of the Indenture is subject to and may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such principles, a court might include a covenant of good faith and fair dealing and apply concepts of reasonableness and materiality), (c) public policy or similar considerations that may limit enforceability of indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit a party's liability, (d) provisions of law which may require that a judgment for money damages rendered by a court in the United States be expressed only in United States dollars, (e) requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a judgment denominated other than in U.S. dollars in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law and (f) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States or in foreign currency, currency units or composite currencies.
(iv)
          
 
No Governmental Approval is required on the part of the Company in connection with the issuance or sale of the Notes, other than registration thereof under the 1933 Act, the qualification of the Indenture under the 1939 Act, and such registrations or qualifications as may be necessary under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various United States jurisdictions in which the Notes are to be offered or sold.
(v)
           
 
The Notes, when the final terms of a particular Note and its issuance and sale have been established in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and when executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the purchasers thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to the qualification that the enforceability of the Notes is subject to and may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such principles, a court might include a covenant of good faith and fair dealing and apply concepts of reasonableness and materiality), (c) public policy or similar considerations that
(vi)
          
may limit enforceability of indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit a party's liability, (d) provisions of law which may require that a judgment for money damages rendered by a court in the United States be expressed only in United States dollars, (e) requirements that a claim with respect to any Notes denominated other than in U.S. dollars (or a judgment denominated other than in U.S. dollars in respect of such claim) be converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a date determined pursuant to applicable law and (f) governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States or in foreign currency, currency units or composite currencies.
 
The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" that became effective upon filing under the 1933 Act and the Indenture has been qualified under the 1939 Act, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated.
(vii)
         
 
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Indenture by the Company, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture will not (A) violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, as amended, of the Company, (B) violate any Applicable Laws or (C) breach or otherwise violate any obligation of or restriction on the Company under any judgment, decree or order, applicable to the Company and known to such counsel, of any court or Governmental Authority entered in any proceeding to which the Company was or is now a party or by which it is bound; provided, that such counsel may state that no opinion is expressed as to the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various jurisdictions in which any of the Notes are to be offered.
(viii)
        
 
The Registration Statement, as of its initial effective date (and, if the opinion is being given pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof as a result of the Company having entered into a Terms Agreement, at the time of filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Agents pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations), and the Prospectus, as of the date of the prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the related applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder then in effect, except that in each case such counsel need not express an opinion as to (i) the Incorporated Documents, (ii) the financial statements, schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or (iii) the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including, without limitation, the Statement of Eligibility under the 1939 Act of the Trustee on Form T-1 incorporated by reference therein (the "Form T-1").
(ix)
          
The statements in the Prospectus (and, if the opinion is being given pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof as a result of the Company having entered into a Terms Agreement, the General Disclosure Package) under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes," insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, fairly present the information required by Form S-3.
(x)
           
 
In rendering the opinions set forth above, such counsel may state that, with respect to Notes the payments of principal or interest on which will be determined by reference to one or more currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity indices or other factors, no opinion is expressed with respect to the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or the rules, regulations and interpretations of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission promulgated thereunder.

Such counsel may also state that such counsel has participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and the Agents in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and has considered the matters required to be stated therein and the statements contained therein. However, such counsel shall state that, based upon and subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to such counsel's attention that causes such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the time it became effective (and, if the opinion is being given pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof as a result of the Company having entered into a Terms Agreement, at the time of filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year and at each deemed effective date with respect to the Agents pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of the date of this Agreement (and, if the opinion is being given pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof as a result of the Company having entered into a Terms Agreement, as of the date of such Terms Agreement and as of the Settlement Date with respect to such Terms Agreement) includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or, if the opinion is being given pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof as a result of the Company having entered into a Terms Agreement, that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time with respect to such Terms Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, (except in each case as to the financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom and, in the case of the Registration Statement, except as to exhibits thereto (including, without limitation, the Form T-1, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion).
 
. On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received an opinion from David K. Thompson, Senior Vice President-Deputy General Counsel  Corporate, or from other counsel employed by the Company (provided that such counsel is at least a Vice President of the Company), dated as of the date hereof and in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Agents, to the effect that:

(iv)
         
 
To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Indenture will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default (with the passage of time or otherwise) under, any material contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject.

. On the date hereof, the Agents shall have received a letter from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, dated as of the date hereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that:
(e)
          
Comfort Letter

Any such Agent or any such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action, suit or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be at the expense of such Agent or such controlling person unless (A) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (B) the Company shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel or (C) the named parties to any such action, suit or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) shall include both such Agent or such controlling person and the Company, and such Agent or such controlling person shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from, or additional to, those available to the Company (in which case, if such Agent or such controlling person notifies the Company in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Company, the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action, suit or proceeding on behalf of such Agent or such controlling person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Agents and such controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by a majority of all such Agents, on behalf of all of such Agents and such controlling persons).

SECTION 8.
          
Contribution
the Agents participating in the offering that gave rise to such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses (a "Relevant Agent") on the other hand from the offering of such Notes. If however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof or pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 8, then the Company and each Relevant Agent shall contribute to such aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by the Company and the Relevant Agents, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Relevant Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Relevant Agent on the other hand in connection with the offering of such Notes shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of such Notes by such Relevant Agent received by the Company (before deducting expenses) bear to the total commissions or other compensation or remuneration received by such Relevant Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Relevant Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. If more than one Agent is a Relevant Agent in respect of a proceeding, each Relevant Agent's obligation to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 shall be several and not joint, and shall be in the proportion that the principal amount of the Notes that are the subject of such proceeding and that were offered and sold through such Relevant Agent bears to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that are the subject of such proceeding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. Any party entitled to contribution pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this Section 8, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 8 or otherwise; , , that such notice need not be given if such party entitled to contribution hereunder has previously given notice pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof with respect to the same action, suit or proceeding.

The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing holders of Notes, issue additional Notes having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
(c)    Each Note will be issued in fully registered book-entry form (a "Book-Entry Note") or definitive form (a "Definitive Note"), as set forth in the pricing supplement to the Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement relating to such Note (the "Pricing Supplement").  Upon issuance, all Notes in book-entry form having the same original issue date, Stated Maturity and otherwise having identical terms and provisions will be represented by a single global security (each a "Global Security"); , , that if by reason of the foregoing a single Global Security would exceed $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, one Global Security will be issued to represent each $500,000,000 of aggregate principal amount and an additional Global Security will be issued to represent any remaining principal amount.

Book-Entry Notes will not be exchangeable for Definitive Notes except that, if the Depositary with respect to any Global Security or Securities is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, the Company will issue Definitive Notes in exchange for the Book-Entry Notes represented by any such Global Security or Securities.  In addition, the Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine not to have a Global Security or Securities, and, in such event, will issue Definitive Notes in exchange for the Book Entry Notes represented by such Global Security or Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8 of the Indenture.

The Pricing Supplement relating to each Note will indicate whether the Company has the option to extend the Stated Maturity of such Note for one or more whole year periods (each an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity Date") set forth in such Pricing Supplement and the basis or formula, if any, for setting the interest rate or the Spread or Spread Multiplier (as defined below), as the case may be, applicable to any such Extension Period.
 
The Company may exercise such option with respect to a Note by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such Note in effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity Date").  No later than 40 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity Date, the Trustee will mail to the holder of such Note a notice (the "Extension Notice") relating to such Extension Period, first class, postage prepaid, setting forth (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity of such Note, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, the interest rate applicable to the Extension Period or, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, the Spread or Spread Multiplier applicable to the Extension Period, and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by the Trustee of an Extension Notice to the holder of a Note, the Stated Maturity of such Note shall be extended automatically as set forth in the Extension Notice, and, except as modified by the Extension
Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity Date for a Note, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate, in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, or the Spread or Spread Multiplier, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate, in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, or a higher Spread or Spread Multiplier, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, for the Extension Period by mailing or causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher interest rate or higher Spread or Spread Multiplier, as the case may be, first class, postage prepaid, to the holder of such Note.  Such notice shall be irrevocable.  All Notes with respect to which the Original Stated Maturity Date is extended will bear such higher interest rate, in the case of a Fixed Rate Note, or higher Spread or Spread Multiplier, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, for the Extension Period.
 
If the Company elects to extend the Stated Maturity of a Note, the holder of such Note may, if provided for in the applicable Pricing Supplement, have the option to elect repurchase of such Note by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to such date.

Rates of Interest.
  Interest-bearing Notes will bear interest at either a fixed rate (the "Fixed Rate Notes") or a rate determined by reference to one or more Base Rates (as defined below) which may be adjusted by a Spread or Spread Multiplier (the "Floating Rate Notes") specified in the applicable Floating Rate Note or the applicable Pricing Supplement.  In no event will the rate of interest payable on any Fixed Rate Note or Floating Rate Note be in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. 
Discount Notes may be issued at significant discounts from their principal amount payable at Stated Maturity and some Discount Notes may be zero coupon Notes which will bear no interest, except in the case of default in payment of principal upon acceleration or redemption (if applicable), or may bear no interest for a specified period following the date of issue.  Interest on each Fixed Rate Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
(ii)
          
Interest Payment Dates.
  Unless otherwise specified in a Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on February l and August 1 of each year, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of original issue, and at Maturity. Interest on Floating Rate Notes will be payable in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates applicable to such Note and at Maturity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date of original issue of a Note is between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date, the first payment of interest on such Note will be made on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date.
 
Except as provided below or in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest will be payable (1) in the case of a Floating Rate Note which resets daily, weekly or monthly, other than an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note (as defined below), on the third Wednesday of each month or on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year, as specified in the applicable Floating Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; (2) in the case of an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note, on the first calendar day of each March, June, September and December; (3) in the case of a Floating Rate Note which resets quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; (4) in the case of a Floating Rate Note which resets semiannually, on the third Wednesday of each of the two months specified in the Floating Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and (5) in the case of a
Floating Rate Note which resets annually, on the third Wednesday of the month specified in the Floating Rate Note and in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and, in each case, at Maturity.
 
If any Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) for a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day with respect to such Note, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the following day that is a Business Day with respect to such Note, except that, in the case of a LIBOR Note or a EURIBOR Note (or a Note for which LIBOR (as defined below) or EURIBOR (as defined below) is the applicable Base Rate), if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day with respect to such Floating Rate Note.  If the Maturity of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day with respect to such Note, the payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with respect to such Note, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity.
 
If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity of a Fixed Rate Note or a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day with respect to such Fixed Rate Note or Floating Rate Note, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day with respect to such Fixed Rate Note or Floating Rate Note as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  However, if the Floating Rate Note is determined with reference to the provisions under the heading "Determination of LIBOR" or "Determination of EURIBOR" in the prospectus supplement and such following Business Day is in the succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day.
(iii)   Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, with respect to Fixed Rate Notes, the Regular Record Dates for interest payable on each February l and August 1 will be the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15 (whether or not a Business Day), respectively.  Unless otherwise specified in a Floating Rate Note, the Regular Record Date or Dates for interest payable on such Floating Rate Note will be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately preceding the related Interest Payment Date or Dates.
Regular Record Dates.
 
(iv)   Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, each Note will bear interest from the date of original issue at the rate per annum, or, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, pursuant to the interest rate formula stated therein, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment.  Each interest payment shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the date of original issue if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to such Note) to but excluding the applicable next succeeding Interest Payment Date (an "Interest Accrual Period").

Determination of Interest on Floating Rate Notes.
 
(i)
           
Base Rates.
  Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, interest on a Floating Rate Note will be determined by reference to a "Base Rate," which may be one or more of the following:  (l) the Commercial Paper Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "Commercial Paper Rate Note"; (2) LIBOR, in which case such Note will be a "LIBOR Note"; (3) the CD Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "CD Rate Note"; (4) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "Federal Funds Rate Note"; (5) the Treasury Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "Treasury Rate Note"; (6) the Prime Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "Prime Rate Note"; (7) the CMT Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "CMT Rate Note"; (8) the J.J. Kenny Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a "J.J. Kenny Rate Note"; (9) the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate (as defined below), in which case such Note will be an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note"; (10) EURIBOR (as defined below), in which case such Note will be a EURIBOR Note; or
(11) such other Base Rate or interest rate formula as may be set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement.  In addition, a Floating Rate Note may bear interest calculated by reference to the lowest of two or more Base Rates determined in the same manner as the Base Rates are determined for the types of Notes described above.  Each Floating Rate Note will specify the Base Rate or Rates applicable thereto.
 
(ii)  The interest rate on each Floating Rate Note will be calculated by reference to the specified Base Rate or the lowest of two or more specified Base Rates, in either case plus or minus the Spread, if any, or multiplied by the Spread Multiplier, if any. The "Spread" is the number of basis points to be added to or subtracted from the related Base Rate or Rates applicable to such Floating Rate Note.  The "Spread Multiplier" is the percentage of the related Base Rate or Rates to be multiplied to determine the applicable interest rate on such Floating Rate Note.  The "Index Maturity" is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related Base Rate or Rates are calculated.  Each Floating Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement will specify the Index Maturity and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, applicable thereto.
Calculation of Rate by Reference to Base Rate and, as Applicable, Spread, Spread Multiplier and Index Maturity. 
 
(iii)   Each Floating Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement will specify whether the rate of interest on such Floating Rate Note will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually (each, an "Interest Reset Date") and the period between Interest Reset Dates (each, an "Interest Reset Period").  Unless otherwise specified in a Floating Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Reset Date will be, in the case of a Floating Rate Note which resets (l) daily, each Business Day; (2) weekly, the Wednesday of each week (with the exception of weekly reset Treasury Rate Notes, which reset the Tuesday of each week, except as specified in paragraph (iv) below); (3) monthly, the third Wednesday of each month, other than Eleventh District Cost
Interest Reset Periods; Interest Reset Date.
of Funds Rate Notes, which will reset the first calendar day of each month; (4) quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; (5) semiannually, the third Wednesday of each of the two months specified in such Pricing Supplement; and (6) annually, the third Wednesday of the month specified in such Pricing Supplement.  If any Interest Reset Date for any Floating Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note or a EURIBOR Note (or a Note for which LIBOR or EURIBOR is the applicable Base Rate), if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the last Business Day in the preceding month.
 
(iv)    The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period commencing on the Interest Reset Date or Dates with respect to such Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the applicable "Interest Determination Date." Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, (a) the Interest Determination Date with respect to a Commercial Paper Rate Note (the "Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date"), a Federal Funds Rate Note (the "Federal Funds Interest Determination Date") and a Prime Rate Note (the "Prime Rate Interest Determination Date"), will be the Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date, (b) the Interest Determination Date with respect to a CD Rate Note (the "CD Interest Determination Date"), and a J.J. Kenny Rate Note (the "J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date"), will be the second Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date, (c) the Interest Determination Date with respect to a LIBOR Note (the "LIBOR Interest Determination Date") will be the second London Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date, (d) the Interest Determination Date with respect to a EURIBOR Note (the "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date") will be the second TARGET Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date, (e) the Interest Determination Date with respect to an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note (the "Eleventh District Cost
Interest Determination Date.
of Funds Interest Determination Date") will be the last working day of the month immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco publishes the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index and (f) the Interest Determination Date with respect to a CMT Rate Note (the "CMT Interest Determination Date") will be the second U.S. Government Securities Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date.  Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Determination Date with respect to a Treasury Rate Note (the "Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date"), will be the day in the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which day Treasury Bills (as defined below) normally would be auctioned or, if no such auction is held for a particular week, the first Business Day of that week; , , that if, as a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday; and , , that if an auction shall fall on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day immediately following such auction.  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Determination Date pertaining to a Note the interest rate of which is determined with reference to two or more Base Rates will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date for such Note on which each Base Rate shall be determinable.  Each Base Rate shall be determined and compared on such date, and the applicable interest rate shall take effect on the related Interest Reset Date.

(v)
          
Maximum and Minimum Limits on Interest Rates.
  Any Floating Rate Note and the applicable Pricing Supplement may specify either or both a maximum limit and a minimum limit on the rate at which interest may accrue during any Interest Accrual Period. In addition to any maximum interest rate which may be applicable to any Floating Rate Note, the interest rate on Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general
application.  This limit may not apply to Floating Rate Notes in which $2,500,000 or more has been invested.
 
(vi)   The interest rate in effect with respect to a Floating Rate Note on each day that is not an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date and the interest rate in effect on any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to applicable provisions of law and any maximum or minimum interest rate limitations referred to above; , , that the interest rate in effect with respect to a Floating Rate Note for the period from the date of original issue to the first Interest Reset Date will be the rate specified as such therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "Initial Interest Rate").
Initial Interest Rate; Interest Rate Thereafter in Effect.
provided
however
 
(vii)  With respect to each Floating Rate Note, accrued interest is calculated by multiplying its face amount by an accrued interest factor.  Such accrued interest factor is computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the date of issue, or from the last date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the case of Commercial Paper Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, CD Rate Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, Prime Rate Notes J.J. Kenny Rate Notes, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes and EURIBOR Notes and by the actual number of days in the year, in the case of Treasury Rate Notes and CMT Rate Notes. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, the interest factor for Notes for which the interest rate is calculated with reference to two or more Base Rates will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only the lowest of the applicable Base Rates specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement applied.
Accrued Interest; Accrued Interest Factor. 
(viii)   All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) will be rounded upward to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of United States dollars, to the nearest cent, or in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upward).
Rounding of Percentages.
 
(ix)  Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Pricing Supplement, the Trustee will be the "Calculation Agent" with respect to all Floating Rate Notes.  Upon the request of the holder of any Floating Rate Note, the Trustee will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective as a result of a determination made for the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note.  If at any time the Trustee is not the Calculation Agent, the Company will notify the Trustee of each determination of the interest rate applicable to any such Floating Rate Note promptly after such determination is made by any successor Calculation Agent.  The "Calculation Date," where applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date is the date by which the applicable interest rate must be calculated and will be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day and (b) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be.

Calculation of Floating Rates.
  The interest rate in effect with respect to a Floating Rate Note from the date of issue to the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate.  The interest rate for each subsequent Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows:
(A)

The bonds evaluated will be bonds on which the interest is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Kenny Information Systems will select such issuers from time to time, including issuers of general obligation bonds. However, the bonds on which the index is based will not include any bonds the interest on which may trigger an "alternative minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless such tax may be imposed on all tax-exempt bonds.

income for federal income tax purposes under the Code; and does not give rise to an "alternate minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless all tax-exempt bonds give rise to such a tax. If a successor indexing agent is not available, the J.J. Kenny Rate on the J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date will be the J.J. Kenny Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, the J.J. Kenny Rate will be the Initial Interest Rate.

If such rate does not appear on the COFI/ARMS Page on any related Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce the rate for the calendar month next preceding the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for that date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on that Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date.

Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent in euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time. If two or more quotations are provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are
provided, the Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the euro-zone and follow the steps below.
 
(1)
          
The Calculation Agent will then determine EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period as the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by those four major banks in the euro-zone to leading European banks at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date.

In the case of a default in payment of principal upon acceleration or at Stated Maturity, the Accreted Value (as defined below) of this Note at the date of such default in payment shall bear interest at the Yield to Maturity specified above plus 1% per annum (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the date of such default in payment to the date payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for. Such interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, compounded semiannually. Payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of principal of and interest on this Note may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest, if any, on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.

(d)
          
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment on this Note;
 
(e)
          
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment on this Note, if such payment could be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent;
 
(f)
           
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation, identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of this Note if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by an applicable tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(g)
          
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on a Holder that actually or constructively owns 10 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company's stock or that is a bank receiving interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
 
(h)

any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h);
 
nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to a payment on this Note to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts (or payment of Additional Amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of this Note.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date specified above, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States on or after the Original Issue Date specified above, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.  If fewer than all of the Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Notes so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed
.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
 
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).

as Trustee
 
 
 
THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for at a rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate specified above until the first Interest Reset Date specified above following the Original Issue Date specified above and thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions below under the heading "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate," "Determination of LIBOR," "Determination of CD Rate," "Determination of Federal Funds Rate," "Determination of Treasury Rate," "Determination of Prime Rate," "Determination of CMT Rate," "Determination of J.J. Kenny Rate," "Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate" or "Determination of EURIBOR" depending upon whether the applicable Base Rate specified above is the Commercial Paper Rate, LIBOR, CD Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Treasury Rate, Prime Rate, CMT Rate, J.J. Kenny Rate, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate or EURIBOR, which rate may be adjusted by adding or subtracting the Spread or multiplying the Base Rate by the Spread Multiplier depending on whether a Spread or Spread Multiplier is specified above, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The "Spread," if any, is the number of basis points to be added to or subtracted from the Base Rate or Rates, as specified above, and the "Spread Multiplier," if any, is the percentage of the Base Rate or Rates, as specified above, by which such Base Rate or Rates are to be multiplied. The "Index Maturity," if any, is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation with respect to which the related Base Rate or Rates are calculated, as designated above. If more than one Base Rate is specified above, the applicable Base Rate shall be the lowest of such Base Rates on the Interest Determination Date. The Company will pay interest in arrears monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually as specified above under "Interest Payment Period," commencing with the first Interest Payment Date specified above next succeeding the Original Issue Date and thereafter on the Interest Payment Dates as specified above, and at Maturity. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date set forth above (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; that the interest payment at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If the Maturity of this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; that at the option of the Company, payments of principal of and interest on this Note may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest, if any, on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing
provided, however,
provided, however,
 
to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth below, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed co-authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

the Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder of hereof who is a United States Alien, as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on this Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on such this Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in this Note to
 
be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:
 
(a)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been so imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former connection between such Holder or beneficial owner of this Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor or beneficiary of, or a person holding a power over, such Holder, if such Holder is an estate or a trust, or a member or shareholder of such Holder, if such Holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, including, without limitation, such Holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or shareholder) being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States or treated as a resident thereof or being or having been engaged in a trade or business or present therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein or (ii) such Holder's or beneficial owner's past or present status, as applicable (under prior or current law), as a personal holding company, foreign personal holding company, foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization with respect to the United States, passive foreign investment company or controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes or corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid United States Federal income tax;
 
(b)           any estate, inheritance, gift, excise, sales, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(c)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the Holder of this Note for payment more than 10 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later;
 
(d)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment on this Note;
 
(e)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment on this Note, if such payment could be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent;
 
(f)            any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation, identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of this Note if such compliance is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by an applicable tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(g)           any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on a Holder that actually or constructively owns 10 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company's stock or that is a bank receiving interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;
 
(h)           any withholding or deduction imposed on a payment to an individual where such withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other European Union Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26th  27th November, 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or
 
(i)            any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h);
 
nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to a payment on this Note to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with
 
respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts (or payment of Additional Amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of this Note.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date specified above, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States on or after the Original Issue Date specified above, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Base Rate or Rates and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on and including the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.  If fewer than all of the Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Base Rate or Rates and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Notes so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.
 
Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified above following the Original Issue Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually
 
or annually as specified above under "Interest Reset Period." If any Interest Reset Date specified above would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if the rate of interest on this Note shall be determined with reference to the provisions under the heading "Determination of LIBOR" or "Determination of EURIBOR" below, and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the last Business Day in the preceding month. If any Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) specified above falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be the following day that is a Business Day, except that if the rate of interest on the Note shall be determined with reference to the provisions under the heading "Determination of LIBOR" or "Determination of EURIBOR" below, and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day. "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York; , that with respect to Notes the payment of which is to be made in a denominated currency other than U.S. dollars, such day is also not a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in the Principal Financial Center of the country of such denominated currency; that with respect to LIBOR Notes only, such day is also a London Business Day; that with respect to EURIBOR Notes and notes denominated in Euros only, such day is also a TARGET Business Day. "London Business Day" means any day on which commercial banks are open for business (including dealings in the LIBOR currency) in London.  "TARGET Business Day" means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System is open.

Determination of J.J. Kenny Rate.
If the
J.J. Kenny Rate is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the J.J. Kenny Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
"J.J. Kenny Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (a "J.J. Kenny Rate Interest Determination Date"), the per annum rate on the date equal to the index
 
made available and subsequently published by Kenny Information Systems or its successor. The rate will be based upon 30-day yield evaluations at par of bonds of not less than five "high grade" component issuers. The bonds evaluated will be bonds on which the interest is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Kenny Information Systems will select such issuers from time to time, including issuers of general obligation bonds. However, the bonds on which the index is based will not include any bonds the interest on which may trigger an "alternative minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless such tax may be imposed on all tax-exempt bonds.
If such rate is not made available by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to that J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date, the J.J. Kenny Rate will be the rate quoted by a successor indexing agent selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Disney). This rate will be equal to the prevailing rate for bonds included in the highest short-term rating category by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Corporation for issuers selected by such successor indexing agent most closely resembling the "high grade" component issuers selected by Kenny Information Systems. The bonds for which rates are quoted will be bonds that may be tendered by their holders for purchase on not more than seven days' notice and the interest on which: is variable on a weekly basis; is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Code; and does not give rise to an "alternate minimum tax" or similar tax under the Code, unless all tax-exempt bonds give rise to such a tax. If a successor indexing agent is not available, the J.J. Kenny Rate on the J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date will be the J.J. Kenny Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, the J.J. Kenny Rate will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate.
  If the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
"
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (an "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date"), the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date falls as set forth under the caption "11 Dist COFI" on the display on Reuters (or any successor service) on page COFI/ARMS (or any other page as may replace the specified page on that service) ("COFI/ARMS Page") as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on the COFI/ARMS Page on any related Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce the rate for the calendar month next preceding the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for that date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on that Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date.
th
 
The "Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index" will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that the FHLB of San Francisco most recently announced as the cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date.
 
Determination of EURIBOR. 
If EURIBOR is the Base Rate or one of the Base Rates specified above, the interest rate payable with respect to this Note shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent with reference to EURIBOR and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified above, in accordance with the following provisions:
 
"EURIBOR" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified below (a "EURIBOR Interest Determination Date"),
the offered rates for deposits in Euros for the period of the Index Maturity
 
specified above, commencing on the Interest Reset Date, which appears on Reuters on page EURIBOR 01, or any successor service or any page that may replace page EURIBOR 01 on that service, which is commonly referred to as "Reuters Page EURIBOR 01" as of 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on that date.  If EURIBOR cannot be determined on a EURIBOR Interest Determination Date as described in the preceding sentence, then the Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market and request that the principal Euro-zone offices of those four selected banks provide their offered quotations to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date. These quotations shall be for deposits in Euros for the period of the specified Index Maturity, commencing on such Interest Reset Date. Offered quotations must be based on a principal amount equal to at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time. If two or more quotations are provided, EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, the Calculation Agent will select four major banks in the Euro-zone and then determine EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period as the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by those four major banks in the Euro-zone to leading European banks at approximately 11:00 A.M., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date. The rates quoted will be for loans in Euros, for the period of the specified Index Maturity, commencing on the Interest Reset Date. Rates quoted must be based on a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time.  If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as described above, EURIBOR for the Interest Reset Period will be the same for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period. If there was no such Interest Reset Period, EURIBOR will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
"Euro-zone" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty on European Union.

If no notice period is specified in the Pricing Supplement, such notice shall be given no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to such Election Date.  Such option may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of a Renewable Note; provided that the principal amount for which such option is not exercised is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maturity of a Renewable Note may not be extended beyond the Final Maturity Date specified above (the "Final Maturity Date").  If the Holder hereof elects to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of any portion of the principal amount of a Renewable Note and such election is not revoked as described below, such portion will become due and payable on the Interest Payment Date falling six months (unless another period is specified in the Pricing Supplement) after the Election Date prior to which the Holder made such election.
 
An election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity may be revoked as to any portion of a Renewable Note having a principal amount of $1,000 or any multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof by delivering a notice to such effect to the Trustee on any day following the effective date of the election to terminate the automatic extension of maturity and prior to the date 15 days before the date on which such portion would otherwise mature.  Such a revocation may be made for less than the entire principal amount of a Renewable Note for which the automatic extension of maturity has been terminated; provided that the principal amount of a Renewable Note for which the automatic extension of maturity has been terminated and for which such a revocation has not been made is at least $1,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a revocation may not be made during the period from and including a Record Date to but excluding the immediately succeeding Interest Payment Date.
 
An election to terminate the automatic extension of the maturity of a Renewable Note, if not revoked as described above by the Holder hereof making the election or any subsequent Holder, will be binding upon such subsequent Holder.
 
A Renewable Note may be redeemed in whole or in part at the option of the Company on the Interest Payment Dates in each year specified above, commencing with the Interest Payment Date specified above, at a redemption price as stated above, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, notice of redemption will be provided by mailing a notice of such redemption to each Holder by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 180 days (unless otherwise specified in the Pricing Supplement) prior to the date fixed for redemption.
 
Applicable Interest Determination Date and Calculation Date.
  The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period commencing on the Interest Reset Date or Dates with respect to such Interest Reset Period will be the rate determined on the applicable "Interest Determination Date." The Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date, the Federal Funds Interest Determination Date and the Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Business Day preceding each Interest Reset Date.  The CD Interest Determination Date and the J.J. Kenny Interest Determination Date will be the second Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the second London Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date. The EURIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the second TARGET Business Day preceding such Interest Reset Date.  The Eleventh District Cost of Funds Interest Determination Date will be the last working day of the month immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco publishes the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index.  The CMT Interest Determination Date will be the second U.S. Government Securities Business Day preceding each such Interest Reset Date. The Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the day in the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls on which day Treasury Bills would normally be auctioned or, if no such auction is held for a particular week, the first Business Day of that week; that if, as a result of a legal holiday, an auction is held on the Friday of the week preceding the Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date shall be such preceding Friday; and that if an auction shall fall on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be the first Business Day immediately following such auction. The Interest Determination Date pertaining to a Note the interest rate of which is determined with reference to two or more Base Rates will be the latest Business Day which is at least two Business Days prior to such Interest Reset Date for such a Note on which each Base Rate shall be determinable. Each Base Rate shall be determined and compared on such date, and the applicable interest rate shall take effect on the related Interest Reset Date.
provided, however,
provided, further,
 
The "Calculation Date," if applicable, pertaining to any Interest Determination Date, shall be the earlier of (a) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date, or, if any such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day and (b) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be. The Trustee will, upon the request of the Holder of this Note, provide to such Holder the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective as a result of the determination made for the next Interest Reset Date.
 
The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate on this Note in accordance with the foregoing rate or rates on or before each Calculation Date and shall promptly thereafter notify the Company of such interest rate. Any such calculation by the Calculation Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Trustee and the Holder of this Note, absent manifest error.
 
Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest hereon has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest shall have been paid or duly provided for, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the case of the Commercial Paper Rate, LIBOR, CD Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Prime Rate, J.J. Kenny Rate, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and EURIBOR and by the actual number of days in the year, in the case of the Treasury Rate and CMT Rate. Unless otherwise specified above, if the interest rate for this Note is calculated with reference to two or more Base Rates, the interest factor for this Note will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only the lowest of the applicable Base Rates applied.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).

THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above. If Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after Maturity.  The principal of this Note shall not bear interest except in the case of a default in payment of principal upon acceleration or at Stated Maturity, and in such case, the Accreted Value (as defined below) of this Note at the date of such default in payment shall bear interest at the Yield to Maturity specified above plus 1% per annum (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from the date of such default in payment to the date payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for. Such interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, compounded semiannually. Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; however, that at the option of the Company, payments of principal of and interest on this Note may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest, if any, on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.
provided,
 
The "Accreted Value" of this Note at any date (the "Calculation Date") shall be equal to (i) the Original Issue Price of this Note specified above plus (ii) the accrued amortization of Original Issue Discount specified above attributable ratably on a daily basis to the period from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to but excluding the Calculation Date. The calculation of accrual of Original Issue Discount will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, compounded semiannually.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth below, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed co-authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Such portion shall be equal to the Accreted Value of this Note at the time of such declaration. Upon payment (i) of such Accreted Value and (ii) of interest on any overdue Accreted Value (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), all of the Company's obligations in respect of the payment of the principal of and interest on this Note shall terminate.
