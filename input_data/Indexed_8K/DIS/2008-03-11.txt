Subject to the express limitations of the Plan, the Committee shall have authority in its discretion to determine the Eligible Persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards may be granted, the number of shares, units or other rights subject to each Award, the exercise, base or purchase price of an Award (if any), the time or times at which an Award will become vested, exercisable or payable, the performance goals and other conditions of an Award, the duration of the Award, and all other terms of the Award. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to amend the terms of an Award in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan, provided that no such action shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant with respect to an outstanding Award without the Participant's consent. The Committee shall also have discretionary authority to interpret the Plan and Award Agreements issued under the Plan, to make factual determinations under the Plan, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for Plan administration, including, without limitation, to correct any defect, to supply any omission or to reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement hereunder.

The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee selectively among Participants and Eligible Persons, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. The Committee shall, in its discretion, consider such factors as it deems relevant in making its interpretations, determinations and actions under the Plan including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or employee of the Company or such attorneys, consultants, accountants or other advisors as it may select.

The Committee shall also be permitted to delegate, to any appropriate officer or employee of the Company, responsibility for performing certain ministerial functions under the Plan. In the event that the Committee's authority is delegated to officers or employees in accordance with the foregoing, all provisions of the Plan relating to the Committee shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the foregoing by treating any such reference as a reference to such officer or employee for such purpose. Any action undertaken in accordance with the Committee's delegation of authority hereunder shall have the same force and effect as if such action was undertaken directly by the Committee and shall be deemed for all purposes of the Plan to have been taken by the Committee.
Delegation of Authority

Shares Subject to the Plan
4.1 . Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued and sold under all Awards granted under the Plan shall be 91 million shares. From such aggregate Plan limit, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under all Awards of Restricted Stock, Stock Units and Stock Awards under the Plan shall be limited to 32 million shares. Shares of Common Stock issued and sold under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or shares held in the Company's treasury. To the extent that any Award involving the issuance of shares of Common Stock is forfeited, cancelled, returned to the Company for failure to satisfy vesting requirements or other conditions of the Award, or otherwise terminates without an issuance of shares of Common Stock being made thereunder, the shares of Common Stock covered thereby will no longer be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations and may again be made subject to Awards under the Plan pursuant to such limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon exercise of a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares subject to the Award that are then being exercised shall be counted against the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan as provided above, on the basis of one share for every share subject thereto, regardless of the actual number of shares used to settle the Stock Appreciation Right upon exercise. Any Awards or portions thereof that are settled in cash and not in shares of Common Stock shall not be counted against the foregoing maximum share limitations.
Maximum Share Limitations
4.2 . The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights in the aggregate granted to any one Participant during any five consecutive calendar year period shall be 4.5 million shares. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Awards of Restricted Stock, Stock Units and Stock Awards in the aggregate granted to any one Participant during any five consecutive calendar year period shall be 2.5 million shares. The foregoing limitations shall each be applied on an aggregate basis taking into account Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan as well as awards of the same type granted to a Participant under any other equity-based compensation plan of the Company or any Affiliate.
Individual Participant Limitations
4.3 . If there shall occur any change with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to the shares of Common Stock, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, spin-off, or other similar corporate change, or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent it considers equitable to the Participants and consistent with the terms of the Plan, cause an adjustment to be made in (i) the maximum number and kind of shares provided in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 hereof, (ii) the number and kind of shares of Common Stock, units, or other rights subject to then outstanding Awards, (iii) the exercise or base price for each share or unit or other right subject to then outstanding Awards, and (iv) any other terms of an Award that are affected by the event.

Grant of Stock Options
6.2 . The exercise price per share of a Stock Option shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the Date of Grant, provided that the Committee may in its discretion specify for any Stock Option an exercise price per share that is higher than the Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant.
Exercise Price
6.3 . The Committee shall in its discretion prescribe the time or times at which, or the conditions upon which, a Stock Option or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable, and may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Option at any time. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion.
Vesting of Stock Options
6.4 . The Committee shall in its discretion prescribe in an Award Agreement the period during which a vested Stock Option may be exercised, provided that the maximum term of a Stock Option shall be ten years from the Date of Grant. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, Section 13.2 or as otherwise may be provided by the Committee in an
Term of Stock Options
 
Award Agreement, no Stock Option may be exercised at any time during the term thereof unless the Participant is then in the Service of the Company or one of its Affiliates.
6.5 . Subject to Section 6.8 hereof with respect to Incentive Stock Options, the Stock Option of any Participant whose Service with the Company or one of its Affiliates is terminated for any reason shall terminate on the earlier of (A) the date that the Stock Option expires in accordance with its terms or (B) unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, and except for termination for cause (as described in Section 12.2 hereof), the expiration of the applicable time period following termination of Service, in accordance with the following: (1) twelve months if Service ceased due to Disability, (2) eighteen months if Service ceased at a time when the Participant is eligible to elect immediate commencement of retirement benefits at a specified retirement age under a pension plan to which the Company or any of its Affiliates had made contributions, (3) eighteen months if the Participant died while in the Service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (4) three months if Service ceased for any other reason. During the foregoing applicable period, except as otherwise specified in the Award Agreement or in the event Service was terminated by the death of the Participant, the Stock Option may be exercised by such Participant in respect of the same number of shares of Common Stock, in the same manner, and to the same extent as if he or she had remained in the continued Service of the Company or any Affiliate during the first three months of such period; provided that no additional rights shall vest after such three months. The Committee shall have authority to determine in each case whether an authorized leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of Service for purposes hereof, as well as the effect of a leave of absence on the vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if an entity ceases to be an Affiliate or otherwise ceases to be qualified under the Plan or if all or substantially all of the assets of an Affiliate are conveyed (other than by encumbrance), such cessation or action, as the case may be, shall be deemed for purposes hereof to be a termination of the Service.
Termination of Service
6.6 . Subject to such terms and conditions as shall be specified in an Award Agreement, a Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the term thereof by notice in the form required by the Company, together with payment of the aggregate exercise price therefor and applicable withholding tax. Payment of the exercise price shall be made in the manner set forth in the Award Agreement, unless otherwise provided by the Committee: (i) in cash or by cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, (ii) by payment in shares of Common Stock that have been held by the Participant for at least six months (or such period as the Committee may deem appropriate, for accounting purposes or otherwise) valued at the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date of exercise, (iii) through an open-market, broker-assisted sales transaction pursuant to which the Company is promptly delivered the amount of proceeds necessary to satisfy the exercise price, (iv) by a combination of the methods described above or (v) by such other method as may be approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. In addition to and at the time of payment of the exercise price, the Participant shall pay to the Company the full amount of any and all applicable income tax, employment tax and other amounts required to be withheld in connection with such exercise, payable under such of the methods described above for the payment of the exercise price as may be approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.
Stock Option Exercise; Tax Withholding
6.7 . All Stock Options shall be nontransferable except (i) upon the Participant's death, in accordance with Section 13.2 hereof or

The transfer of a Nonqualified Stock Option may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may in its discretion impose from time to time. Subsequent transfers of a Nonqualified Stock Option shall be prohibited other than in accordance with Section 13.2 hereof.
6.8 .
Additional Rules for Incentive Stock Options
(a) . An Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to an Eligible Person who is considered an employee for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.421-7(h) with respect to the Company or any Affiliate that qualifies as a "subsidiary corporation" with respect to the Company for purposes of Section 424(f) of the Code.
Eligibility
(b) . No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to a Participant as a result of which the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Date of Grant) of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code are exercisable for the first time in any calendar year under the Plan and any other stock option plans of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation, would exceed $100,000, determined in accordance with Section 422(d) of the Code. This limitation shall be applied by taking stock options into account in the order in which granted.
Annual Limits
(c) . An Award of an Incentive Stock Option may provide that such Stock Option may be exercised not later than 3 months following termination of employment of the Participant with the Company and all Subsidiaries, or not later than one year following a permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as and to the extent determined by the Committee to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.
Termination of Employment
(d) . Any Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as are deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee, which terms, together with the terms of the Plan, shall be intended and interpreted to cause such Incentive Stock Option to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. An Award Agreement for an Incentive Stock Option may provide that such Stock Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent that certain requirements applicable to "incentive stock options" under the Code shall not be satisfied. An Incentive Stock Option shall by its terms be nontransferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only by such Participant.
Other Terms and Conditions; Nontransferability

If shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of within two years following the Date of Grant or one year following the transfer of such shares to the Participant upon exercise, the Participant shall, promptly following such disposition, notify the Company in writing of
Disqualifying Dispositions
 
the date and terms of such disposition and provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Company may reasonably require.
6.9 . Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.3 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Option that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of such a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York Stock Exchange.
Repricing Prohibited
7. .
Stock Appreciation Rights
7.1 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted on a basis that allows for the exercise of the right by the Participant or that provides for the automatic payment of the right upon a specified date or event.
Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights
7.2 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted without any related Stock Option. The Committee shall in its discretion provide in an Award Agreement the time or times at which, or the conditions upon which, a Stock Appreciation Right or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable, and may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Appreciation Right at any time. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Appreciation Right may be based on the continued Service of a Participant with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified time period (or periods). on the attainment of a specified performance goal (or goals) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. A Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable or payable at such time or times as determined by the Committee, provided that the maximum term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be ten years from the Date of Grant. The base price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted without any related Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the base price per share of any such freestanding Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock on the Date of Grant.
Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights
7.3 . A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted in tandem with a Stock Option, either at the time of grant or at any time thereafter during the term of the Stock Option. A tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder to elect, as to all or any portion of the number of shares subject to the Award, to exercise either the Stock Option or the Stock Appreciation Right, resulting in the reduction of the corresponding number of shares subject to the right so exercised as well as the tandem right not so exercised. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option hereunder shall have a base price per share equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option, will be vested and exercisable at the same time or times that a related Stock Option is vested and exercisable, and will expire no later than the time at which the related Stock Option expires.
Tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Rights
7.4 . A Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder, upon exercise or other payment of the Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, to receive
Payment of Stock Appreciation Rights
 
an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise or payment of the Stock Appreciation Right over the base price of such Stock Appreciation Right, by (ii) the number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Right is exercised or paid. Subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, payment of the amount determined under the foregoing may be made, as approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, in shares of Common Stock valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or payment, in cash, or in a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements.
7.5 . Subject to the antidilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.3 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, neither the Committee nor the Board shall cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Appreciation Right that would have the effect of reducing the base price of such a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan, or otherwise approve any modification to such a Stock Appreciation Right that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the New York Stock Exchange.

Except to the extent an Award Agreement provides for a different result (in which case the Award Agreement will govern and this Section 11 of the Plan shall not be applicable), and except as may be limited by the provisions of Section 11.3 hereof, notwithstanding anything elsewhere in the Plan or any rules adopted by the Committee pursuant to the Plan to the contrary, if a Triggering Event shall occur within the 12-month period beginning with a Change in Control of the Company, then, effective immediately prior to such Triggering Event, (i) each outstanding Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right, to the extent that it shall not otherwise have become vested and exercisable, shall automatically become fully and immediately vested and exercisable, without regard to any otherwise applicable vesting requirement, (ii) each Restricted Stock Award shall become fully and immediately vested and all forfeiture and transfer restrictions thereon shall lapse, and (iii) each outstanding Stock Unit Award shall become immediately and fully vested and payable.

Definitions
(a) . For purposes of this Section 11, the term "Cause" shall mean a determination by the Committee that a Participant (i) has been convicted of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime that constitutes a felony under Federal or state law, (ii) has engaged in willful gross misconduct in the performance of the Participant's duties to the Company or an Affiliate or (iii) has committed a material breach of any written agreement with the Company or any Affiliate with respect to confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation or similar restrictive covenant. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11.1 hereof, in the event that a Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that defines a termination on account of "Cause" (or a term having similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of a termination on account of "Cause" for purposes hereof, but only to the extent that such definition provides the Participant with greater rights. A termination on account of Cause
Cause
 
shall be communicated by written notice to the Participant, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the Participant.
(b) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred upon:
Change in Control
(i) the occurrence of (A) an acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a percentage of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Company Voting Securities"), but excluding (1) any acquisition directly from the Company (other than an acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege of a security that was not acquired directly from the Company), (2) any acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate and (3) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate) (an "Acquisition") that is thirty percent (30%) or more of the Company Voting Securities; and (B) the termination of employment, within six (6) months following the Acquisition, of the individual who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company immediately prior to the Acquisition, for any reason other than death, Disability, Cause, or voluntary resignation (but excluding any termination that constitutes a Constructive Termination or any resignation that was requested by the Board or any such Person (or its employees or representatives) that completes an Acquisition);
(ii) at any time during a period of two (2) consecutive years or less, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board (and any new directors whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was so approved) cease for any reason (except for death, Disability or voluntary retirement) to constitute a majority thereof:
(iii) an Acquisition that is fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company Voting Securities;
(iv) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar corporate transaction, whether or not the Company is the surviving company in such transaction, other than a merger, consolidation, or reorganization that would result in the Persons who are beneficial owners of the Company Voting Securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportions, at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the Company Voting Securities (or the voting securities of the surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization;
 
(v) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;
(vi) the approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
(vii) the occurrence of any transaction or event, or series of transactions or events, designated by the Board in a duly adopted resolution as representing a change in the effective control of the business and affairs of the Company, effective as of the date specified in any such resolution.
(c) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Constructive Termination" shall mean a termination of employment by a Participant within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of any one or more of the following events without the Participant's written consent (i) any reduction in position, title (for Vice Presidents or above), overall responsibilities, level of authority, level of reporting (for Vice Presidents or above), base compensation, annual incentive compensation opportunity, aggregate employee benefits or (ii) a request that the Participant's location of employment be relocated by more than fifty (50) miles. Subject to the first sentence of Section 11.1 hereof, in the event that a Participant is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any Affiliate (or a successor entity) that defines a termination on account of "Constructive Termination," "Good Reason" or "Breach of Agreement" (or a term having a similar meaning), such definition shall apply as the definition of "Constructive Termination" for purposes hereof in lieu of the foregoing, but only to the extent that such definition provides the Participant with greater rights. A Constructive Termination shall be communicated by written notice to the Committee, and shall be deemed to occur on the date such notice is delivered to the Committee, unless the circumstances giving rise to the Constructive Termination are cured within five (5) days of such notice.
Constructive Termination
(d) . For purposes of this Section 11, a "Triggering Event" shall mean (i) the termination of Service of a Participant by the Company or an Affiliate (or any successor thereof) other than on account of death, Disability or Cause, (ii) the occurrence of a Constructive Termination or (iii) any failure by the Company (or a successor entity) to assume, replace, convert or otherwise continue any Award in connection with the Change in Control (or another corporate transaction or other change effecting the Common Stock) on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately prior to such transaction, except for equitable adjustments to reflect changes in the Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof.
Triggering Event
11.3 . In the event that the vesting of Awards together with all other payments and the value of any benefit received or to be received by a Participant would result in all or a portion of such payment being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Participant's payment shall be either (i) the full payment or (ii) such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payment being subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable Federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Participant, on an aftertax basis, of the greatest amount of the payment notwithstanding
Excise Tax Limit
 
that all or some portion of the payment may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. All determinations required to be made under this Section 11 shall be made by PricewaterhouseCoopers or any other nationally recognized accounting firm which is the Company's outside auditor immediately prior to the event triggering the payments that are subject to the Excise Tax (the "Accounting Firm"). The Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide detailed supporting calculations of its determinations to the Company and the Participant. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. The Accounting Firm's determinations must be made with substantial authority (within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code). For the purposes of all calculations under Section 280G of the Code and the application of this Section 11.3, all determinations as to present value shall be made using 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code) compounded semiannually , as in effect on December 30, 2004.
12. .
Forfeiture Events
12.1 . The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement at the time of the Award that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events shall include, but shall not be limited to, termination of Service for cause, violation of material Company policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company.
General
12.2 . Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement, if a Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate shall be terminated for cause, the Company may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate such Participant's right to any further payments, vesting or exercisability with respect to any Award in its entirety. In the event a Participant is party to an employment (or similar) agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that defines the term "cause," such definition shall apply for purposes of the Plan. The Company shall have the power to determine whether the Participant has been terminated for cause and the date upon which such termination for cause occurs. Any such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Participant. In addition, if the Company shall reasonably determine that a Participant has committed or may have committed any act which could constitute the basis for a termination of such Participant's employment for cause, the Company may suspend the Participant's rights to exercise any option, receive any payment or vest in any right with respect to any Award pending a determination by the Company of whether an act has been committed which could constitute the basis for a termination for "cause" as provided in this Section 12.2.
Termination for Cause
13. .
General Provisions
13.1 . To the extent deemed necessary by the Committee, an Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in a written or electronic form approved by the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock or units subject to the Award, the exercise price, base price, or purchase price of the Award, the time or times at which an Award will become vested, exercisable or payable and the term of the Award. The
Award Agreement
 
Award Agreement may also set forth the effect on an Award of termination of Service under certain circumstances. The Award Agreement shall be subject to and incorporate, by reference or otherwise, all of the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan, and may also set forth other terms and conditions applicable to the Award as determined by the Committee consistent with the limitations of the Plan. Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee need not require the execution of an Award Agreement by a Participant, in which case, acceptance of the Award by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the Participant to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as well as the administrative guidelines of the Company in effect from time to time.
13.2 . In the event of the death of a Participant while employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, an outstanding Award may be exercised by or shall become payable to the Participant's beneficiary as designated by the Participant in the manner prescribed by the Committee or, in the absence of an authorized beneficiary designation, by the a legatee or legatees of such Award under the participant's last will, or by such Participant's executors, personal representatives or distributees of such Award in accordance with the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution (a "Beneficiary"). In the case of Stock Options, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, any outstanding Stock Options of a Participant who dies while in Service may be exercised by such Beneficiary in respect of all or any part of the total number of shares subject to such options at the time of such Participant's death (whether or not, at the time of death, the deceased Participant would have been entitled to exercise such options to the extent of all or any of the shares covered thereby). However, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, in the event of the death of the Participant after the date of termination of Service while an Option remains outstanding, then such deceased Participant's Options shall expire in accordance with their terms at the same time they would have expired if such Participant had not died, and may be exercised prior to their expiration by a Beneficiary in respect to the same number of shares, in the same manner and to the same extent as if such Participant were then living. In the case of Awards other than Stock Options, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, any outstanding Awards of a Participant who dies while in Service shall become fully vested and, in the case of Stock Appreciation Rights, exercisable as provided above with respect to stock options, and in the case of all other types of Awards, payable to the Beneficiary promptly following the Participant's death.
Treatment of Awards upon Death
13.3 . Except as provided in Sections 6.7 and 13.2 hereof, Awards under the Plan shall not be assignable or transferable by the Participant, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall not be subject in any manner to assignment, alienation, pledge, encumbrance or charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide in the terms of an Award Agreement or in any other manner prescribed by the Committee that the Participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be entitled to any rights, payments or other benefits specified under an Award following
No Assignment or Transfer; Beneficiaries
 
the Participant's death. During the lifetime of a Participant, an Award shall be exercised only by such Participant or such Participant's guardian or legal representative.
13.4 . The Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to the Participant by virtue of the exercise of a right or the satisfaction of vesting or other conditions with respect to an Award. If any such deferral is to be permitted by the Committee, the Committee shall establish rules and procedures relating to such deferral in a manner intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, the time when an election to defer may be made, the time period of the deferral and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount, the interest or other earnings attributable to the deferral and the method of funding, if any, attributable to the deferred amount.
Deferrals of Payment
13.5 . Nothing in the Plan, in the grant of any Award or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Eligible Person or any Participant any right to continue in the Service of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service relationship of an Eligible employee or a Participant for any reason at any time.
Employment or Service
13.6 . A Participant shall have no rights as a holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to any unissued securities covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of such securities. Except as provided in Section 4.3 hereof, no adjustment or other provision shall be made for dividends or other shareholder rights, except to the extent that the Award Agreement provides for dividend payments or dividend equivalent rights. The Committee may determine in its discretion the manner of delivery of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan, which may be by delivery of stock certificates, electronic account entry into new or existing accounts or any other means as the Committee, in its discretion, deems appropriate. The Committee may require that the stock certificates be held in escrow by the Company for any shares of Common Stock or cause the shares to be legended in order to comply with the securities laws or other applicable restrictions, or should the shares of Common Stock be represented by book or electronic account entry rather than a certificate, the Committee may take such steps to restrict transfer of the shares of Common Stock as the Committee considers necessary or advisable.
Rights as Shareholder
13.7 . No shares of Common Stock will be issued or transferred pursuant to an Award unless and until all then applicable requirements imposed by Federal and state securities and other laws, rules and regulations and by any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, and by any exchanges upon which the shares of Common Stock may be listed, have been fully met. As a condition precedent to the issuance of shares pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Award, the Company may require the Participant to take any reasonable action to meet such requirements. The Committee may impose such conditions on any shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under the requirements of any exchange upon which such shares of the same class are then listed, and under any blue sky or other securities laws applicable to such shares. The Committee may also require the Participant to represent and warrant at the time of issuance or transfer that the shares of Common Stock are being acquired only for investment purposes and without any current intention to sell or distribute such shares.
Securities Laws
 
13.8 . The Participant shall be responsible for payment of any taxes or similar charges required by law to be paid or withheld from an Award or an amount paid in satisfaction of an Award. Any required withholdings shall be paid by the Participant on or prior to the payment or other event that results in taxable income in respect of an Award. The Award Agreement may specify the manner in which the withholding obligation shall be satisfied with respect to the particular type of Award.
Tax Withholding
13.9 . The adoption of the Plan and any reservation of shares of Common Stock or cash amounts by the Company to discharge its obligations hereunder shall not be deemed to create a trust or other funded arrangement. Except upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to an Award, any rights of a Participant under the Plan shall be those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company, and neither a Participant nor the Participant's permitted transferees or estate shall have any other interest in any assets of the Company by virtue of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to implement or set aside funds in a grantor trust, subject to the claims of the Company's creditors or otherwise, to discharge its obligations under the Plan.
Unfunded Plan
13.10 . The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other share incentive or other compensation plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company from establishing any other forms of share incentive or other compensation or benefit program for employees of the Company or any Affiliate. The amount of any compensation deemed to be received by a Participant pursuant to an Award shall not constitute includable compensation for purposes of determining the amount of benefits to which a Participant is entitled under any other compensation or benefit plan or program of the Company or an Affiliate, including, without limitation, under any pension or severance benefits plan, except to the extent specifically provided by the terms of any such plan.
Other Compensation and Benefit Plans
13.11 . The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its transferees and assigns, and the Participant, the Participant's executor, administrator and permitted transferees and beneficiaries.
Plan Binding on Transferees
13.12 . If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.
Severability
13.13 . The Committee may adopt, amend and terminate such arrangements and grant such Awards, not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan, as it may deem necessary or desirable to comply with any tax, securities, regulatory or other laws of other jurisdictions with respect to Awards that may be subject to such laws. The terms and conditions of such Awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the Plan solely to the extent the Committee deems necessary for such purpose. Moreover, the Board may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of the Plan, not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan, as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of the Plan as in effect for any other purpose.
Foreign Jurisdictions
 
13.14 . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Committee to grant Awards under the Plan in connection with the acquisition, whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction, of the business or assets of any corporation or other entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may grant Awards under the Plan to an employee or director of another corporation who becomes an Eligible Person by reason of any such corporate transaction in substitution for awards previously granted by such corporation or entity to such person. The terms and conditions of the substitute Awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the Plan solely to the extent the Committee deems necessary for such purpose.
Substitute Awards in Corporate Transactions
13.15 . For purposes of Restricted Stock Awards, Stock Unit Awards and Stock Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, such Awards shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Company's 2002 Executive Performance Plan (or any successor plan) to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Coordination with 2002 Executive Performance Plan
13.16 . To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and all Awards hereunder comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and all Award Agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement is determined by the Committee to not comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such changes to the Plan or an Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary to comply with such requirements, provided that no such action shall adversely affect any outstanding Award without the consent of the affected Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code at the time of termination of Service with respect to an Award, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of any payments or benefits under the Award shall be deferred until the date that is six months following the Participant's termination of Service (or such other period as required to comply with Section 409A).
Section 409A Compliance
13.17 . The Plan and all rights hereunder shall be subject to and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the principles of conflicts of laws, and to applicable Federal securities laws.
Governing Law
14. .

No amendment or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award theretofore granted without the consent of the Participant or the permitted transferee of the Award.
14.3 . The Plan shall terminate on December 30, 2011, which is the seventh anniversary of the date of its adoption by the Board. The Board may, in its discretion and at any earlier date, terminate the Plan.
