Item 3.02   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On March 14, 2008, the Registrant called for redemption on April 15, 2008 (the "Redemption Date") all of its outstanding 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Notes") at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date. As of the date of the call for redemption, $1,322,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes was outstanding.
Upon call for redemption, each $1,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes was convertible, at the option of the holders, into 33.9443 shares of the Registrant's Common Stock. As of April 11, 2008, $1,319,904,475 aggregate principal amount of the Notes had been surrendered for conversion into a total amount of 44,802,988 shares of the Registrant's Common Stock. In addition to the shares issued in respect of the principal amount of Notes converted, cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares. The remaining $2,595,525 aggregate principal amount of Notes was redeemed for cash on April 15, 2008.
Set forth below is a chart that shows all conversions of the Notes:
 
 
 
The shares of the Registrant's Common Stock were issued solely to former holders of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes pursuant to the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This exemption is available to the Registrant because the shares of the Registrant's Common Stock were exchanged by the Registrant with its existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remunerations was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such an exchange.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
