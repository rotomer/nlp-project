Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. As Representatives of the several Underwriters
 
Gentlemen:
 
I am Senior Vice President-Deputy General Counsel-Corporate of The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation ("Disney"), and have acted as such in connection with the issuance and sale by Disney of Medium-Term Notes, Series D, entitled 5.50% Global Notes due 2019 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Terms Agreement, dated March 11, 2009 (the "Terms Agreement"), between Disney and each of the underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"), for whom Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. are acting as representatives (the "Representatives").
 
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to the Terms Agreement.
 
In connection with this letter, I have examined and am familiar with originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for this letter, including (a) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-148043), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on December 13, 2007 (such Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act (the "Incorporated Documents")) being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Registration Statement"), pertaining to Disney's debt securities and other securities, (b) the Prospectus, dated December 13, 2007, and the accompanying Prospectus Supplement, dated December 13, 2007 and Pricing Supplement, dated March 11, 2009, relating to the Notes, each of which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (such Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents), Prospectus Supplement and Pricing Supplement being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Prospectus"), (c) executed copy of the Terms Agreement and (d) the Pricing Term Sheet attached as Schedule II to the Terms Agreement ("Term Sheet").
 
I have made such inquiry of such officers of Disney and its subsidiaries and counsel for Disney and examined such corporate records, certificates of officers of Disney, officers of Disney's subsidiaries and of public officials and such other documents and such questions of law and fact as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this letter.  In connection with my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus and the Term Sheet, I have not verified, independently, nor do I pass upon or assume any responsibility for, explicitly or implicitly, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained therein.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to my attention that leads me to believe that (a) the Registration Statement at the time such Registration Statement became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility and Qualification on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  As used in this paragraph, "Pricing Disclosure Package" means the base Prospectus dated as of December 13, 2007, and the accompanying Prospectus Supplement dated as of December 13, 2007 together with the Term Sheet.
 
This letter is rendered to you, in your capacity as Underwriters, in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes, and this letter may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to or relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my prior express written permission.

Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date, as specified in the Pricing Supplement (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of principal of and interest on this Note may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth below, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or its duly appointed co-authenticating agent by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture. This Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series D. The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
 
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
This Note may not be redeemed prior to the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above. If no Earliest Redemption Date is so set forth, this Note is not redeemable prior to the Maturity Date.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates referred to above, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
The Redemption Price shall be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or (2) as determined by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 37.5 basis points.  The Redemption Price will be calculated assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. For purposes of calculating the Redemption Price, the terms below shall have the following meanings:
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of those Notes.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker, from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment and banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means: (i) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and  J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors; provided that, if any such firm ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City ("Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) up to two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding that Redemption Date.
 
the Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder of hereof who is a United States Alien, as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on this Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on such this Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in this Note to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.  If fewer than all of the Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Interest Rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such Notes for redemption will be made by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Notes so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
.
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.50 % Global Notes Due 2019 (the "Notes"), pursuant to the pricing supplement dated March 11, 2009 supplementing (i) the prospectus supplement dated December 13, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and (ii) the prospectus dated December 13, 2007 (the "Base Prospectus") that forms part of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-148043) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by the Company (the "Registration Statement").  As used in this letter, the term "Prospectus" means, collectively, the Pricing Supplement, Prospectus Supplement and Base Prospectus.  The Notes are to be issued under a Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
500,000,000
We have acted as counsel to The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of $
 
, 2009 among the Company and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Representatives of the Underwriters named therein, (vi) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended and currently in effect, (vii) the Bylaws of the Company as currently in effect, (viii) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to, among other things, the Registration Statement and the securities to be sold thereunder (the "Board Resolutions"), and (ix) officers' certificates executed by duly authorized officers of the Company establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Board Resolutions.  We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
11
We have examined (i) the Prospectus, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the Indenture, (iv) the form of the Notes, (v) the executed Terms Agreement dated as of March 
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, or as retrieved from the SEC's IDEA database, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of
 
the Trustee.  In making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all their obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which were not independently established or verified by us, we have, with your consent, relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
 
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
 
The Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms when the Notes shall have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture and the Board Resolutions and shall have been duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor.
 
The foregoing opinion as to enforceability of obligations of the Company is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such principles, a court may include a covenant of good faith and fair dealing and apply concepts of reasonableness and materiality).
 
Members of our firm are admitted to the Bar in the State of New York and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as in effect on the date hereof.  We disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement, and to all references to our firm included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the related rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
