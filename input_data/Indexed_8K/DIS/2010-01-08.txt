(e) The Company has entered into a new employment agreement with James A. Rasulo and amended its employment agreement with Thomas O. Staggs.
. The new employment agreement for Mr. Rasulo (the "Rasulo Agreement") was entered into on January 4, 2010, is effective as of January 1, 2010 and has a stated term through January 31, 2015. Under the Rasulo Agreement, Mr. Rasulo will serve as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
Rasulo Agreement
The agreement provides that Mr. Rasulo will receive an annual salary of $1,400,000, commencing January 1, 2010, and that for each year thereafter the annual salary for Mr. Rasulo will be determined by the Company in its sole discretion but shall not be less than $1,400,000. The Rasulo Agreement provides that Mr. Rasulo is also eligible for an annual, performance-based bonus under the Company's applicable annual incentive plan (currently, the Company's Management Incentive Bonus Program) and that the Compensation Committee will set a target bonus each year of 200% of the annual base salary that is expected to be in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal year. The actual amount payable to Mr. Rasulo as an annual bonus will be dependent upon the achievement of performance objectives, which will be substantially the same as the objectives established under the plan for other senior executive officers of the Company. Depending on performance, the actual amount payable as an annual bonus to Mr. Rasulo may be less than, greater than or equal to the stated target bonus (and could be zero).
The Rasulo Agreement also provides that Mr. Rasulo is entitled to participate in the Company's equity-based long-term incentive plans and programs generally made available to senior executive officers of the Company and that for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement, Mr. Rasulo will be granted a long-term incentive award having a target value equal to 300% of his expected fiscal year-end annual base salary; provided, however, that the Compensation Committee may adjust (i.e. reduce) the target award value of any award made in respect of any fiscal year based on its evaluation of Mr. Rasulo's performance and/or any economic, financial and/or market conditions affecting the Company and/or any of its affiliated entities. The Compensation Committee may also increase the award value of any equity-based long-term incentive award based on its evaluation of Mr. Rasulo's performance. These awards will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting and performance conditions) as will be established for other senior executives of the Company in accordance with the Board's policies for the grant of equity-based awards, as in effect at the time of the award, and do not guarantee Mr. Rasulo any minimum amount of compensation. The actual amounts payable to Mr. Rasulo in respect of such opportunities will be determined based on the extent to which any performance conditions and/or service conditions applicable to such awards are satisfied and on the value of the Company's stock. Accordingly, Mr. Rasulo may receive compensation in respect of any such award that is greater or less than the stated target value, depending on whether, and to what extent, the applicable performance and other conditions are satisfied and on the value of the Company's stock.
 
Under the Rasulo Agreement, Mr. Rasulo is entitled to participate in employee benefits and perquisites generally made available to senior executives of the Company (other than the Company's Family Income Assurance Plan).
Mr. Rasulo's employment may be terminated by the Company for "cause," which is defined to include gross negligence, gross misconduct, willful nonfeasance or a willful material breach of the Rasulo Agreement.
Mr. Rasulo has the right to terminate his employment for "good reason," which is defined as (i) a reduction in any of his base salary, annual target bonus opportunity or annual target long-term incentive award opportunity; (ii) his removal from the position of Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; (iii) a material reduction in his duties and responsibilities; (iv) the assignment to him of duties that are materially inconsistent with his position or duties or that materially impair his ability to function as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and any other position in which he is then serving; (vi) relocation of his principal office to a location that is more than 50 miles outside of the greater Los Angeles area; or (vii) a material breach of any material provision of the agreement by the Company. Following a change in control of the Company, as defined in the Company's 2005 Stock Plan, good reason also includes any event that is a triggering event as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan. A triggering event is defined to include a termination of employment by the Company other than for "cause" or a termination of employment by the participant following a reduction in position, pay or other "constructive termination."
In the event that Mr. Rasulo's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by him for "good reason", he will be entitled to termination benefits, which include the following: (i) a lump sum payment of the base salary that would have been payable over the remaining term of the Rasulo Agreement, (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (any prior-year bonus not yet paid at the time of termination is also paid), and (iii) his outstanding unvested stock options and outstanding unvested restricted stock unit awards that could vest in accordance with their scheduled vesting provisions if Mr. Rasulo's employment had continued through the remaining term of the agreement will be eligible to vest at the same time and subject to the same performance conditions as though Mr. Rasulo continued in the Company's employ, and all stock options, whether vested on date of termination or vesting thereafter as described above, shall vest and remain exercisable to the same extent as if Mr. Rasulo's employment had continued through the term of the agreement. However, the Rasulo Agreement provides that, unless necessary to preserve the tax deductibility of the compensation payable in respect of restricted stock units, the Company will waive any performance conditions related to performance in future fiscal years that were imposed primarily to permit the Company to claim a tax deduction for the compensation payable in respect of such units.
To qualify for the foregoing cash severance benefit, pro-rated bonus (and prior-year bonus, if not already paid), opportunity to vest in unvested equity awards available under the Rasulo Agreement and extended exercisability of stock options following an involuntary termination by the Company without cause, or a termination by Mr. Rasulo for good reason, Mr. Rasulo must execute a release in favor of the Company and agree to provide the Company with certain consulting services for a period of six months after his termination (or, if less, for the remaining term of the Rasulo Agreement). Additionally, during the period of these consulting services,
 
Mr. Rasulo must also agree not to provide any services to entities that compete with any of the Company's business segments.
If any payments to Mr. Rasulo would be subject to excise tax as a result of payments received upon termination following a change in control of the Company under federal income tax rules, the Company has agreed to pay him an additional amount to compensate for the incremental tax costs of such payments, provided that the maximum additional compensation payable to Mr. Rasulo for this purpose will not exceed $2,000,000.
The Rasulo Agreement contains covenants for the benefit of the Company relating to non-competition during the term of employment, protection of the Company's confidential information, and non-solicitation of Company employees for one year following termination of his employment for any reason.
The amendment of Mr. Staggs' employment agreement was entered into on January 7, 2010. Pursuant to the amendment, Mr. Staggs relinquished his position as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective as of January 1, 2010, and assumed the position of Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide.
Amendment of Staggs Agreement.
The amendment also provides that Mr. Staggs will continue to have the opportunity to earn an annual incentive bonus in accordance with the annual bonus plan of the Company as then generally applicable to the Company's executive officers for fiscal 2010, and thereafter his opportunity to earn an annual incentive bonus will be in accordance with the bonus plan as then generally applicable to the most senior executives of the subsidiaries of the Company who have levels of responsibility comparable to that of Mr. Staggs. With regard to the Company's equity-based long-term incentive program, Mr. Staggs will be entitled to participate in such program on substantially the same terms and conditions as generally apply to the most senior executives of the subsidiaries of the Company who have comparable levels of responsibility.
Mr. Staggs continues to be eligible for benefits generally made available to the senior executive officers of the Company to the same extent as if he had remained Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, except to the extent that doing so would result in non-compliance with ERISA rules or regulations or federal, state or local laws or the requirements for eligibility for tax-qualified status of any plan or program of the Company.
In connection with the amendment, Mr. Staggs' employment agreement was assigned as of January 1, 2010, to Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Except as modified by the amendment, all of the terms and provisions of Mr. Staggs' employment agreement (including, without limitation, the term of the Agreement, the amount of his base salary and the specified minimum target annual incentive bonus opportunity and minimum target award value for long-term equity-based awards, in each case as provided in his employment agreement prior to the amendment) remain in full force and effect.
 
The agreement of Mr. Rasulo and the amendment of Mr. Staggs' agreement are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 respectively to this Report and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Termination Right
(f) As permitted under the terms of the applicable Plans, the Company and Executive agree that the definitions of Termination for Cause or Termination for Good Reason set forth in this Paragraph 5 shall apply in place of any similar definition or comparable concept applicable under either of the Plans (or any similar definition in any successor plan), except that, in connection with a "Triggering Event" as defined in the Plans, as such Plans may be amended from time to time, the terms of the applicable plan (and not the definitions of Termination for Cause or Termination for Good Reason set forth in this Paragraph 5) shall apply to determine Executive's rights and entitlements in respect of the awards made under any such plan (and only in respect of such awards).
Conflict With Plans.
(g) . To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the requirements of Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with this intent. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, any payment required to be made to Executive hereunder upon his termination of employment (including any payment to this Paragraph 5) shall be made promptly after the six month anniversary of Executive's date of termination to the extent necessary to avoid imposition on Executive of any tax penalty imposed under Section 409A of the Code. Solely for purposes of determining the time and form of payments due Executive under this Agreement (including any payments due under Paragraphs 3(a) or 7) or otherwise in connection with his termination of employment with the Company, Executive shall not be deemed to have incurred a termination of employment unless and until he shall incur a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.

The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with this subparagraph and in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). To the extent that the Company and Executive determine that any provision of this Agreement could reasonably be expected to result in Executive's being subject to the payment of interest or additional tax under Section 409A, the Company and Executive agree, to the extent reasonably possible as determined in good faith, to amend this Agreement, retroactively, if necessary, in order to avoid the imposition of any such interest or additional tax under Section 409A.

Section 409A
 
requirements of Section 409A to the extent that such reimbursements or in-kind benefits are subject to Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to set off or liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.

Amendment of Existing Agreements
6. . Executive shall be under no obligation to seek other employment or other engagement of his services. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the payments and rights provided under Paragraph 5 are fair and reasonable, and are Executive's sole and exclusive remedy, in lieu of all other remedies at law or in equity, for termination of his employment by the Company upon exercise of its Termination Right pursuant to this Agreement or upon a Termination for Good Reason. The failure of Executive to execute and timely deliver the Release and, if applicable, the Consulting Agreement for any reason () shall limit his rights in connection with the exercise by the Company of its Termination Right solely to the right to receive the Unconditional Entitlements, () shall not effect a modification of any of his commitments set forth in this Agreement (none of which are contingent upon execution of the Release by him) and () shall not preserve or revive any rights waived by Executive hereunder. Subject to Executive's execution and delivery of the Release without revocation thereof and execution and delivery of the Consulting Agreement, (i) the Company agrees to enter into the Release and (ii) there shall be no offset available to the Company against any amounts due, paid or payable to him in respect of the Conditional Benefits under Paragraph 5 with respect to any compensation, remuneration or payment attributable to any services that Executive may provide to any third party subsequent to termination of employment hereunder, whether as an employee or otherwise.

Additional Payments Following a Change in Control
Aggregate Payment
Excise Tax
 
respect to such Aggregate Payment, an additional amount which, after the imposition of all income and excise taxes and interest and penalties thereon, is equal to the Excise Tax on the Aggregate Payment. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (i) if the Aggregate Payments are less than 110% of the product of () three (3) times () Executive's Base Amount (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code), the Company shall have no obligation to make any additional payments under this Paragraph 7 and the Aggregate Payments to Executive shall be reduced such that no amount payable to Executive shall be subject to the Excise Tax, and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of payments made to Executive under this Paragraph 7 exceed $2,000,000. Solely to the extent that the Executive is better off on an after-tax basis as a result of the reduction of Aggregate Payments, such payments and benefits shall be reduced or eliminated, as determined by the Company, in the following order: (i) any cash payments, (ii) any taxable benefits, (iii) any nontaxable benefits, and (iv) any vesting or accelerated delivery of equity awards, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicable Excise Tax. The determination of whether the Aggregate Payment constitutes a Parachute Payment and, if so, the amount to be paid to the Executive and the time of payment pursuant to this Paragraph 7 shall be made by an independent accounting firm (the "") selected by the Company prior to the Change in Control. The Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized United States public accounting firm which has not, during the two years preceding the date of its selection, acted in any way on behalf of () the Company or any affiliate thereof or () Executive. In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accounting Firm or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the payment is made under this Paragraph 7 (including, but not limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of such payment), the Company shall make an additional payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accounting Firm or pursuant to any proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating the payment to be made pursuant to this Paragraph 7, Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of such prior payment that would not have been paid if such Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating such payment, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the payment made hereunder that is to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed interest received or credited to Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion. Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is denied.

If there has been no determination by the Reviewing Party or if the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in any court in the States of California or Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, or the legal or factual bases therefor and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
3. . The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then Independent Legal Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Independent Legal Counsel shall determine whether the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events. Such Independent Legal Counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee will be permitted to be indemnified. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel and to indemnify fully such Independent Legal Counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of Independent Legal Counsel pursuant hereto.
Change in Control
4. . In the event of a Potential Change in Control, the Company shall, upon written request by Indemnitee, create a trust for the benefit of Indemnitee and from time to time upon written request of Indemnitee shall fund such trust in an amount sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the time of each such request to be incurred in connection with investigating, preparing for and defending any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and all Claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be paid. The amount or amounts to be deposited in the trust pursuant to the foregoing funding obligation shall be determined by the Reviewing Party, in any case in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above is involved. The terms of the trust shall provide that upon a Change in Control (i) the trust shall not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of Indemnitee, (ii) the trustee shall advance, within two business days of a request by
Establishment of Trust

The trustee shall be chosen by Indemnitee. Nothing in this Section 4 shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement. All income earned on the assets held in the trust shall be reported as income by the Company for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes.
5. . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business days of such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
6. . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith. In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
Partial Indemnity, Etc
7. . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of , or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.
No Presumption
nolo contendere
 
8. . The rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or one of its subsidiaries or the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise. To the extent that a change in the Delaware General Corporation Law (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
Non-exclusivity, Etc
9. . Nothing contained in this Indemnity Agreement shall be construed as giving Indemnitee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt that the foregoing does not limit or otherwise affect the validity of any employment agreement or the enforceability thereof in accordance with its terms.
No Construction as Employment Agreement
10. . To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any director or officer of the Company.
Liability Insurance
11. . No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company or any affiliate of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors, administrators or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company or its affiliate shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action such shorter period shall govern.
Period of Limitations
12. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
Amendments, Etc.
13. . In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all required papers consistent herewith and shall take all reasonable and necessary actions to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents reasonably necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Subrogation
14. . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
No Duplication of Payments
 
15. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as an officer and/or director of any subsidiary of Company or of any other enterprise at the Company's request.
Binding Effect, Etc.
16. . The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Furthermore, to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of this Agreement containing any provision held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, void or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
Severability

Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release, acquittal and discharge of the Executive Releasees with respect to the Company Claims only, the Company expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all the Company Claims that the Company does not know or suspect to exist in the Company's favor at the time of execution hereof, and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of any such Company Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Release to the contrary, if at any time (whether during or after the Employment Period) the Company is required to restate its financial results due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws, nothing in this Release shall be construed to limit the rights of the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company to seek or obtain recovery from Executive of any incentive compensation (including profits realized from the sale of Company securities) previously paid, or the cancellation of any outstanding awards, in accordance with the terms of the Company's policy, as in effect from time to time, regarding the ability of the Company to recoup any bonus or incentive payments under such circumstances.
9. Executive understands that Executive has been given a period of 21 days to review and consider this Agreement before signing it pursuant to the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, as amended. Executive further understands that Executive may use as much of this 21-day period as Executive wishes prior to signing.
10. Executive acknowledges and represents that he understands that he may revoke the waiver of his rights under the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, as amended, effectuated in this Agreement within 7 days of signing this Agreement. Revocation can be made by delivering a written notice of revocation to the Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company, 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, California 91521; with a copy to the Company's Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer at the same address. For this revocation to be effective, written notice must be received by, the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, no later than the close of business on the seventh day after Executive signs this Agreement. If Executive revokes the waiver of his rights under the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the Company shall have no obligations to Executive hereunder, and this Agreement and the Employment Agreement shall have no further force and effect.
 
11. Executive and the Company respectively represent and acknowledge that in executing this Agreement neither of them is relying upon, and has not relied upon, any representation or statement not set forth herein made by any of the agents, representatives or attorneys of the Releasees or of the Executive Releasees with regard to the subject matter, basis or effect of this Agreement or otherwise.
12. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by any of the Company Releasees or Executive Releasees, respectively, that any the Company Releasee or Executive Releasee has acted wrongfully or that the Company or Executive has any rights whatsoever against any of the Company Releasees or Executive Releasees except as specifically set forth herein, and each of the Company Releasees and Executive Releasees specifically disclaims any liability to any party for any wrongful acts.
13. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California. This Agreement is binding on the successors and assigns of, and sets forth the entire agreement between, the parties hereto; fully supersedes any and all prior agreements or understandings between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof; and may not be changed except by explicit written agreement to that effect subscribed by the parties hereto.

.
 
depending on performance, the actual amount payable as an annual bonus to Executive under the Annual Plan may be less than, greater than or equal to the target bonus specified above. Any bonus payable pursuant to this Paragraph 3(b) shall be paid at the same time as annual bonuses are payable, for fiscal 2010, to Disney's executive officers, and, for fiscal 2011 and thereafter, to the most senior executives of the Disney Group in accordance with the provisions of the Annual Plan, subject to Executive's continued employment with the Company or an affiliate thereof through the date on which such bonuses are paid.

The preceding sentence shall not limit any power or discretion of the Board or the Committee in the administration of any such long-term incentive plan. The Compensation Committee may increase the award value of any award made in respect of any such fiscal year based on its evaluation of Executive's performance. The actual benefits conveyed to Executive in respect of any such awards may be less than, greater than or equal to the targeted award value, as such benefits will be dependent on a series of performance and other factors, such as the value of Disney's common stock and satisfaction of any applicable vesting requirements and performance conditions.

(D) to the extent that, under Disney's compensation practices and policies, any tranche of Remaining Stock Units is subject to the achievement of performance conditions which were imposed solely because Executive was an executive officer of Disney who could have been a covered employee within the meaning of Section 162(m) at the time payment in respect of such award was expected to be made (the "") and such Applicable 162(m) Criteria relate, in whole or in part, to any performance period continuing after the end of Disney's fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, such Applicable 162(m) Criteria shall be waived as of the Termination Date with respect to such tranche of the Remaining Stock Units; provided, however, that this Paragraph 5(d)(iii)(D) shall not be applicable if and to the extent, in the reasonable opinion of tax counsel to Disney, the presence of such provision would cause any stock units intended to be qualified as other performance based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code to fail to be so qualified at any time prior to Executive's Termination Date.
