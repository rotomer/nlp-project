Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On February 22, 2010, the Registrant entered into a new $2.25 billion Three-Year Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders to support commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. This new facility will expire in February 2013 and replaces the Registrant's $2.25 billion Amended and Restated Four Year Credit Agreement (filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Registrant's Form 8-K dated March 31, 2006), which expired on February 22, 2010. Under the new facility, the Registrant has the option to borrow at LIBOR-based rates plus a spread, subject to a cap and a floor that vary with the Registrant's debt rating, depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the Registrant's senior, unsecured, non-credit-enhanced long-term debt. The former facility's borrowing rate depended upon the Registrant's senior unsecured debt rating. The remaining provisions of the new facility, including representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, are substantially similar to the provisions of the former facility. In particular, the new facility contains only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, and specifically excludes certain entities, including Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
A copy of the new Three-Year Credit Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Unless the Designated Agent shall have received notice from a Lender on or prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Designated Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Designated Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Designated Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Designated Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
 
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have made such ratable portion available to the Designated Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Designated Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is paid to the Designated Agent, at (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Designated Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies; that (i) within two Business Days after any Lender shall fail to make such ratable portion available to the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent shall notify the Borrower of such failure and (ii) if such Lender shall not have paid such corresponding amount to the Designated Agent within two Business Days after such demand is made of such Lender by the Designated Agent, the Borrower agrees to repay to the Designated Agent forthwith upon demand by the Designated Agent to the Borrower such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Designated Agent, at the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing.

A certificate of such Lender as to such amount in reasonable detail and stating the basis upon which such amount has been calculated and certifying that such Lender's method of allocating such increase of capital is fair and reasonable and that such Lender's demand for payment of such increase of capital hereunder is not inconsistent with its treatment of other borrowers which, as a credit matter, are substantially similar to the Borrower and which are subject to similar provisions, submitted to the Borrower and the Designated Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes hereof, absent manifest error.
(c) The Borrower shall not be obligated to pay under this Section 2.11 any amounts which relate to costs or increases of capital incurred prior to the 12 months immediately preceding the date of demand for payment of such amounts by any Lender, unless the applicable law, regulation, guideline or request resulting in such costs or increases of capital is imposed retroactively.

amount under this Section 2.11 shall notify the Borrower not later than 12 months from the date that such Lender should reasonably have known of such law, regulation, guideline or request and the Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender for such amount is contingent upon such Lender so notifying the Borrower; that any failure by such Lender to provide such notice shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Section 2.11 with respect to amounts resulting from costs or increases of capital incurred after the date which occurs 12 months immediately preceding the date on which such Lender notified the Borrower of such law, regulation, guideline or request.
provided, however,

(at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency) on the day when due, in such Committed Currency to the Designated Agent, by deposit of such funds to the Designated Agent's Account in same day funds. The Designated Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.07, 2.11, 2.14, 8.04 and 8.08) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.19 or an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.20, and upon the Designated Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date or Extension Date, the Designated Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Designated Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes, if any, issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

Each determination by the Designated Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.07, by a Lender) of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes hereof, absent manifest error.
(c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes, if any, shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

(d) Unless the Designated Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Designated Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Designated Agent on such date and the Designated Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to the Designated Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Designated Agent, forthwith on demand, such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Designated Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Designated Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.
