(a)           if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the respective proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b)           if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased hereunder, this Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this provision shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Terms Agreement, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Original Issue Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the pricing supplement dated November 27, 2012 relating to the Notes or in any other documents or arrangements.

thereunder, the Company shall not have any responsibility for, and each Underwriter severally agrees with the Company that such Underwriter and its respective affiliates will obtain, any consent, approval or authorization required by them for the subscription, offer, sale or delivery by them of any of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any foreign jurisdiction to which they are subject or in or from which they make such subscription, offer, sale or delivery of any of the Notes.

As Representatives of the several Underwriters
 
Gentlemen:
 
I am Associate General Counsel of The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation ("Disney"), and have acted as such in connection with the issuance and sale by Disney of Medium-Term Notes, Series E, entitled 0.450% Global Notes Due 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), 1.100% Global Notes Due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), 2.350% Global Notes Due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and the 3.700% Global Notes Due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes, 2017 Notes and 2022 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to the Terms Agreement, dated November 27, 2012 (the "Terms Agreement"), between Disney and each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters").
 
This letter is being furnished to you pursuant to the Terms Agreement.
 
In connection with this letter, I have examined and am familiar with originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for this letter, including (a) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-171048), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on December 8, 2010 (such Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as defined below) pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Incorporated Documents")) being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Registration Statement"), pertaining to Disney's debt securities and other securities, (b) the Prospectus, dated December 8, 2010 (the "Base Prospectus"), the accompanying Prospectus Supplement, dated December 8, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the Pricing Supplement, dated November 27, 2012 (the "Pricing Supplement"), relating to the Notes, each of which was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (such Base Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents), Prospectus Supplement and Pricing Supplement being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Prospectus"), (c) an executed copy of the Terms Agreement and (d) the Pricing Term Sheet dated November 27, 2012 filed with the Commission as a free writing prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Term Sheet").
 
 
I have made such inquiry of such officers of Disney and its subsidiaries and counsel for Disney and examined such corporate records, certificates of officers of Disney, officers of Disney's subsidiaries and of public officials and such other documents and such questions of law and fact as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this letter.  In connection with my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus and the Term Sheet, I have not verified, independently, nor do I pass upon or assume any responsibility for, explicitly or implicitly, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained therein.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, nothing has come to my attention that leads me to believe that (a) the Registration Statement at the time such Registration Statement became effective contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time specified in the Terms Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, I express no opinion with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  As used in this paragraph, "Pricing Disclosure Package" means the Base Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) and the accompanying Prospectus Supplement, together with the Term Sheet.
 
This letter is rendered to you and the Underwriters, in their capacity as Underwriters, in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes, and this letter may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to or relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person without my prior express written permission.

as Trustee
 
 
THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date specified above to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears, in each year, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date, at the Interest Rate per annum set forth above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment; , that if the Original Issue Date of this Note is between a Regular Record Date specified above and the related Interest Payment Date, the first payment of interest on this Note will be made on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered Holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date set forth above (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of interest on this Note (other than at Maturity) may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to) issued and to be issued pursuant to such Indenture. This
Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series E (the "Notes"). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
 
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor and terms of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes") having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
This Note may not be redeemed prior to the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above. If no Earliest Redemption Date is so set forth, this Note is not redeemable prior to the Maturity Date. This Note is redeemable at any time on or after the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the registered Holder hereof, at the Redemption Price set forth in the next succeeding paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Note is subject to the payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, then this Note may be redeemed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below regarding Additional Amounts.
 
This Note may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time prior to Stated Maturity, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts:
 
(1)
                                
100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed; or
 
(2)
                                
as determined by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on this Note to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date) discounted to such Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 5 basis points,
 
plus, in the case of both clauses (1) and (2) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of this Note being redeemed to such Redemption Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to a Redemption Date for this Note will be payable to the Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.  The following terms have the meanings set forth below:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.  As used in the preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" below, the term "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Note.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, (i) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains six Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that Redemption Date, the average of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than six such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations, or (iii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation, such quotation.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for this Note, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding that Redemption Date.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, interest on this Note or portion hereof called for redemption will cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption Date.
 
In the event that this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, all payments of principal and interest with respect to this Note will be made without withholding or deduction at the source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required by (i) the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or (ii) an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such laws, regulations or rulings (including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in the United States or any political subdivision thereof).
If a withholding or deduction at source is required, in the event this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, the Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder hereof who is a United States Alien (as defined below), as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on this Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on this Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in this Note to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

As used in this Note, "United States Alien" means any Person that, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States Federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, "United States" means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction and "Code" means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, this Note and all other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note and all Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem such Notes pursuant to their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for
redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor and terms, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).

Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date set forth above (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of interest on this Note (other than at Maturity) may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.

Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series E (the "Notes"). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
 
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor and terms of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes") having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
This Note may not be redeemed prior to the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above. If no Earliest Redemption Date is so set forth, this Note is not redeemable prior to the Maturity Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Note is subject to the payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, then this Note may be redeemed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below regarding Additional Amounts.

plus, in the case of both clauses (1) and (2) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of this Note being redeemed to such Redemption Date.

The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.  As used in the preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" below, the term "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, (i) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains six Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that Redemption Date, the average of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than six such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations, or (iii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation, such quotation.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

As used in this Note, "United States Alien" means any Person that, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States Federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, "United States" means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction and "Code" means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, this Note and all other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note and all Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem such Notes pursuant to their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for
redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor and terms, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).

Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date set forth above (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of interest on this Note (other than at Maturity) may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.

Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series E (the "Notes"). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.

The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor and terms of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes") having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, (i) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains six Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that Redemption Date, the average of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than six such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations, or (iii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation, such quotation.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for this Note, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding that Redemption Date.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, interest on this Note or portion hereof called for redemption will cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption Date.
 
In the event that this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, all payments of principal and interest with respect to this Note will be made without withholding or deduction at the source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required by (i) the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or (ii) an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such laws, regulations or rulings (including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in the United States or any political subdivision thereof).
If a withholding or deduction at source is required, in the event this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, the Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder hereof who is a United States Alien (as defined below), as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on this Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on this Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in this Note to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to a payment on this Note to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts (or payment of Additional Amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of this Note.  As used in this Note, "United States Alien" means any Person that, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States Federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, "United States" means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction and "Code" means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, this Note and all other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note and all Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem such Notes pursuant to their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for
redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor and terms, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).

THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date specified above to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears, in each year, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Original Issue Date, at the Interest Rate per annum set forth above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment; , that if the Original Issue Date of this Note is between a Regular Record Date specified above and the related Interest Payment Date, the first payment of interest on this Note will be made on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered Holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Interest payments for this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date set forth above (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; , that interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable. If any Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect to this Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on such Interest Payment Date or at Maturity will be made on the following day that is a Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.  Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any interest not punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the Regular Record Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below), notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts;however, that at the option of the Company, payments of interest on this Note (other than at Maturity) may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Holder of this Note if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the applicable payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will make payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date other than the Maturity Date to each registered Holder of $10,000,000 (or, if the payment currency is other than United States dollars, the equivalent thereof in the particular payment currency) or more in aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (whether having identical or different terms and provisions) by wire transfer of immediately available funds if the applicable registered Holder has delivered appropriate wire transfer instructions in writing to the Trustee not less than 15 days prior to the particular Interest Payment Date.  Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee shall remain in effect until revoked by the applicable registered Holder.

Security is one of a series designated by the Company as its Medium-Term Notes, Series E (the "Notes"). The Indenture does not limit the aggregate principal amount of the Securities.
 
The Company issued this Note pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 24, 2001 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes are issuable as Registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of like tenor and terms of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged at any office or agency described below where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer.
 
The Company may from time to time, without the consent of existing Note Holders, issue additional Notes ("Additional Notes") having the same terms and conditions (including maturity and interest payment terms) as previously issued Notes in all respects, except for issue date, issue price and the first payment of interest.  Additional Notes issued in this manner will be fungible with the previously issued Notes to the extent specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement.
 
This Note may not be redeemed prior to the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above. If no Earliest Redemption Date is so set forth, this Note is not redeemable prior to the Maturity Date. This Note is redeemable at any time on or after the Earliest Redemption Date set forth above at the option of the Company, in whole or from time to time in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice mailed to the registered Holder hereof, at the Redemption Price set forth in the next succeeding paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Note is subject to the payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, then this Note may be redeemed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth below regarding Additional Amounts.

100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed; or
 
(2)
                                
as determined by the Independent Investment Banker (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on this Note to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the applicable Redemption Date) discounted to such Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points,
 
plus, in the case of both clauses (1) and (2) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of this Note being redeemed to such Redemption Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to a Redemption Date for this Note will be payable to the Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.  The following terms have the meanings set forth below:

The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.  As used in the preceding sentence and in the definition of "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" below, the term "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close in The City of New York.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, (i) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains six Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that Redemption Date, the average of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations after excluding the highest and lowest of those Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than six such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all of those quotations, or (iii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation, such quotation.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors appointed by the Company to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time, or if any such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in that capacity, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means, with respect to any Redemption Date for this Note, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date for this Note, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding that Redemption Date.
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, interest on this Note or portion hereof called for redemption will cease to accrue on the applicable Redemption Date.
 
In the event that this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, all payments of principal and interest with respect to this Note will be made without withholding or deduction at the source for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, fees, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such withholding or deduction is required by (i) the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or (ii) an official position regarding the application, administration, interpretation or enforcement of any such laws, regulations or rulings (including, without limitation, a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a taxing authority in the United States or any political subdivision thereof).
If a withholding or deduction at source is required, in the event this Note is subject to payment of Additional Amounts (as defined below) as specified above, the Company will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder hereof who is a United States Alien (as defined below), as additional interest, such amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that every net payment on this Note (including payment of the principal of and interest on this Note) by the Company or a Paying Agent, after deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in this Note to be then due and payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts will not apply to:

nor shall Additional Amounts be paid with respect to a payment on this Note to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts (or payment of Additional Amounts would not have been necessary) had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of this Note.  As used in this Note, "United States Alien" means any Person that, for United States Federal income tax purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of which is, for United States Federal income tax purposes, a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual or a non-resident alien fiduciary of a foreign estate or trust, "United States" means the United States of America (including the States and the District of Columbia) and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction and "Code" means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
If (a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in the official application (including a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States) or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note as described above, or (b) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) on or after the Original Issue Date of this Note, whether or not such act is taken with respect to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial likelihood that the Company will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts on this Note, on any other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note or on any Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note, then the Company may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, this Note and all other Notes with the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and other terms as this Note and all Additional Notes, if any, with the same Stated Maturity and other terms (other than Original Issue Date, issue price and first payment of interest) as this Note on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes or any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States (including of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) results in a substantial likelihood that it will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts described above and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem such Notes pursuant to their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date of any Note will be payable to the Holder of such Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) of record at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
All notices of redemption shall state the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price, if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of Notes to be redeemed, that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each Note, or portion thereof, to be redeemed, that interest on each Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption will cease to accrue on and including the Redemption Date and the place or places where Notes may be surrendered for
redemption. However, payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date, for a Note for which a redemption notice has been delivered is conditioned upon delivery of such Note (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) to the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Redemption Date) after delivery of the redemption notice.  Payment of the Redemption Price for the Note (or portion thereof to be redeemed), together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, will be made on the later of the Redemption Date or promptly following the time of delivery of the Note.
 
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of like tenor for the aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of this Note so surrendered will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
For all purposes of this Note and the Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption by the Company of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Notes redeemed or to be redeemed by the Company only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Notes which has been or is to be so redeemed.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, in certain circumstances therein specified, the amendment thereof without the consent of the Holders of the Securities. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or, subject to the provisions for satisfaction and discharge in Article Eight of the Indenture, of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of Notes is registrable in the register of Securities, upon surrender of a Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, initially designated to be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in Los Angeles, California, and at such additional offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of like tenor and terms, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge shall be made by the Company, the Trustee or the Registrar for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.11, 3.6, 9.5 or 10.3 of the Indenture, not involving any transfer).
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including without limitation,  5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Law Rule 327(b).
 
All undefined terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the proposed issuance and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.450% Global Notes Due 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.100% Global Notes Due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.350% Global Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.700% Global Notes Due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and together with the 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to the pricing supplement dated November 27, 2012 supplementing (i) the prospectus supplement dated December 8, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and (ii) the prospectus dated December 8, 2010 (the "Base Prospectus") that forms part of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-171048) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by the Company (the "Registration Statement").  As used in this letter, the term "Prospectus" means, collectively, the Pricing Supplement, Prospectus Supplement and Base Prospectus.  The Notes are to be issued under a Senior Debt Securities Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
We have examined (i) the Prospectus, (ii) the Registration Statement, (iii) the Indenture, (iv) the form of the Notes, (v) the executed Terms Agreement dated as of November 27, 2012 among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as Representatives of the Underwriters named therein, (vi) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as currently in effect, (vii) the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company as currently in effect, (viii) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to, among other things, the Registration Statement, the securities to be sold thereunder and the Indenture (the "Board Resolutions"), and (ix) officers' certificates executed by duly authorized officers of the Company establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Board Resolutions.  We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, or as retrieved from the SEC's EDGAR database, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  We also have assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.  In making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all their obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity and binding effect thereof.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein which were not independently established or verified by us, we have, with your consent, relied upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.
 
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
 
The Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms when the Notes shall have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture and the Board Resolutions and shall have been duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor.
 
The foregoing opinion as to enforceability of obligations of the Company is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (such principles of equity are of general application, and in applying such principles, a court may include a covenant of good faith and fair dealing and apply concepts of reasonableness and materiality).
 
Members of our firm are admitted to the Bar in the State of New York and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as in effect on the date hereof.  We disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement, and to all references to our firm included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the related rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
