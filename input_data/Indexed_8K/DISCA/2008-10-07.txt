Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On October 1, 2008, Discovery granted options to purchase its Series A common stock and cash-settled stock appreciation rights to certain of its named executive officers as follows: Brad Singer, Chief Financial Officer: In accordance with the terms of Mr. Singer's employment agreement with Discovery, he was granted options to purchase an aggregate of 808,371 shares of Series A common stock at an exercise price of $17.72 per share. Mr. Singer's grant agreements are generally identical to the Company's standard grant agreements, although Mr. Singer's grant of options over 527,198 shares of Series A common stock contains specific provisions that implement terms of Mr. Singer's employment agreement, including, but not limited to: if the Company terminates Mr. Singer's employment other than for Cause (as defined in his employment ageement), Mr. Singer terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in his employment agreement) or Mr. Singer's employment with the Company is terminated in certain oth er circumstances before those options are fully vested, the options will become 100% vested for a period of 150 days following the termination of Mr. Singer's employment. Mr. Singer's employment agreement provides that his initial option grant would be made at an exercise price that was the higher of fair market value for the Discovery Holding Company Series A common stock on July 15, 2008 or fair market value for Discovery Communications, Inc. Series A common stock on the grant date. The options vest in four equal annual installments beginning on July 15, 2009 and expire on October 1, 2015. Mr. Singer's grant agreements are filed as exhibits to this report. John Hendricks, Chairman of the Board and Founder: In accordance with the terms of Mr. Hendricks' Equity Stake Transition Term Sheet, Mr. Hendricks was granted options to purchase an aggregate of 5,708,289 shares of Series A common stock at an exercise price of $14.53, which was the closing price on the date of grant. The options vest in four equal annual installments beginning on October 1, 2009 and expire on October 1, 2018. Mr. Hendricks' grant agreement is generally identical to the Company's standard grant agreements, although Mr. Hendricks' option agreement includes specific provisions that implement the terms of his Equity State Transition Term Sheet as follows: if Mr. Hendricks' employment ends on a termination without Cause (as defined in the Equity Stake Transition Term Sheet), retirement (defined as voluntary termination of employment after reaching age 65), or in certain other circumstances, the exercisability of his options will accelerate and he will be able to exercise the options until the end of their original term, rather than for a more limited period. In addition, as part of this grant and the Equity Stake Transition Term Sheet, Mr. Hendricks has agreed to certain restrictive covenants related to post-employment competition and to releasing claims on termination. The option grant provides for forfeiture of the options or disgorgement of option gains (based on the spread at exercise) if he either fails to provide an effective release or violates the restrictive convenants. Mr. Hendricks' grant agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report. Mark Hollinger, Chief Operating Officer: In connection with the vesting of a portion of Mr. Hollinger's outstanding DAP units on October 1, 2008, Mr. Hollinger was granted two cash-settled stock appreciation rights. One grant, for 269,749 units, becomes exercisable on March 15, 2009 and expires on March 15, 2010. The other grant, for 269,750 units, will be automatically exercised on March 15, 2010. Both grants have an initial price of $14.53 per unit. Mr. Hollinger's award was made on the same terms as awards to other employees. The form of grant agreement is filed as an exhibit to this report. Additionally, Discovery amended its Discovery Appreciation Plan to reflect that the units awarded under the Plan should track the value of Discovery's Series A common stock rathe r than that of its predecessor, Discovery Holding Company, and other similar changes to reflect that the merger had taken place. Discovery also amended the Plan to have Change in Control provisions that were consistent with those in the 2005 Incentive Plan. A copy of the Discovery Appreciation Plan, reflecting those amendments is filed herewith.

Further, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan constitutes a mere promise of the Company to make benefit payments in the future and it is the intention of the Company that the Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
Section 9.
Successors
.
The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor company and shall continue to be binding upon the Company notwithstanding any change in ownership of the Company.
Section 10.
Non-Alienation of Benefits; Offset and Counterclaim
.
Except insofar as applicable law may otherwise require, (i) no Appreciation Units, rights or interests of Participants under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation by anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, bankruptcy, pledge, attachment, charge or encumbrance of any kind, and any attempt to so alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, attach, charge or otherwise encumber any such units, rights or interests shall be void; and (ii) to the full extent permitted by law, the Plan shall in no manner be liable for, or subject to, claims, liens, attachments or other like proceedings or to the debts, liabilities, contracts, engagements, or torts of any Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere to the contrary, the Company's obligation to make any payment pursuant to, and otherwise to perform its obligations under, the Plan with respect to a Participant shall be subject to setoff, counterclaim and the Company's other rights with respect to any claim the Company may have against such Participant for any reason; provided that, to the extent required by Section 409A, the setoff shall occur no earlier than the time any such payment would otherwise occur pursuant to the Plan.
Section 11.
No Right to Participation or Employment
.
No employee of the Company, any Subsidiary or any other entity controlled by the Company shall at any time have the right to be selected as a Participant in the Plan or, having been selected as a Participant and granted an Award, to be granted any additional Award. No Participant shall at any time have any right to receive payments under the Plan except as provided under Section 7. Neither the action of the Company in establishing the Plan or any action taken by it or by the shareholders, the Compensation Committee, any delegate thereof, nor any provision of the Plan, nor participation in the Plan, shall be construed to (i) give, and shall not give, to any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or other entity, (ii) interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary or other entity to discharge or terminate any person at any time without regard to the effect such discharge or termination may have upon such person's rights, if any, under the Plan, or (iii) cause any Participant to be (or be deemed to be) a shareholder of the Company.
Section 12.
Taxes
The Company may make such provisions and take such actions as it deems necessary or appropriate for the withholding of all federal, state, local and other taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to Appreciation Units or payments made under the Plan. In the event the Company pays Unit Benefits to any Participant in the form of shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(c) hereof, the Company may either require such Participant to pay the amount of any applicable taxes, withhold enough of such payment in shares to pay any such taxes, or take such other measures as may be necessary for the payment of taxes hereunder.
Section 13.
Payments to Persons Other Than Participants
.
Each Participant shall file with the Company, on a form prescribed for such purpose by the Company (or on such other form as the Company, in its sole discretion, may deem acceptable), a written designation of one or more persons as the Beneficiary who shall be entitled to receive the amount, if any, payable under the Plan in the event of his or her death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his Beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior Beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Company. The last such designation received by the Company shall be controlling; provided, however, that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Company prior to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. In the case of any election that may be made by a Beneficiary of a Participant hereunder, such election shall not be valid unless agreed to by all then-designated Beneficiaries of such Participant. If, and to the extent, an effective written beneficiary designation has not been made as of the Participant's death, then any Unit Benefits payable with respect to the Participant following his or her death shall be paid to, and the Beneficiary for purposes of the Plan shall be deemed to be, the Participant's estate.
13.1
Designation and Change of Beneficiary
.
If any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan has died or if the Company shall find that such person is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, then any payment due to such person may be paid to his or her estate, spouse or other relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of the person, or any other person deemed by the Company to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Plan, the Compensation Committee, its delegate(s), and the Company therefor.
13.2
Payments to Non-Beneficiaries/Non-Participants
.
Section 14.
Missing Persons
.
If the Company cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the Plan, and if, after two years from the date such payment is due, a notice of such payment due is mailed to the last known address of such person, as shown on the Company's records, the Company, or an entity controlled by the Company, and within three months after such mailing such person has not made written claim therefor, the Company may direct that such payment and all remaining payments that are or may become otherwise due to such person be canceled. Upon such cancellation, the Company shall have no further liability therefor; provided appropriate provision is made to credit such payments, without interest, if such person subsequently makes a claim therefor.
Section 15.
No Liability of Compensation Committee Members and Others
.
No member of the Compensation Committee or its delegates, or any officer or employee of the Company, shall be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by such person on his or her behalf in his or her capacity as a member of the Compensation Committee or as a delegate, officer or employee, for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Compensation Committee and each employee and shareholder of the Company to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan may be allocated or delegated against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Company) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person's own fraud or bad faith.
Section 16.
Other Plans
.
Nothing contained in the Plan is intended to amend, modify or rescind any previously approved compensation plans, programs or arrangements entered into by the Company or DCI or any Subsidiary or other entity. The Plan shall be construed to be in addition to any and all such plans, programs or arrangements, provided it is understood that Participants who have elected to participate in this Plan are no longer participants in the EIP. No Award of Appreciation Units or payment under the Plan shall be construed as compensation under any other executive compensation or employee benefit plan of the Company or DCI or any Subsidiary or other entity, except as specifically provided in any such plan or as otherwise provided by the Company. In case any provision of any summary, or prior version, of the Plan shall be inconsistent with the terms set forth herein, the terms set forth herein, or in any amendment hereof, shall be controlling.
Section 17.
Amendment, Suspension or Termination
.
The Compensation Committee may, with prospective or retroactive effect, amend or suspend the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however, that no amendment or suspension of the Plan shall adversely affect the rights of any Participant with respect to any vested Awards already made under the Plan, without his or her written consent. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Compensation Committee may, with prospective or retroactive effect, (a) amend or suspend the Plan or any portion thereof at any time for the purpose of rendering the Plan consistent with applicable law; and/or (b) to the extent permitted by Section 409A, accelerate the payment of awards under the Plan. The Plan may not be terminated except in compliance with applicable law.
Section 18.
Claims Procedures
.
A Participant may notify the Compensation Committee in writing of a claim for benefits under the Plan. If the claim is denied, the Compensation Committee (or its delegate (in accordance with the discretionary authority of the Compensation Committee to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan)) will provide the claimant with written notice specifying the reason for denial and indicating the Plan provisions on which the denial is based, and explaining what additional information (if any) the claimant should submit to prove that he or she is entitled to the benefit claimed. Generally, except as otherwise required by law, notice of denial must be communicated within 90 days of receipt of the claim, although this period may be extended for up to 90 more days under special circumstances. If an extension is necessary, the claimant will be notified within the first 90-day period. If the Compensation Committee (or its delegate) does not provide the claimant with written notice of its decision regarding the claim, within the applicable time period, the claim will be deemed denied as of the last day of the applicable claim period.
If the Participant's initial claim is denied (or deemed denied), the Participant will be given an explanation of the claims review procedures and at least 60 days to request a review of the claim. The claimant's request for a review of the claim denial shall be made to the Compensation Committee. The claimant is entitled to review pertinent Plan documents and records and to submit issues and comments in support of the claim in writing. Except as otherwise required by law, the decision of the Compensation Committee on review will be made and communicated to the claimant in writing no later than 60 days after receipt of the request for review, unless there are special circumstances requiring an extension of up to 60 additional days. If an extension is necessary, the claimant will be notified within the first 60-day period. A Participant must exhaust his or her rights under the Plan's claims procedures before the Participant may pursue his or her claim in court.

The Plan and all rights thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without reference to the principles of the conflicts of laws thereof.
Section 21.
Severability
.
If any provision of the Plan is held to be void, illegal, unenforceable or otherwise in conflict with the law governing the Plan, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the other provisions of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.

ATTACHMENT A
FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION PAID, receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I, , for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, do hereby release, acquit and forever discharge Discovery Communications, LLC ("Discovery"), its subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities, as well as all of their respective officers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, agents, employees and representatives (hereafter collectively, the "Discovery Parties"), from all obligations, claims, demands, covenants, contracts, promises, agreements, liabilities, controversies, costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, actions or causes of action whatsoever, whether known or unknown, I ever had or now have or claim to have against the Discovery Parties from the beginning of the world to the day and date hereof, including any claim relating to the termination of my employment with Discovery, and further including specifically but not exclusively, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all claims, demands and causes of action, known or unknown, arising out of any transaction, act or omission concerning my former employment by Discovery and/or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and all claims of every kind that may arise under any federal, state or local statutory or common law, including the federal Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Maryland Human Rights Act, as well as any similar state or local statute(s), in each case as any such law may be amended from time to time; or any action arising in tort or contract. The foregoing shall, in accordance with applicable law, not prohibit or prevent me from filing a Change with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and/or any state or local agency equivalent, and/or prohibit me from participating in any investigation of any Charge filed by others, except that I understand and agree that I shall not be entitled to seek monetary compensation for myself from the filing and/or participation in any such Charge.
     
I hereby acknowledge that my attorney has advised me regarding, and that I am familiar with, the fact that certain state statutes provide that general releases do not extend to claims that I do not know or suspect to exist in my favor at the time I execute such a release, which if known by me may have materially affected my execution of the release. Being aware of such statutes, I hereby expressly waive and relinquish any rights or benefits I may have under such statutes, as well as any other state or federal statutes or common law principles of similar effect.
I also hereby specifically and knowingly waive the provisions of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, which reads: A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor. Notwithstanding the provisions of Civil Code Section 1542 stated above and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Discovery Parties, I expressly acknowledge that this General Release is intended to include in its effect all claims that I do not know or suspect to exist in my favor at the time I sign this General Release.
I hereby acknowledge that I am executing this General Release pursuant to Section 7.
3(a)
of Discovery's Discovery Appreciation Plan (the "Plan"), and that certain consideration to be provided to me pursuant to Section 7.
3(a)
of the Plan is in addition to what I would have been entitled to receive in the absence of this General Release. I hereby acknowledge that I am executing this General Release voluntarily and with full knowledge of all relevant information and any and all rights I may have. I hereby acknowledge that I have been advised to consult with an independent attorney of my own choosing in connection with this General Release to explain to me the legal effect of the terms and conditions of this General Release. I hereby acknowledge that I am voluntarily and knowingly agreeing to the terms and conditions of this General Release without any threats, coercion or duress, whether economic or otherwise, and that I agree to be bound by the terms of this General Release. I acknowledge that I have been given twenty-one (21) days (or 45 days if required by law) to consider this General Release, and that I may execute this General release prior to the expiration of the twenty-one days that I have to consider this release and that if I do so it will be without any coercion, threats or duress, and that if I am over the age of forty (40), I understand that I have seven (7) days following my execution of this General Release in which to revoke my agreement to comply with this General Release by providing written notice of revocation to the General Counsel of Discovery no later than one business day following such period.
I further hereby covenant and agree that this General Release shall be binding in all respects upon myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, assigns and transferees and all persons claiming under them, and shall inure to the benefit of all of the officers, directors, agents, employees, stockholders, members and partners and successors in interest of Discovery, as well as all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related entities and representatives of any of the foregoing persons and entities.
I understand and agree that in connection with my voluntary termination of employment with Discovery, I am entitled to receive benefits under Section 7.3(a) of the Plan, subject to the obligations imposed on and assumed by me, as described in Section 7.3(a) of the Plan, which I have read, understood, agreed to and complied with. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I hereby certify and agree that (a) during the twelve-month period following my last day of employment with Discovery and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates, I have not and will not provide services to or otherwise act (in any capacity, including, but not limited to, as an employee, officer, director, partner, manager, member, consultant or advisor) on behalf of any Competitor (as such term is defined in the Plan) of Discovery or directly solicit any employees of Discovery to leave their employment or indirectly aid in the solicitation of such employees, and (b) at no time following the termination of my employment with Discovery have I disparaged or will I disparage Discovery or make or publish any communication that reflects adversely upon such entities, including communications concerning Discovery, its subsidiaries or affiliates, as well as the current or former shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of any of the foregoing.
I agree that if I render or reasonably expect to render services to or otherwise act on behalf of a Competitor (as defined in the Plan), I shall promptly notify Discovery in writing of such fact. I acknowledge and agree that, if I fail to comply with the obligations imposed on and assumed by me, as described in Section 7.3(a) of the Plan and this General Release, or I otherwise breach or threaten to breach such promises and covenants, Discovery shall have the right to the immediate return, in cash, of the additional twenty-five percent (25%) referred to in the proviso of clause (i) of Section 7.3(a) upon the provision of written notice of same by telecopier, U.S. Mail or delivery service to me at the last known address of my principal residence on the Company's books and records. I acknowledge and agree that if I (or, as applicable, my beneficiary) fail to return such amount to Discovery within ten (10) days of delivery of notice by Discovery, Discovery shall be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies Discovery or any of its affiliates may have at law, in equity or otherwise, including but not limited to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction and damages relating to any such breach or threatened breach.
