If the board determines that an investor is not a Passive Investor, or has ceased to be a Passive Investor, the board of directors may direct the investor to reduce his, her or its beneficial ownership in the Company below 10% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding and/or take such other action as the board may request before triggering the issuance of the Rights. This summary of the amendment to the Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement dated December 10, 2008, which is filed as an exhibit hereto.

WHEREAS, on or about September 17, 2008, the Company and the Rights Agent entered into that one certain Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement");
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend certain provisions of the Rights Agreement;
WHEREAS, no Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has become an Acquiring Person; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Rights Agreement pursuant to Section 27 thereof as set forth below.
NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, in consideration of the premises, covenants and of the mutual agreements set forth herein and in the Rights Agreement, and other good, sufficient and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and do hereby agree as follows:
Section 1. . The Rights Agreement is amended as follows:
Amendments
(a) Section 1(a) is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
"'' shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor (as such term is hereinafter defined), 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding), but shall not include an Exempt Person, but only so long as such Person continues to be an Exempt Person; , , that if such Exempt Person fails to meet the requirements set forth herein as an Exempt Person, then such Person shall, to the extent such Person Beneficially Owns 10% or more of the shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding, be deemed to be an Acquiring Person for purposes of this Agreement, unless such Person ceased to be an Exempt Person as a result of a Transfer (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) of all of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (and Series A Conversion Shares) Beneficially Owned by such Person, in which case such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement unless and until such Person shall, following such Transfer, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock) unless upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock such Person does not Beneficially Own 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor, 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding); , , that (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person" became the Beneficial Owner of a number of shares of Common Stock such that the Person would otherwise qualify as an "Acquiring Person" inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it Beneficially Owned a percentage of Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person" or (B) although such Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock, such Person had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Agreement) and without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Company, then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement unless and until such Person shall have failed to divest itself, as soon as practicable (as determined, in good faith, by the Board of Directors of the Company), of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient number ofshares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer otherwise Beneficially Own 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor, 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) and/or take such other actions as the Board of Directors of the Company may require; (ii) if, as of the effectiveness of the Merger, any Person is the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the number ofshares of Common Stock outstanding, such Person shall not be deemed to be or to become an "Acquiring Person" unless and until such time as such Person shall, after the effectiveness of the Merger, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock), unless, upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding; and (iii) no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of shares of Common Stock by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number ofshares of Common Stock Beneficially Owned by such Person to 10% or more of the number ofshares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor, 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding), , , that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor, 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding) by reason of such share acquisitions by the Company and shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" unless upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock such Person does not Beneficially Own 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (or if such Person is a Passive Investor, 20% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding). For all purposes of this Agreement, any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including for purposes of determining the particular percentage of such outstanding shares of Common Stock of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " "), as in effect on the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Passive Investor no longer satisfies the requirements set forth in the definition of "Passive Investor" set forth below and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that such Person failed to satisfy the requirements of the "Passive Investor" definition inadvertently (including, without limitation, because such Person had no actual knowledge that his, her or its actions would lead to a loss of "Passive Investor" status) and, in any event, such loss of "Passive Investor" status was not by reason of failing to satisfy the requirements of clause (ii) of such definition, then such Person will not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement unless and until such Person shall have failed to divest itself, as soon as practicable (as determined, in good faith, by the Board of Directors of the Company), of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer otherwise Beneficially Own 10% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and/or take such other actions as the Board of Directors of the Company may require. If such Person does not divest itself of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the requirements set forth in the prior sentence and/or take such other actions as may be required by the Board of Directors of the Company, then such Person shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person for purposes of this Agreement."
