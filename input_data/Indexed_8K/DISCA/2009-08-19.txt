On August 19, 2009, Discovery Communications, LLC ("DCL") completed its registered offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes"). The Notes were sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated August 12, 2009, among DCL, Discovery Communications, Inc. ("Discovery") and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as the representatives of the several underwriters named therein.
The Notes were sold to the public at a price of 99.428% of the principal amount, and DCL received net proceeds of approximately $493 million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. DCL will use the net proceeds of the offering to repay approximately $428 million of indebtedness outstanding under its Term Loan A, prior to final maturity on October 31, 2010. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on August 15 and February 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2010. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2019. DCL may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of DCL's other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Discovery.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture and a supplemental indenture, dated as of August 19, 2009, among DCL, Discovery and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The indenture and supplemental indenture contain certain covenants and events of default and other customary provisions.
The foregoing descriptions of the Notes, the indenture and the supplemental indenture are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents. Copies of the indenture and the supplemental indenture are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Unless otherwise indicated in a Consent of the Sole Member, Officer's Certificate or supplemental indenture for a particular series, interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The Securities of each series shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and such interest shall be payable on the dates, established as contemplated by Section 2.04.
     The Person in whose name any Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer, exchange or conversion of such Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names Outstanding Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Company to the Holders of Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) for the Securities of any series shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of such series established as contemplated by Section 2.04, or, if no such date is so established, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the 15th day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the 15th day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
     Section 2.09 . The Company will keep at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.02 for each series of Securities a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will provide for the registration of Securities of such series and the registration of transfer of Securities of such series. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
     Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.02, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
     At the option of the Holder thereof, Securities of any series (except a Global Security) may be exchanged for a Security or Securities of such series having authorized denominations
 
and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Company that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.02 and upon payment, if the Company shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

     All Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
     The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or other tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
     The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.09, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.05, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company's election pursuant to Section 2.04 that the Securities of such series be represented by a Global Security shall no longer be effective and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing the Securities of such series, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by a
 
Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series, in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of the same series in definitive registered form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
     (i) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
     (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
     Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive registered form, in authorized denominations, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof and in the case of mutilation or defacement shall surrender the Security to the Trustee.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full, or is being surrendered for conversion in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security (with the Holder's consent, in the case of convertible Securities), pay or authorize the payment of the same or convert, or authorize conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     Section 2.11 All Securities surrendered for exchange for Securities of the same series or for payment, redemption, registration of transfer, conversion or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Company or the Guarantor or any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities held by it and deliver a certificate of disposition to the Company. If the Company or the Guarantor shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Debt represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof.
     Section 2.12 Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee).

Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series, unless the benefits of the temporary Securities are limited pursuant to Section 2.04.
     Section 3.01 The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities and in this Indenture. The interest on Securities (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only to or upon the written order of the Holders thereof and at the option of the Company may be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to or upon the written order of such Holders at their last addresses as they appear on the Security register of the Company.

     Section 7.01 Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02) conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantor, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders.
     Section 7.02 Subject to Sections 6.01 and 6.02, the execution of any instrument by a Holder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding of Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the registrar thereof. The Company or the Guarantor may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 7.01, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, only Holders of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent. Notice of such record date may be given before or after any request for any action referred to in Section 7.01 is made by the Company or the Guarantor.
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities.
     Section 7.03 The Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving
Holders to Be Treated as Owners.

All such payments so made to any such Person, or upon his or her order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable.
     Section 7.04 In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, the Guarantor or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice.

Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.

For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company or the Guarantor shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Defeased Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 5.06, 5.07, 6.06, 6.10 and 10.02 of this Indenture and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such series of Securities and this Indenture and cured all existing Events of Default insofar as such series of Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, and, upon written request, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same).

For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Defeased Securities, the Company or the Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or Article described in this Section 10.05, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or Article described in this Section 10.05 or by reason of any reference in any such Section or Article described in this Section 10.05 to any other provisions herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01 but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Defeased Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Covenant Defeasance
     Section 10.06 . The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 10.04 or Section 10.05 to a series of outstanding Securities.
Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance

     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder entitled thereto, at his or her last address as it appears in the Security register. In any case where notice to such Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
     In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Company or the Guarantor when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.
     In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event to Holders of Securities when said notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture or of the Securities, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice. Neither the failure to give notice, nor any defect in any notice so given, to any particular Holder of a Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Securities given as provided above.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained Therein.
 
Guarantor, as applicable shall furnish to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.
     Each certificate or opinion provided for in this Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (a) a statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition, (b) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based, (c) a statement that, in the opinion of such person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with and (d) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.
     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Company or the Guarantor may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Company or the Guarantor, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or officers of the Company or the Guarantor, unless such counsel knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Company or an officer of the Guarantor or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Company or the Guarantor, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
     Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with and directed to the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent.

In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Indenture or in the Securities of any series shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Indenture or of such Securities, but this Indenture and such Securities shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein.
Severability
     Section 12.01 The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified, as contemplated by Section 2.04 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article.
     Section 12.02 Notice of redemption to the Holders of Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Company shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security register. Any notice which is given in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions.
 
notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
     The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue and shall also specify, if applicable, the conversion price then in effect and the date on which the right to convert such Securities or the portions thereof to be redeemed will expire. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
     The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
     On or before the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.04) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption (other than those theretofore surrendered for conversion into Common Stock) at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If any Security called for redemption is converted pursuant hereto, any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall be paid to the Company upon the Company's request, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust. The Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 70 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter time period shall be acceptable to the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate (which need not comply with Section 11.05) stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Company prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officer's Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
     If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
 
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. If any Security selected for partial redemption is surrendered for conversion after such selection, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption.
     Section 12.03 If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and, except as provided in Sections 6.05 and 10.04, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be convertible into Common Stock, if applicable, and to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; , that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.03 and 2.07 hereof.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
provided
     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security and, if applicable, such Security shall remain convertible into Common Stock until the principal of such Security shall have been paid or duly provided for.
     Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
     Section 12.04 Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company.

optional sinking fund payment
sinking fund payment date
     In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Company or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11 and, if applicable, receive credit for Securities (not previously so credited) converted into Common Stock and so delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Company through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
     On or before the 60th day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.05) (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Company intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Company to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.11 to the Trustee with such Officer's Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officer's Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Company shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Company, on or before any such 60th day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof.
     If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or a lesser sum in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency if the Company shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on
 
the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.02, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Company) inform the Company of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company (or the Company, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing), shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.02 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.03) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Company. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series, shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity. The Company's obligation to make a mandatory or optional sinking fund payment shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to the sinking fund redemption price allocable to any Securities or portions thereof called for redemption pursuant to the preceding paragraph on any sinking fund payment date and converted into Common Stock; , if the Trustee is not the conversion agent for the Securities, the Company or such conversion agent shall give the Trustee written notice prior to the date fixed for redemption of the principal amount of Securities or portions thereof so converted.
provided that
     On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
     The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 5 and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10, or the default cured on or before the 60th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
 
     Section 13.01 . The Guarantor hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Security of each series issued by the Company, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal (including any amount due in respect of any Original Issue Discount Security) of and any premium and interest on such Security, and the due and punctual payment of any sinking fund payments provided for pursuant to the terms of such Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of such Security and this Indenture. The Guarantor hereby agrees that in the event of an Event of Default its obligations hereunder shall be as if it were a principal debtor and not merely a surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any Security of any series or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any Security of any series or this Indenture, any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto by the Holder of any Security of any series or the Trustee, or any other circumstances which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantor, increase the principal amount of any Security or the interest rate thereon or increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, the benefit of discussion, protest or notice with respect to any Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect to any sinking fund payment required pursuant to the terms of such Security issued under this Indenture and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged with respect to such Security except by payment in full of the principal thereof and any premium and interest thereon or as provided in Article 10 or Section 9.02. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or the Guarantor any amount paid by the Company or the Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. The Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 5 hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby.
Guarantee
     The Guarantor also agrees, to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holders in enforcing any rights under this Guarantee.
     The Guarantor hereby waives any right of set off which the Guarantor may have against the Holder of any Security in respect of any amounts which are or may become payable by such Holder to the Company.
     The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of any series of Securities and the Trustee against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to such Holders and the
 
Trustee by the Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of the Guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all of the Securities of such series shall have been paid in full.
     No past, present or future stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator of the Guarantor shall have any personal liability under the Guarantee set forth in this Section 13.01 by reason of his, her or its status as such stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator.
     The Guarantee set forth in this Section 13.01 shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose with respect to any Security until the certificate of authentication on such Security shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee.
     Section 13.02 . To evidence its Guarantee to the Holders specified in Section 13.01, the Guarantor hereby agrees to execute the notation of the Guarantee in substantially the form set forth in Section 2.03 to be endorsed on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. The Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 13.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on any Security a notation of such Guarantee. Each such notation of Guarantee shall be signed on behalf of the Guarantor by any proper officer of the Guarantor prior to the authentication of the Security on which it is endorsed, and the delivery of such Security by the Trustee, after the due authentication thereof by the Trustee hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Guarantee on behalf of the Guarantor. Such signatures upon the notation of the Guarantee may be manual or facsimile signatures of any present, past or future proper officer of the Guarantor and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced below the notation of the Guarantee, and in case any such proper officer of the Guarantor who shall have signed the notation of the Guarantee shall cease to be such officer before the Security on which such notation is endorsed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Company, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed the notation of the Guarantee had not ceased to be such officer of the Guarantor.
