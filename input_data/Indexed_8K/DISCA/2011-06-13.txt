Discovery is providing this recent developments information to update its disclosure in order to facilitate its bond offering.
HUB LLC Agreement Amendment
In May 2011, Discovery Communications, LLC ("DCL"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discovery Communications, Inc. ("Discovery") amended its agreement with Hasbro, Inc. regarding The HUB to revise the license fees paid by The HUB for animated programs. This amendment creates a trigger event for purposes of intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing. The HUB's management is in the process of conducting a fair value analysis to support goodwill impairment testing, however the assessment is not complete and no determinations have been made. We currently expect that the evaluation will be completed during the third quarter of 2011.
