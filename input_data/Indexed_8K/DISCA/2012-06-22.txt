Item 3.01.    Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
 
(a) On June 18, 2012, Discovery Communications, Inc. (the "Company") received a notice of deficiency from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ") indicating that the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ's audit committee requirements as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605.
   NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605 requires that the Company's audit committee comprise at least three independent directors. The Company's noncompliance with this requirement results from the previously announced resignation of Lawrence Kramer from the Company's board of directors and the Company's audit committee, effective June 1, 2012. Due to Mr. Kramer's resignation, the Company's audit committee currently comprises two members, each of whom is independent for purposes of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
   Consistent with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(c)(4), NASDAQ has provided the Company a cure period to regain compliance until the earlier of the next annual meeting of the Company's stockholders (currently anticipated to be held in May 2013) or June 3, 2013; however, if the next annual meeting of the Company's stockholders is held before November 28, 2012, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than November 28, 2012.
   The Company expects to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605 prior to the end of the cure period described above by appointing an additional independent director to the Company's audit committee.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
