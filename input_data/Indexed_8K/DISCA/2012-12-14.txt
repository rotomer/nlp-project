Item 8.01. Other Events
On December 11, 2012, the Discovery Communication, Inc. (Discovery) Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase program, which will expire on December 11, 2014, to a total of $4.0 billion. Discovery's stock repurchase program was first approved by the Board of Directors in July 2010 and would have expired in April 2014. Discovery expects to fund repurchases under the stock repurchase program through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and future financing transactions. Accordingly, Discovery's stock repurchase program is subject to the Company having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the program, management is authorized to purchase shares of Discovery's common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors.
