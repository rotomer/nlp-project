FORM 8-K SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON D.C. 20549 CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report: July 30, 2002 Date of Earliest Event Reported: July 25, 2002 DOLLAR TREE STORES, INC. (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) COMMISSION FILE NUMBER: 0-25464 VIRGINIA 54-1387365 (State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure The following summarizes information discussed in Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.'s (the Company's) publicly available telephone conference call on July 25, 2002 regarding its second quarter 2002 earnings results. In addition, the Company's second quarter earnings press release dated July 25, 2002 is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Company is filing this Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD. Sales We expect sales to increase approximately 18%-19% for the full year 2002 based on an underlying comparable store net sales increase of approximately 1%-2% for the remainder of 2002. There are six fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which represents significant sales for us. There can be no assurance that comparable store net sales increases will be realized in the second half of 2002. Gross Margin Gross profit margin for the second quarter improved compared to the second quarter of 2001 primarily due to improved shrink results, particularly in our Dollar Express stores. Decreased markdowns due to better inventory flow, good seasonal sell through and lower inventory levels also contributed to our gross profit margin improvement. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales, due to a loss of leverage resulting from the 2.5% decrease in comparable store net sales. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 3.6% of net sales for the second quarter of 2002 compared to 2.9% for the same period in 2001. The increase resulted primarily from the implementation of our supply chain system in April 2002, as well as accelerated depreciation of store registers being replaced by our new point-of-sale systems. Our new and expanded stores also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense. We estimate depreciation and amortization expense will total approximately $19 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Operating Income We expect operating income margin improvement in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 compared to 2001, as a result of our store-level expense management initiatives. Inventories Inventory levels increased 14.0% compared to June 30, 2001, while sales increased approximately 19.4% and selling square footage increased approximately 26.0%. Inventory at comparable stores declined 2.0%. We expect that our inventory growth will continue to be less than our sales growth in the second half of 2002 because of management's increased focus on inventory management and merchandise flow. In addition, we have planned inventory to support sales growth of approximately 18-19%. Real Estate We opened 148 stores, expanded 51 stores and closed 18 stores during the first half of 2002. Of the 18 stores closed, eight represented unprofitable Spain's Card and Gift stores acquired in connection with our Dollar Express merger in May 2000. We expect to increase selling square-footage by approximately 25% in 2002 and 20%-25% in 2003. Supply Chain We are currently operating point-of-sale in over 600 stores and expect to end 2002 with a total of 750-800 point-of-sale stores.

EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DOLLAR TREE STORES, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.22 CHESAPEAKE, Va. - July 25, 2002 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: DLTR), the nation's leading retailer of variety merchandise at the $1.00 price point, reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.22. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $498.6 million. For the quarter, gross margin was 36.1% compared to 35.7% for the second quarter of 2001. This improvement resulted primarily from better shrink results and fewer markdowns, somewhat offset by deleveraging of occupancy costs. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 24.1% compared to 24.7% in the second quarter of 2001. The improvement primarily relates to better management of store payroll and related costs. These improvements, somewhat offset by an increase in depreciation because of the Company's supply-chain systems implementation, resulted in an 8.4% operating margin for the quarter. "We are pleased to report record earnings for the second quarter," Chairman and CEO Macon Brock Jr., said. "We are particularly proud of our field and store management, who responded well to the Easter shift. Post-Easter sales trends have been encouraging. The implementation of our supply-chain management systems has been seamless, and we look forward to the inventory-management benefits it will provide. We remain vigilant in our pursuit of profitable growth and expense control." First-half 2002 sales were $988.2 million, up 19.4% from the same period last year. Sales at comparable stores for the first six months of 2002 rose 2% over the first half of 2001. Earnings per share of $0.42 in the first half of 2002 are 45% higher than the $0.29 reported for the comparable 2001 period.
