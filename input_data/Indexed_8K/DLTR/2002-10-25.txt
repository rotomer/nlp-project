Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure The following summarizes information discussed in Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.'s (the Company's) publicly available telephone conference call on October 24, 2002, regarding its third quarter 2002 earnings results. In addition, the Company's third quarter earnings press release dated October 24, 2002 is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The Company is filing this Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation FD. Net Sales In the fourth quarter of 2002, we expect net sales to increase approximately 15-16% over the fourth quarter of 2001 to $825-$830 million. Our expectations are based on flat underlying comparable store net sales and our projected store-opening plans for the remainder of 2002. Sales trends in the first-half of October 2002 have improved slightly over a disappointing September 2002. Gross Margin Gross margin for the third quarter improved compared to the third quarter of 2001 primarily due to lower distribution costs as a percentage of net sales and improved shrink results. Lower distribution costs as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from increased inventory levels, which caused a higher percentage of these costs to be capitalized, and improved efficiencies and productivity. Lower shrink in our Dollar Express stores was the primary contributor to our overall third quarter 2002 shrink improvements. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were flat due to an increase in depreciation expense offset by decreases in other operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2002 compared to the same quarter in 2001, but increased only 2% compared to the second quarter of 2002. The increases were primarily due to depreciation costs associated with our new supply chain technology, our store relocation and expansion program, and the opening of larger stores. In 2003, we expect depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 3%. Operating Income We expect fourth quarter 2002 operating margin to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2001, given our sales guidance. Inventories Inventory levels increased 21.8% compared to September 30, 2001, while net sales increased approximately 15.3% and selling square footage increased approximately 26.0%. The increase in inventory levels is consistent with our typical seasonality. 2
We do not expect to experience any material impact from the west coast port disruptions, and we have received approximately 97% of our Christmas merchandise. We expect our inventory growth will be more in line with our net sales growth for the full year 2002 as we continue to focus on inventory management and productivity. Real Estate We opened 231 stores, expanded 83 stores and closed 27 stores during the first nine months of 2002. During 2002, we have opened more larger stores than originally planned, which required us to shift our store openings to later in the third quarter and shift some store openings into the fourth quarter. Larger stores take longer to negotiate, build out and open compared to our smaller square footage stores. Our square footage growth in the future will come primarily from larger stores. Supply Chain We are currently operating point-of-sale in over 730 stores and expect to end 2002 with a total of approximately 800 point-of-sale stores.

o the capacity and performance of our distribution network and our ability to expand its capacity in time to support our net sales growth.

EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DOLLAR TREE STORES, INC. REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.17 CHESAPEAKE, Va. - October 24, 2002 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: DLTR), the nation's leading retailer of variety merchandise at the $1.00 price point, reported third-quarter earnings per share of $0.17, a 35% increase from last year's third quarter. Both quarters' results are inclusive of $1.4 million of non-cash expense related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $513.5 million. "These results reflect our ongoing commitment to productivity improvement and cost control," President and COO Bob Sasser commented. "As we open larger stores, we will continue to focus on those two key areas." For the quarter, gross margin was 35.6% compared to 34.7% for the third quarter of 2001, primarily due to increased capitalization of distribution costs and improvements in shrink. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were flat at 28.9%. Improvements in payroll and related costs partially offset higher store operating and depreciation expenses. In addition, last year's results include $1.7 million of costs related to a terminated distribution center lease. For the quarter, operating margin was 6.6%, compared to 5.8% in last year's third quarter. "The plans we put in place last year have enabled us to deliver strong earnings growth, despite a challenging economy," CEO Macon Brock, Jr., said. "I am proud of the performance of our management team and the consistency of our results. Our staffing and inventory are well-positioned for the upcoming holiday season, and we are pleased to see that sales in October have improved." Based on an estimate for fourth-quarter sales of $825-$830 million, the Company plans to achieve an operating margin consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Sales for the first nine months of 2002 were $1.5 billion, up 18% from the same period last year. Sales at comparable stores for the first nine months of 2002 rose 1.5% over the comparable 2001 period. Diluted earnings per share of $0.59 in the first nine months of 2002 are 42% higher than the comparable 2001 period.
