EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DOLLAR TREE REPORTS RECORD SALES, UNVEILS 2003 GROWTH PLANS Board Also Appoints New Director, Approves New Fiscal Year CHESAPEAKE, Va. - January 7, 2003 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported fourth-quarter 2002 sales of $827.5 million, in-line with the Company's previous guidance, and a 15.8% increase compared to $714.8 million in 2001's fourth quarter. "I am pleased with our sales performance in this challenging environment," said CEO Macon Brock, Jr. "Customers shopped late this quarter, which helped us overcome the short selling period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our more basic seasonal mix was a big success, and our sell-through was better than expected. Dollar Tree delivered a consistent sales performance throughout 2002 despite an unsteady retail environment." For 2002, sales totaled $2.33 billion, a 17.1% increase from last year's $1.99 billion; comparable-store sales for the year rose 1%, and for the quarter declined 0.3%. On January 6, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved a switch from a calendar year to a traditional retail fiscal calendar, effective for the fiscal year beginning February 2, 2003. This change better aligns the Company's reporting periods with its new supply-chain management systems. Later today, the Company will be filing an 8-K that presents the first three quarters of 2002 on the new fiscal calendar basis; later this year, the Company expects to file an 8-K presenting its fiscal fourth quarter of 2002, which will include the transition period of January 1, 2003 through February 1, 2003. The first fiscal quarter of 2003, which runs from February 2 through May 3, includes Easter. The Company anticipates fiscal first quarter sales will be in the range of $590 to $610 million. For fiscal 2003, the Company plans to grow its retail selling square footage by 22%, in-line with previous guidance. Most of the 2003 square footage growth should occur during the first three quarters. The Company is targeting sales and earnings growth to exceed 15% in fiscal 2003. In other news, Dollar Tree's Board of Directors unanimously appointed a new member, Eileen R. Scott, to the Company's Board. Scott currently serves as CEO for Pathmark Stores, Inc., of Carteret, N.J. Prior to being named CEO, she served as Pathmark's Executive Vice President of Store Operations, and has held various senior level merchandising and operations positions during her 33-year career at Pathmark. Ms. Scott's appointment brings the size of Dollar Tree's Board to nine. "The Board is excited to welcome a person of Eileen's character and professionalism," Brock commented. "She brings with her a wealth of operational and management experience in the consumer products retail business. Her career at Pathmark is remarkable, rising literally from cashier to CEO. She will bring a fresh perspective to Dollar Tree's expansion plans and operational focus." On Thursday, January 23, 2003, the Company will release its quarterly earnings results and host a conference call to discuss those results at 4:45 p.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 610-769-8817, passcode DLTR.
