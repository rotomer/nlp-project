EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE DOLLAR TREE STORES, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.29 CHESAPEAKE, Va. - May 29, 2003 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported first quarter 2003 earnings per share of $0.29, a 16% increase compared to $0.25 in last year's fiscal first quarter ended April 30, 2002. As previously reported, sales for the fiscal first quarter, which spanned February 2, 2003 to May 3, 2003, were $615.6 million, exceeding the Company's original guidance of $590-610 million. Total sales increased 20.8% quarter-over-quarter, and comparable-store sales rose 2.2%. "Easter sales exceeded our expectations," said CEO Macon Brock, Jr., "and new-store performance has been above plan. These larger stores allow us to better serve our customers with a mix of popular seasonal and everyday merchandise that generates strong consumer loyalty and repeat visits to our stores. We are extremely pleased to start the year off with such positive sales and earnings results." For the first quarter, gross margin was 35.4% compared to 36.2% in last year's quarter. Last year's gross margin benefited from shrink adjustments made in connection with our supply-chain implementation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved to 26.5% in the first quarter of 2003 compared to 27.2% in the same quarter last year. This performance was driven primarily by improvements in payroll and related costs, somewhat offset by higher depreciation expense. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which consolidated four distribution centers on the Company's financial statements. These distribution centers previously were accounted for as operating leases. As a result of adopting FIN 46, this quarter's results include approximately $2 million of additional pre-tax expense. Since the beginning of the year, Dollar Tree commenced operations at its new Marietta, Oklahoma distribution center, and broke ground on two new distribution centers (one in Ridgefield, Washington; the other in Joliet, Illinois). The Company also recently announced it has signed a binding agreement to acquire Greenbacks, Inc., for approximately $100 million. As of May 15, 2003, Greenbacks operates a chain of 96 dollar stores, and is based in Salt Lake City, Utah. At 4:45 p.m. EDT on Thursday, May 29, 2003, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results. The telephone number for the call is (630) 395-0019, passcode DLTR. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Tuesday, June 3 and may be accessed by dialing (402) 998-1102, passcode DLTR. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Tuesday, June 3. Any financial and statistical information related to the call can be accessed through the "About Us / News Releases" section of Dollar Tree's website. For the second quarter, the Company is planning sales to be in the range of $575-$590 million (excluding Greenbacks), with the mid-point of that range equating to roughly flat comparable-store sales. This year's fiscal second quarter contains 91 days, compared to 92 days in last year's second period. The Company's regular, pre-recorded sales update will be available Monday, July 7, 2003, by 5:30 p.m. EDT, and will remain on-line through Friday, July 11, 2003. Interested parties can access the Company's update by dialing (757) 321-5TRE. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. operates 2,319 stores in 41 states as of May 3, 2003. During the first fiscal quarter of 2003, the Company opened 55 stores, closed 8 stores and expanded or relocated 30 stores. At May 3, 2003, the Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 13.9 million, a 4.9% increase from February 1, 2003 and a 27.5% increase compared to a year ago.
