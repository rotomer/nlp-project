DATE: August 7, 2003

CHESAPEAKE, Va. - August 7, 2003 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported second-quarter 2003 sales of $626.0 million, on a comparable-store sales gain of 5.1%.
Exhibit 99.1
Total sales increased 22.2% compared to $512.4 million in last year's reported fiscal second quarter, and exceeded the Company's recently raised guidance of $600-$615 million. These results include approximately $12 million of sales from Greenbacks, the 100-store, Salt Lake City based chain that Dollar Tree acquired on June 29, 2003. Additionally, this year's second quarter included 91 days, compared to 92 days in last year's quarter.
"Our sales performance in the second quarter was exceptional," said CEO Macon Brock, Jr. "Momentum that started with a strong Easter carried through to Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day, and July 4. Our in-stock position on summer basics was excellent. In addition to this everyday merchandise, customers were especially attracted to the large assortment of high-value, brand-name closeouts we offered. We remain well-positioned to deliver on the sales and earnings growth targets we set for the year."
th
The Company expects its gross margin for the second quarter will be approximately 35.2%, in-line with previous guidance. Improvements in operating expenses are expected to be offset by higher depreciation. As a result, SG&A, as a percent of sales, is expected to be approximately the same as the 27.7% in last year's comparable quarter.
Sales for the first half of 2003 totaled $1,241.6 million, a 21.5% year-on-year increase. Those results reflect a comparable-store sales gain of 3.8%.
The Company is planning fiscal third-quarter sales to be in the range of $665-$680 million, based on square footage growth similar to the second quarter's 36%. This expectation is predicated on a comparable-store sales range of flat to slightly up. The Company expects to end the fiscal year with square footage growth of 28%.
On Tuesday, August 26, 2003, the Company will release its second-quarter earnings results and host a conference call to discuss those results at 4:45 p.m. EDT. The telephone number for the call is 610-769-8817, and reference Dollar Tree Stores. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Friday, August 29, and may be accessed by dialing 402-998-1125, reference Dollar Tree Stores. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Friday, August 29.
The Company operated 2,468 stores in 47 states as of August 2, 2003. During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the Company opened 61 stores, closed 12 stores, added 100 Greenbacks stores, and expanded or relocated 35 stores. The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 15.7 million at August 2, 2003, a 13% increase from 13.9 million at May 3, 2003 and a 36% increase compared to a year ago.
