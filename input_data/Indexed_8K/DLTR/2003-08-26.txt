Today, August 26, 2003, Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. issued a press release reporting its fiscal second quarter earnings results and announcing that it will hold a publicly available telephone conference call to discuss these results. The text and the tables appearing in the press release are included below.
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 26, 2003  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported second quarter 2003 earnings per share of $0.25, a 19% increase compared to $0.21 in last year's fiscal second quarter.
"Our outstanding merchandise and focus on brand-name products, along with great store-level execution helped us achieve strong sales and earnings growth for the quarter," said CEO Macon Brock, Jr. "Sales exceeded our forecast in part because of the growing base of larger-size stores which carry a wider assortment of high-quality merchandise. In addition, improving consumer confidence and economic conditions helped drive additional foot traffic to our stores."
As previously reported, sales for the fiscal second quarter were $626.0 million, exceeding the Company's original guidance of $575-590 million. Total sales increased 22.2% quarter-over-quarter, and comparable-store sales rose 5.1%.
On June 29, 2003, Dollar Tree acquired Greenbacks, a Salt Lake City-based dollar-store chain. Greenbacks contributed $12 million in second-quarter sales.
Our integration of Greenbacks is proceeding on-plan," Brock said, "and we recently began operating these stores on Sundays. We are on-track to achieve our sales plan, and we are excited about the opportunities we see to improve these stores' margin."
For the second quarter, gross margin was 35.3% compared to 35.7% in last year's second quarter, reflecting a greater mix of basic merchandise, consolidation of our synthetic leases, and the inclusion of Greenbacks' lower-margin sales for the final five weeks of the quarter. Partially offsetting these effects, strong comparable-store sales provided leverage on occupancy and distribution costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.7% in the second quarter of 2003, equal to the same quarter last year. This performance, in-line with previous expectations, was driven primarily by improvements in payroll and related costs, offset by higher depreciation expense, due to investments in stores, infrastructure, and point-of-sale systems.
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted FIN 46  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which consolidated four distribution centers on the Company's financial statements. These distribution centers previously were accounted for as operating leases. As a result of adopting FIN 46, this quarter's results include approximately $2 million of additional pre-tax expense.
Sales for the first half of 2003 totaled $1.24 billion, a 21.5% increase from the first half of 2002. Those results reflect a comparable-store sales increase of 3.9%. First half earnings per share were $0.54, a 17% increase compared to $0.46 in last year's first half.
For the third quarter, the Company is planning sales to be in the range of $665-$680 million, with the mid-point of that range equating to slightly positive same-store sales. This year's fiscal third quarter contains 91 days, compared to 92 days in last year's third period. The Company's regular, pre-recorded sales update will be available Tuesday, October 7, 2003, by 5:00 p.m. EDT, and will remain on-line through Friday, October 11, 2003. Interested parties can access the Company's update by dialing (757) 321-5TRE.
Entering the year, the Company's guidance was for sales and earnings growth of at least 15%. Based on above-plan first-half results and the addition of Greenbacks, the Company is raising its guidance. The Company now expects sales and earnings growth to be at least 19% for fiscal 2003. This guidance is predicated on slightly positive comparable-store sales increases, and accretion from Greenbacks of 2-3 cents per share in the second half of fiscal 2003.
The Company will host a conference call today, August 26, 2003, at 4:45p.m. EDT to discuss its second-quarter results. The telephone number for the call is 610-769-8817, please reference Dollar Tree Stores. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Friday, August 29, and may be accessed by dialing 402-998-1125, reference Dollar Tree Stores. A web cast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Friday, August 29. Any financial and statistical information related to the call can be accessed through the "About Us / News Releases" section of Dollar Tree's website.
The Company operated 2,468 stores in 47 states as of August 2, 2003. During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the Company opened 61 stores, closed 12 stores, added 100 Greenbacks stores, and expanded or relocated 35 stores. The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 15.7 million at August 2, 2003, a 13% increase from 13.9 million at May 3, 2003 and a 36% increase compared to a year ago.
