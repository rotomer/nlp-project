ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Net sales for the second quarter of 2003 were $626 million, representing a 22% increase over second quarter 2002. Our comparable store net sales increased 5.1% quarter over quarter; this increase was primarily attributed to increased foot traffic in our stores. Gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 35.3%, as a percentage of net sales, compared to 35.7% for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2002. This decline was primarily attributable to the following: These factors were partially offset by leverage on fixed occupancy and distribution costs, provided by our 5.1% comparable store net sales for the second quarter of 2003. As expected, Greenbacks did not contribute significant income to our second quarter results. Greenbacks integration expenses in the second quarter totaled approximately $300,000. Cash and investments of $100 million and inventory levels of $513.3 million, as of the end of the second quarter, were better than plan. Included in our inventory balance was approximately $25.5 million related to Greenbacks. Intangibles, net at the end of the second quarter includes goodwill of approximately $36.8 million related to our Dollar Bills acquisition and $80.6 million related to the Greenbacks acquisition. Our August net sales are tracking on plan. Based on our above-plan first-half 2003 results and the addition of Greenbacks, we expect our net sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year to be at least 19%, based on slightly positive comparable store net sales. We expect to achieve a 28% selling square footage growth for the current fiscal year. We expect selling square footage growth for third quarter of 2003 to be approximately 36% and the fourth quarter to be approximately 28% compared to the same periods in 2002.
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The following summarizes information discussed in Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.s publicly available telephone conference call on August 26, 2003, regarding its fiscal second quarter 2003 earnings results.

Such information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

Outlook
We expect our gross margin in the third quarter of 2003 to be lower than last year's fiscal third quarter of 36.8%, while we expect our fourth quarter of 2003 gross margin to be higher than last year's fiscal fourth quarter of 36.1%. For fiscal year 2003, our gross margin will approximate 36%, as a percentage of net sales. Our long-term gross margin guidance continues to be 36%-37%, as a percentage of net sales.
We expect Greenbacks' merchandise margin to improve; however, the full effect of its margin improvements will be realized in fiscal 2004.
We expect a slight improvement in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second half of 2003, primarily in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period last year.
We continue to expect slight increases in depreciation as a percentage of net sales during the second half of 2003 and fiscal year 2004 due to the continued installation of point-of-sale systems in our stores. We believe these non-cash expenses will plateau, as a percentage of net sales, in 2005 or 2006.
As a result of our brand-marketing tests conducted this spring, we believe that some form of advertising will be in our future. In determining how much marketing we will use, we will focus on net sales growth and the return on our marketing costs.
In fiscal 2004, our focus will be on:
Growth
We plan to finish the year with approximately 50-70 race track format stores (17,000-25,000 average gross square feet).
We expect to convert 40 Greenbacks stores to our signage and fixtures in fiscal 2003, with the remaining stores being converted by mid-year fiscal 2004.
