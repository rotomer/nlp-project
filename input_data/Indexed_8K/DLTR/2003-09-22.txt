Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. Today, September 22, 2003, Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. issued a press release reaffirming its revenue guidance and announcing that its operations were largely unaffected by Hurricane Isabel. The text of the press release is included below. PRESS RELEASE DOLLAR TREE STORES REAFFIRMS REVENUE GUIDANCE, OPERATIONS LARGELY UNAFFECTED BY HURRICANE ISABEL CHESAPEAKE, Va. - September 22, 2003 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported today that its stores, distribution centers, and headquarters building are up-and-running, in the aftermath of Hurricane Isabel. The Company today is reaffirming its standing guidance for third-quarter revenue to be in the range of $665 to $680 million, with the mid-point of that range representing a slightly positive comparable-store increase. In preparation for Hurricane Isabel, the Company carried out various disaster-preparedness plans, including remotely locating help-desk associates to provide technology assistance to stores, advancing store deliveries in order to ship merchandise ahead of the storm, and shipping additional quantities of essential supplies to stores in affected areas. Although the storm temporarily disrupted business and distribution in certain mid-Atlantic areas, stores and distribution centers outside the mid-Atlantic region were unaffected by the hurricane. Fewer than 100 stores lost power during the storm, and none of the Company's stores or distribution centers suffered meaningful property damage from the storm. "I am so proud of how our associates company-wide worked together to provide exceptional service during this time of great need," President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Sasser said. "The emergency measures we implemented worked well: Our associates stayed safe, we had limited disruption to our business, and we had a quick recovery to normal business. We are providing our customers exactly what they need in these challenging times - value, convenience, and merchandise to help them live their lives." On Wednesday, October 8, 2003, the Company will be holding its 3rd annual investor conference. The conference will be webcast live on our website, www.dollartree.com, and will remain available for one week following the conference. The Company operated 2,468 stores in 47 states as of August 2, 2003. During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the Company opened 61 stores, closed 12 stores, added 100 Greenbacks stores, and expanded or relocated 35 stores. The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 15.7 million at August 2, 2003, a 13% increase from 13.9 million at May 3, 2003 and a 36% increase compared to a year ago.
