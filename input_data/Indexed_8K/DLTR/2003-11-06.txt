Exhibit 99
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 6, 2003  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for the fiscal third quarter of $665.2 million, in-line with company guidance, and an increase of 19.4% over $556.9 million reported in last year's fiscal third quarter. Third quarter this year represents 91 days, August 3, 2003 through November 1, 2003, compared to 92 days in last year's third quarter, August 1, 2002 through October 31, 2002.
Sales in comparable stores increased 1.7% in this year's fiscal third quarter. Year-to-date total sales through the end of the fiscal third quarter totaled $1.91 billion, an increase of 20.8% over last year, and an increase in comparable-store sales of 3.2%.
"Our sales for the quarter were on plan, and we are encouraged to see the retail sales environment steadily improving," said Chairman and CEO Macon Brock. "Business was consistent throughout the quarter, and our sell-through of Halloween merchandise was excellent. Our stores are now themed for the holidays, well-stocked with exciting seasonal product and high-value everyday basics. We are ready for the fourth quarter."
As a result of improvements in merchandise margin, shrink, and markdowns, the Company expects its gross margin for the third quarter to be above plan, at approximately 36.5% to 36.75%, with operating income margin approaching 9%.
The Company projects total sales in fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $880-$905 million, based on year-ending square footage growth of 28% and two fewer days in this year's fourth quarter. The mid-point of this sales range equates to slightly positive comparable-store sales growth. Additionally, the Company expects improvements in gross margin and SG&A for the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, resulting in operating income margin of approximately 14.5% to 15.0%.
On Tuesday, November 25, 2003, the Company will release its third-quarter earnings results and host a conference call to discuss those results at 4:45 p.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 610-769-8817, and reference DLTR. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Friday, November 28, and may be accessed by dialing 402-998-0929, reference DLTR. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Friday, November 28.
