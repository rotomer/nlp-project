   EXHIBIT 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 25, 2003  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported earnings per share of $0.31 for the fiscal third quarter ended November 1, 2003, compared to $0.27 in last year's fiscal third quarter.
"Dollar Tree has produced impressive sales and earnings increases each quarter this year," said CEO Macon Brock, Jr. "I believe we are well-positioned to sustain this momentum. Our use of supply-chain systems to improve our efficiency is helping us manage our business, and I believe we will see continued benefits from these initiatives in the future. Our preparations for the upcoming Christmas season were well planned this year, and we are poised for a good fourth quarter."
For the third quarter, gross margin was 36.6%, compared to 36.8% in last year's third quarter, and reflects improvements in merchandise margin, markdowns, and shrink, more than offset by higher freight costs, the consolidation of our synthetic leases and the inclusion of Greenbacks' lower-margin sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.5% in the third quarter of 2003, an improvement compared to 27.6% in the same quarter last year. This performance was driven primarily by improvements in labor productivity and related costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense associated with investments in stores, infrastructure, and point-of-sale systems.
Operating margin in this year's third quarter exceeded plan at 9.1%, and compares to 9.2% in last year's third quarter.
Sales for the first three quarters of 2003 totaled $1.91 billion, a 21% increase from the same period of 2002. Those results reflect a comparable-store sales increase of 3.2%. Earnings per share for the first three quarters of 2003 were $0.85, compared to $0.73 in the year-ago period.
For the fourth quarter, the Company's guidance is for sales to be in the range of $880-$905 million, based on year-ending square footage growth of 28% and slightly positive comparable-store sales. This year's fiscal fourth quarter contains 91 days, compared to 93 days in last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter operating margin is expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, above last year's fourth quarter of 14.0%.
For fiscal 2004, each of the Company's quarterly reporting periods will contain 91 days, the same as fiscal 2003. Year-ending square footage is expected to increase 20%, with the majority of that growth occurring in the first three quarters. Total sales for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.2 to $3.3 billion, based on a slightly positive comparable-store sales increase. For first quarter, the Company anticipates total sales to be in the range of $700 to $720 million. Fiscal 2004 operating margin is expected to improve modestly. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $230-$250 million.
