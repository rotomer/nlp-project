ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The following summarizes information discussed in Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.'s publicly available telephone conference call on November 25, 2003 regarding its fiscal third quarter 2003 earnings results.
The information contained in this item is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Net sales
Net sales for the third quarter of 2003 were $665 million, representing a 19.4% increase over third quarter 2002. Our comparable store net sales increased 1.7% quarter over quarter. While this year's third fiscal quarter contains one less day than the reported prior year quarter, our comparable store net sales are based on the same number of days, 91 days. The pace of business was consistent through all three months of the third quarter of 2003 and our core 10,000-15,000 square foot stores continue to be our better performers. As of November 1, 2003, 792 of our stores, totaling 51% of our square footage, were over 10,000 square feet.
Gross margin
Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 36.6% compared to 36.8% for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2002. This decline is primarily attributable to the following:
These factors were partially offset by improved merchandise margin as a result of better buying and timing. Shrink and markdown results were also better than expected. The effect of these improvements, part of which could be attributed to first and second quarter 2003 results, was approximately 55 basis points.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter were 27.5% of net sales compared to 27.6% of net sales for the same period last year. This decline was primarily attributed to improved labor productivity, benefits from our new supply chain systems and improved store operating costs. The decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation expense associated with our investments in new and expanded stores, distribution center infrastructure, and technological assets.
Outlook
Our November 2003 net sales are tracking on plan. We expect fourth quarter sales to be approximately $880-$905 million, with the midpoint of the range representing slightly positive comparable store net sales of 0.5% to 1.25%. This year's fourth quarter contains 91 days compared with last year's fourth quarter which had 93 days.
We expect our operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2003 to be approximately 50-100 basis points better than last year's fourth quarter of 14%. We believe that the expected improvement will be primarily attributed to the following:
We continue to expect slight increases in depreciation, as a percentage of net sales, during the fourth quarter of 2003 and fiscal year 2004 due to the continued installation of point-of-sale systems in our stores. We believe these non-cash expenses will plateau, as a percentage of net sales, by 2006.
In fiscal year 2004, we expect net sales and earnings growth in the 15%-20% range. We also expect net sales of approximately $3.2-$3.3 billion and modest improvement, in the range of 10-20 basis points, in operating margin. First quarter 2004 net sales are expected to be in the range of $700-$720 million.
Although we expect freight rates to increase in 2004 over 2003, we believe the increase will be offset by improvements in other areas of gross margin and, therefore, we do not expect a significant impact on our overall gross margin.
In fiscal 2004, we plan to launch a check verification system that we expect will enable us to reduce our check loss expense. In addition, with the recent installation of a financial switch to host our debit and credit transactions, we expect we will be able to reduce our associated interchange and banking transaction fees. We expect overall cost savings from these two projects to be approximately $1.3 million. We also expect that there will be some labor cost benefit as a result of the transaction times getting shorter.
Our fiscal 2004 marketing goals include continuing to use broadcast and print media to support grand openings, build brand awareness especially in new markets, increase customer traffic and showcase unique products and highlight seasonal offerings. We will focus on monitoring our return on marketing expenses with the goal of reducing selling, general and administrative expenses while spending on marketing.
Our square footage growth is expected to be approximately 20% in 2004. This growth plan includes more than 200 net new stores and more than 100 relocated and expanded stores. We plan capital expenditures to be $230-$250 million, similar to 2003, in fiscal 2004 and our focus will be on our new and expanded stores, distribution center infrastructure, and continued technology investments. We have approximately 1,645 point-of-sale stores and expect to convert virtually all remaining stores that will benefit from this technology by the end of 2004.
We will begin receiving merchandise in our new Ridgefield, Washington distribution center in December 2003 and shipping merchandise from this distribution center to our stores in the first fiscal quarter of 2004. Our Joliet, Illinois distribution center is expected, as planned, to open in mid-year 2004. In fiscal 2005, we expect to begin an expansion project at our Briar Creek, Pennsylvania distribution center.
