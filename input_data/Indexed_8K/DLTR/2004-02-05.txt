EXHIBIT 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  February 5, 2004  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal fourth quarter were $893.1 million, in-line with Company guidance, and a 14.7% increase over the $778.9 million reported in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter contained 91 days, November 2, 2003 through January 31, 2004, compared to 93 days in last year's fourth quarter, November 1, 2002 through February 1, 2003.
Comparable-store sales increased 1.6% in this year's fiscal fourth quarter. For the year, sales totaled $2.8 billion, an 18.7% increase over last year, on comparable-store sales growth of 2.9%.
"Another solid sales performance capped off a strong year," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. "All three months of the fourth quarter were consistent with our expectations, with each month showing positive comparable-store sales. As we expected, holiday business came late, with strong sales throughout the second half of December."
The Company today reaffirms its guidance for operating margin to improve from 14.0% in last year's fourth quarter to a range of 14.5%-15.0% in this year's fourth quarter.
As previously announced, the Company's expectations for fiscal 2004 are as follows: For the fiscal first quarter, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $700-$720 million, predicated on square footage growth of approximately 28% compared to first quarter 2003 and comparable-store sales growth of slightly positive to 3%. For the full year, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $3.2-$3.3 billion, predicated on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth similar to that expected for the fiscal first quarter.
