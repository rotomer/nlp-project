Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  February 24, 2004  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported earnings per share of $0.69 for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004.
"We are pleased with our fourth-quarter results," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. "A great assortment of high-value merchandise and consistent store-level execution resulted in achievement of our sales forecast and sales strength throughout the quarter. Our gross margin improved significantly over last year and our expenses were well-managed, which resulted in strong earnings growth."
For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 37.0%, compared to 36.1% in last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improvements in markdowns and shrink. Markdowns, and to some degree shrink, benefited from the use of supply-chain systems, which improved information and controls. In addition, modest improvements in other gross margin components were offset by an increase in occupancy expense, which was pressured by two fewer selling days in this year's quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to 22.1% in the same quarter last year; this primarily reflects the higher depreciation expenses associated with investments in larger stores, and technology, especially point-of-sale conversions.
Operating margin in this year's fourth quarter was in-line with plan at 14.7%, and compares favorably to 14.0% in last year's fourth quarter.
"Our seasonal merchandise sell-through was excellent," Sasser added, "and our inventory is clean and well-positioned for a strong start to the new year. Our solid financial position and strong cash flow enable us to continue funding our new-store growth with internally generated capital."
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of its common stock, for $38.7 million, under an existing $200 million authorization approved by its Board of Directors in November 2002.
For the year, sales totaled $2.8 billion, an 18.7% increase year-over-year, on comparable-store sales growth of 2.9%. Operating margin of 10.5% was the same as last year's. Earnings per share were $1.54.
As previously announced, the Company estimates sales for the first quarter to be in the range of $700-$720 million, predicated on square footage growth of approximately 28% (including the Greenbacks acquisition, which took place on June 29, 2003) and comparable-store sales growth of slightly positive to 3%. For the full year, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $3.2-$3.3 billion, predicated on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth similar to that expected for the first quarter. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $200-$210 million for the year.
On Tuesday, February 24, 2004, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 4:45 p.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 610-769-8817, and reference DLTR.
