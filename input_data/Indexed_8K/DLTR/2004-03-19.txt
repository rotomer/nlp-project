In other news, on March 5, 2004, Dollar Tree closed on a $450 million revolving debt facility. Approximately $250 million is drawn against this facility, with $143 million of the proceeds being used to refinance four distribution centers that previously were financed under a synthetic lease facility. The new revolving debt facility provides Dollar Tree with an attractive borrowing rate over a five-year term. As a result of entering into this transaction, the Company will incur financing fees of approximately $1 million in the first quarter of 2004.
Additionally, on February 2, 2004, Dollar Tree's Ridgefield, Washington distribution center began serving stores in the northwestern portions of the United States. This 665,000 square foot, fully automated distribution center is the ninth in Dollar Tree's nationwide network, and was completed on-time and under-budget.
Dollar Tree also will be celebrating the milestone of 2,000 point-of-sale (POS) scanning stores. This project began as a pilot of 10 stores in the first quarter of 2001. Based on the success of that initial pilot, the Company began a more rapid rollout of this inventory-management technology, with POS in 162 stores at the end of 2001, 853 stores at the end of 2002, and 1,771 stores at the end of fiscal 2003.
As of January 31, 2004, Dollar Tree operated 2,513 stores in 47 states. The Company also operates a coast-to-coast logistics network of nine distribution centers. Dollar Tree is a member of the NASDAQ 100 index.
