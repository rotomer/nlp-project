Exhibit 99.1 Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. Reports Record First Quarter Earnings Per Share Of $0.31; Company Reaffirms Second Quarter and Full Year Guidance CHESAPEAKE, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 26, 2004--Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported record first-quarter earnings per share of $0.31 for the period ended May 1, 2004. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $710.3 million, a 15.4% year-over-year increase. "We are using our supply-chain systems to drive incremental improvements throughout the organization," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. "Our inventory controls are better, and the flow of product into the distribution centers and stores is much improved over last year. Point-of-sale data is allowing us to put more of the right product into the stores, and replenish basic and seasonal goods in a timely manner. Lower markdowns, improved shrink, and better inventory management are tangible benefits that we saw this quarter." Gross margin was 35.4%, equal to last year's first quarter. Increased purchases of lower margin domestic goods and loss of leverage on fixed occupancy costs were offset by improvements in shrink and markdowns. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.1%, compared to 26.5% in the same quarter last year. Depreciation expense, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.25% compared to last year's first quarter, due to investments in stores, supply-chain technology, and continued point-of-sale conversions. Loss of leverage on operating expenses was partially offset by improvements in payroll and related expenses. In November 2002, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company bought approximately 700,000 shares of its common stock, for $20.9 million. Cumulative repurchases against the $200 million authorization now stand at approximately $59 million. As previously announced, the Company estimates sales for the second quarter to be in the range of $700-$715 million, based on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth of flat to slightly positive. Pre-tax profit margin for the quarter is expected to be at least 7.0%. For the full year, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $3.2-$3.3 billion, based on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth of slightly positive to 3%. The Company continues to expect earnings growth of at least 14% compared to last year. On Wednesday, May 26, 2004, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 4:45 p.m. EDT. The telephone number for the call is 703-464-5612. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Monday, May 31, and may be accessed by dialing 703-925-2533, and the access code is 461114.
