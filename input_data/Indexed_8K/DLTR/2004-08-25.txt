Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 25, 2004  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported second-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.26 for the period ended July 31, 2004. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $704.2 million, a 12.5% year-over-year increase.
 
"I am pleased with our gross margin performance and our ability to manage store expenses," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. "Against our toughest quarterly sales comparison, and in a challenging economic environment for our middle-income customers, our store and merchandise teams have positioned us well for the all-important second-half of the year."
 
Gross margin for the second quarter was 35.3%, equal to last year's second quarter. Improvement in net merchandise margin was offset by the deleveraging of occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.3%, compared to 27.7% in the same quarter last year. As previously announced, SG&A expenses include a $1.1 million lease loss charge associated with the closure and replacement of the Company's Woodridge, Illinois distribution center. Depreciation expense, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.37% compared to last year's second quarter, due to investments in stores, supply-chain technology and continued point-of-sale conversions.
 
Sales for the first half of fiscal 2004 total $1,414.6 million, a 13.9% increase compared to $1,241.6 million in the comparable year-ago period. Earnings per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2004 are $0.57, which compares to $0.54 in last year's first half.
 
As previously announced, the Company estimates sales for the third quarter to be in the range of $730-$750 million, based on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth of flat to slightly positive. For the full year, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $3.15-$3.2 billion, based on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth of flat to slightly positive. The Company now expects fiscal year 2004 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.65-$1.73.
 
Dollar Tree celebrated several significant milestones during the second quarter. In June, the Company completed the build-out of its national distribution network, with the opening of its state-of-the-art distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. In July, the Company opened its first store in North Dakota, becoming the first and only dollar store chain with a true national presence in all 48 contiguous states.
 
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 417,000 shares of its common stock under a $200 million authorization granted by its Board of Directors in November 2002. Through July 31, 2004, cumulative repurchases under this authorization total approximately $70 million.
 
On Wednesday, August 25, 2004, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 4:45 p.m. EDT. The telephone number for the call is 703-464-5614.
