   EXHIBIT 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 4, 2004  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal third quarter were a record $724.0 million, compared to $665.2 million in last year's fiscal third quarter. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 0.7%, in-line with the company's previous guidance. For the year-to-date period, comparable store sales increased 0.2%.
"We opened fewer stores than planned in the third quarter," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. We fully expect all of those stores will be open and ready for holiday business, and therefore achieve our announced 20% square footage growth prior to Thanksgiving."
For the third quarter, the Company expects earnings per share to be approximately 28 cents, including approximately one cent per share, or $2 million pre-tax of expenses for hurricane- and flood-related store and inventory damages.
For the fourth quarter, the Company estimates sales to be in the range of $990 million to $1,010 million, based on square footage growth of approximately 20% and comparable-store sales growth of flat to slightly positive. Based on this level of sales, the Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80-$0.82 for the fourth quarter and $1.65-$1.67 for the year.
On Tuesday, November 23, 2004, the Company will release its third-quarter earnings results and host a conference call to discuss those results at 9:00 a.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1152. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Monday, November 29, and may be accessed by dialing 703-925-2533, and the access code is 590362. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Monday, November 29.
Dollar Tree operated 2,674 stores in 48 states as of October 30, 2004, compared to 2,511 stores in 47 states a year ago. During the third fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company opened 65 stores, closed 3 stores, and expanded or relocated 38 stores. The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 19.6 million at October 30, 2004, an 18.4%increase compared to a year ago.
