EXHIBITS Exhibit 99.1- Press release dated February 23, 2005 issued by Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1 Dollar Tree Reports Record Fourth Quarter Earnings Per Share Of $0.79 CHESAPEAKE, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 23, 2005--Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported earnings per share of $0.79, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005, an increase of $0.10 per share over fiscal fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004. Included in the results of the quarter just ended is $0.02 per share for a one-time tax benefit. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $987.5 million, a 10.6% increase compared to $893.1 million, for the same period, one year ago. "Much was accomplished during 2004," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. "We improved our control over variable expenses and invested in infrastructure to support our future growth, including the completion of our POS installation and the addition of two new distribution centers during the year. Our balance sheet and our cash flow from operations are strong. We ended 2004 with nearly $320 million in cash and investments, and we believe that we are well positioned in 2005 to better serve our customers, achieve profitable growth, and deliver value to our shareholders." For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 36.3%, down from 37.0% in last year. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of higher inbound freight costs, deleveraging of occupancy costs, and a higher level of markdowns associated with clearing and valuing seasonal goods. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 21.9% in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 22.3% in the same quarter last year; this primarily reflects a decrease in payroll costs, expressed as a percentage of sales, and our ongoing efforts to reduce operating costs and control expenses. Operating margin in this year's fourth quarter was 14.3%, versus 14.7% for the same period, one year ago. For the year, sales totaled $3.126 billion, an 11.6% increase year-over-year, on comparable-store sales growth of 0.5%. Operating margin was 9.7%, versus 10.5% one year ago. Earnings per share were $1.63. The Company estimates sales for the first quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $770-$790 million. Comparable store sales performance is expected to be flat due to the loss of two weeks leading up to the Easter Holiday Season. Based upon this sales forecast, earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.33. For the full year, the Company estimates sales will range from $3.435-$3.535 billion. This estimate is predicated on a square footage growth of 14-16%. Comparable store sales are expected to be in the low single digit range. These estimates are based on the Company's focus on driving store productivity, leveraging technology enhancements, and increasing inventory turns. Earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.77 to $1.87. On Wednesday, February 23, 2005, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1166. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Tuesday, March 1, and may be accessed by dialing 703-925-2533, and the access code is 635162. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Tuesday, March 1. Any financial and statistical information related to the call can be accessed through the "Investor Relations / SEC Filings / Non-GAAP Measures" section of Dollar Tree's website. The Company's regular, pre-recorded business update will be available Thursday, April 7, 2005, by 5:00 p.m. EDT, and will remain on-line through Monday, April 11, 2005.

The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 20.4 million at January 29, 2005, a 21% increase compared to a year ago.
