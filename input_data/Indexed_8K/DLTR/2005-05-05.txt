EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 5, 2005  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal first quarter of 2005 were $749.1 million, a 5.5% increase compared to $710.3 million in last year's fiscal first quarter. These sales results were within the range of the Company's most recent guidance of $740 to $755 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter declined 3.7%.
 
"While comparable store sales were positive for the first nine weeks of the quarter, we were negatively impacted by the earlier Easter holiday and severe weather conditions in various parts of the country," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. "Further, our customers continue to be pressured by higher gasoline prices, which is limiting the number of shopping trips as well as shrinking their disposable income. While we are facing strong head winds in the near term, we expect many of the benefits from our 2005 initiatives, including increased advertising, to be realized in the second half of the year and beyond."
 
Based on the aforementioned first quarter sales, the Company now expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.26.
 
The Company will provide more detailed information about its first quarter 2005 operating results and provide updated guidance for the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2005 during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, May 25, 2005, 9:00 a.m. EDT. The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1319. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Friday, June 4, and may be accessed by dialing 703-925-2533 and the access code is 701625. A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcall's website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Friday, June 4.
