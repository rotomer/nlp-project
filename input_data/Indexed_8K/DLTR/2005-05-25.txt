EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 25, 2005  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.26, for the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, 2005. Sales for the quarter were $749.1 million, a 5.5% increase compared to $710.3 million, for the same period, one year ago. Comparable store sales declined 3.7% for the quarter.
 
"The impact of reduced sales resulting from adverse weather conditions during the shorter pre-Easter selling period were more than could be overcome and is reflected in our earnings," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. "Our customers have experienced and continue to feel the impact of higher fuel costs, and while our guidance anticipates this to continue, we are optimistic that initiatives which were implemented early in the year, including increased marketing and expansion of our tender types, will provide future momentum."
 
For the first quarter, gross margin was 33.9%, compared to the 35.6% in last year's first quarter. The decrease in rate is predominantly attributable to reduced leverage on occupancy costs as the result of lower than planned sales. Additionally, freight costs increased due to higher fuel prices and markdowns were higher than plan due to lower than planned sell through of Easter product.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.5% in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 27.4% in the same quarter last year. The slight increase in rate, despite a 3.7% decline in comparable store sales, reflects a continual focus on expense control as well as initial payback on efforts to reduce operating costs.
 
Operating margin in this year's first quarter was 6.4%, versus 8.3% for the same period, one year ago.
 
During the first quarter of 2005, the Company bought 4.7 million shares of its common stock, for approximately $128.3 million. On March 18, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $300 million share repurchase program. Of the aforementioned shares repurchased, 2.8 million shares were bought under the new authorization, at a total cost of $73.0 million, with the balance repurchased under the former plan.
 
The Company estimates sales for the second quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $755 -$770 million. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.27.
 
For the full year, the Company expects sales will range from $3.340 to $3.415 billion. Based on this sales forecast, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.61 to $1.72. This guidance considers modest improvement in sales trends in the second half of 2005 since many of the initiatives to improve the top line were starting to be implemented in late April and early May.
 
On Wednesday, May 25, 2005, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EDT. The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1319. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Saturday, June 4, and may be accessed by dialing 703-925-2533, and the access code is 701625.

As of April 30, 2005, Dollar Tree operated 2,791 stores in 48 states. During the first quarter, Dollar Tree opened 65 stores, closed 9 stores, and expanded or relocated 30 stores. The Company's retail selling square footage totaled approximately 21.3 million at April 30, 2005, an 18% increase compared to a year ago.
