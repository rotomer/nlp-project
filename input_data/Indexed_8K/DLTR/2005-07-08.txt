Thank you for calling the Dollar Tree business update hotline. This is Kent Kleeberger, Chief Financial Officer.
 
The information on this call about our future expectations, plans and prospects constitutes forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including national and international events, consumer spending, and others described in our recent Annual Report, Current Report, and Quarterly Report on file with the SEC. This information is current only as of the date presented, and we will not update this information until our official quarterly sales release scheduled for Thursday, August 4, before market open.
 
Our previous sales guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, encompassing the reporting period of May 1, 2005 to July 30, 2005, was for total sales to be in the range of $755 to $770 million. As of July 7, the Company's sales may be characterized as in line with guidance, and we are reaffirming that range.
 
As of July 7, 2005, we operated 2,845 stores in 48 states, compared to 2,602 stores in 47 states at July 3, 2004.
 
Thank you for calling.

A WARNING ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:
 
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For example, our forward - looking statements include statements regarding our expectations for second-quarter 2005 sales.

June 9, 2005. Also, carefully review "Risk Factors" in our most recent prospectuses filed November 15, 2000 and August 3, 2000. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the future events, developments or results described by our forward - looking statements in this document could turn out to be materially and adversely different from those we discuss or imply. We are not obligated to release publicly any revisions to any forward - looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report and you should not expect us to do so.
