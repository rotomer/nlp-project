CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 4, 2005  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal second quarter of 2005 were $769.0 million, a 9.2% increase compared to $704.2 million in last year's fiscal second quarter. These sales results were within the range of the Company's most recent guidance of $755 to $770 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter declined 1.5%.
 
"We continue to believe that most of the benefit of our process improvement and 2005 initiatives will be recognized in the second half of the year," President and CEO Bob Sasser said. "While high fuel prices continue to impact our customers and put pressure on our transportation costs, we expect the expansion of our tender types and increased item-focused marketing will have a positive sales impact."
 
The Company now expects diluted earnings per share for the quarter will approximate the low end of the previous guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27.
