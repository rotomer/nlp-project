Exhibit 99.1- Press release dated August 24, 2005 issued by Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 24, 2005  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.25, for the fiscal second quarter ended July 30, 2005. Sales for the quarter were $769.0 million, a 9.2% increase compared to $704.2 million, for the same period, one year ago. Comparable store sales declined 1.5% for the quarter.
 
"An increase in our average ticket was more than offset by reduced store traffic," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. "While we achieved sales within our most recent guidance, it is evident that our customers continue to feel the strain of rising fuel costs, and they are responding with fewer shopping trips. We remain focused on our sales initiatives as we manage all aspects of our business."
 
For the second quarter, gross margin was 34.0%, compared to the 35.6% in last year's second quarter. Loss of leverage on occupancy costs, coupled with higher merchandise costs resulting from mix and higher freight costs attributed to most of the decline. The 2004 second quarter results also included a favorable shrink true-up which accounted for the balance of the rate decline in the year-on-year comparison.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.9% in the second quarter of 2005, compared to 28.6% in the same quarter last year. The reduction in rate reflects the Company's continual dedication to expense control as well as meaningful savings in health care costs and workers compensation expenses.
 
It is also noteworthy that depreciation expense, as a percent of sales, was flat for the quarter, when compared to last year.
 
Operating margin in this year's second quarter was 6.1%, versus 7.0% for the same period, one year ago.
 
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $775 -$800 million. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.31.
 
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $3.33 billion - $3.38 billion. Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.57 - $1.66.
 
On Wednesday, August 24, 2005, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m EDT. The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1163.
