Regulation FD Disclosure.
As previously announced, Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. has released a business update for its third quarter of 2005, which is available via a recorded telephone announcement beginning October 6, 2005 after 5:00 PM EST and continuing through Monday, October 10, 2005. The recorded announcement may be accessed by calling (757) 321-5873.
The text of that recorded announcement is included below:
Thank you for calling the Dollar Tree business update hotline. This is Kent Kleeberger, Chief Financial Officer.
The information on this call about our future expectations, plans and prospects constitutes forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including national and international events, consumer spending, and others described in our recent Annual Report, Current Report, and Quarterly Report on file with the SEC. This information is current only as of the date presented, and we will not update this information until our official quarterly sales release scheduled for Thursday, November 3, before market open.
Our previous sales guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, encompassing the reporting period of July 31, 2005 to October 29, 2005, was for total sales to be in the range of $775 to $800 million. As of October 6, the Companys sales may be characterized as in line with guidance, and we are therefore affirming the range.
While it appears our third quarter sales will not be materially impacted by Hurricane Katrina, and more recently Hurricane Rita, fourteen stores sustained heavy damages as a result of these storms. These damages include inventory losses, leasehold and equipment destruction, and significant structural repairs. The amount of loss is estimated to be in the range of $4.5 to $5.5 million or approximately $0.03 per share, most of which is likely to be incurred in the third quarter. Previous earnings guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2005 should be adjusted accordingly.
 
As of October 6, 2005, we operated 2,884 stores in 48 states, compared to 2,646 stores in 48 states at October 4, 2004.
Thank you for calling.  Good Day.
On October 6, 2005, Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. also issued a press release regarding its business update for the fiscal third quarter 2005 sales results. A copy of the press release is attached to this Form 8-K as and is incorporated herein by this reference.
