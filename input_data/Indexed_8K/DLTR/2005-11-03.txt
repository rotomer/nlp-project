Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - November 3, 2005 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported that total sales for its fiscal third quarter of 2005 were $796.8 million, a 10.0% increase compared to $724.0 million in last years fiscal third quarter. These sales results were within the range of the Companys most recent guidance of $775 to $800 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter declined 1.0%.
Substantially all of the comparable-store sales decline was the result of lower traffic, President and CEO Bob Sasser said. We believe that our initiatives to expand tender types, such as debit card and EBT acceptance, contributed to an increased average ticket, offsetting much of the impact of lower traffic in the 3
rd
quarter. We have just completed the rollout of additional debit stores, in time for holiday shopping, which brings us to over 1,400 stores converted this year. Our inventory is balanced and our stores are well positioned for the fourth quarter business.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its third quarter 2005 operating results and guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Tuesday, November 22, 2005, 9:00 a.m. EST.
The telephone number for the call is 703-639-1307
