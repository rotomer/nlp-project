Exhibit 99.1
 
 

CHESAPEAKE, Va. - November 22, 2005 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading
operator of single-price point dollar stores
, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.29, for the fiscal third quarter ended October 29, 2005. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $796.8 million, a 10.1% increase compared to $724.0 million, for the same period, one year ago. Comparable store sales declined 1.0% for the quarter.
We continued to demonstrate good expense control and inventory management in the third quarter,
President and CEO Bob Sasser said. The productivity of our new, 2005 stores is improved over last years class and, while comparable store sales growth continues to be our challenge, we believe our initiatives to expand tender types have contributed to an increased average ticket, offsetting much of the impact of lower traffic. Further, our stores are well positioned for the Holiday season.
For the third quarter, gross margin was 34.7%, compared to 35.7% in last years third quarter. The decline was driven primarily by a higher mix of lower margin consumer products and the loss of leverage on occupancy costs associated with negative comparable store sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.1% in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 28.3% in the same quarter last year. The improvement in rate reflects the Companys continued focus on expense control, which succeeded in offsetting increased utility costs and charges for the hurricane damages sustained in the third quarter 2005.
Operating margin in this years third quarter was 6.5%, versus 7.4% for the same period in 2004.
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock, for approximately $50 million, which brings the year-to-date total to $180.4 million of funds used to repurchase common stock. On March 18, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program. The Company has approximately $173 million authorization remaining under this program.
The Company also reported that as of today, nine of its locations remain closed because of the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Company expects to reopen three of the nine stores in the near future, permanently close five, and relocate one store.
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $1.035 billion - $1.065 billion. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.80.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $3.350 billion - $3.380 billion. Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.53 - $1.59.
