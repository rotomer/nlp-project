On December 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued, outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans, including the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan, effective as of December 15, 2005.
The Company believes that the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options, almost all of which have exercise prices that are higher than our current stock price, will give employees increased performance incentives and will enhance current retention. The Company also implemented the acceleration program to eliminate non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment (revised 2004), (FAS 123R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. FAS 123R requires recognizing compensation cost for any unvested stock options at the date of adoption over the remaining requisite service period of the options. Currently, the Company accounts for options using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and provides footnote disclosure of the compensation expense associated with stock options. The future expense that will be eliminated as a result of the option acceleration program is estimated to be approximately $15.0 million (before tax) over a period of four years during which the options would have vested. This determination is based on the estimated number of options presently outstanding subject to the acceleration program and is net of an adjustment for estimated forfeiture of certain (in the money) options, for which the company expects to take an immediate charge of approximately $125,000.
 
A WARNING ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, forecast, or estimate. For example, the Companys forward-looking statements include statements regarding its expectation for how the decision to accelerate option vesting will affect future earnings and how it affects employee performance incentives and retention. For a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments or results, you should carefully review the "Risk Factors," "Business," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed April 14, 2005 and the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed December 8, 2005. Also, carefully review "Risk Factors" in our most recent prospectuses filed November 15, 2000 and August 3, 2000. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the future events, developments or results described by our forward-looking statements in this document could turn out to be materially and adversely different from those we discuss or imply. We are not obligated to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report and you should not expect us to do so.
On December 15, 2005, the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. approved the Third Restated By-Laws of the Company. The Third Restated By-Laws are attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and are incorporated herein by this reference.
