Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - February 2, 2006 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal fourth quarter of $1.079 billion, which is above the Companys most recent guidance, and is a 9.3% increase compared to $987.5 million in last years fiscal fourth quarter. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 1.0%.
Sales momentum grew
in the last half of December, as consumers continued to shop closer to need for the Holidays, said Bob Sasser, President and CEO. In addition, our post-Holiday business was strong.
Our average ticket continued to increase in the fourth quarter, offsetting a decline in traffic. The improvement in average ticket was driven by our store merchandising initiatives, better in-stock position, and our expansion of tender types, primarily debit card acceptance, which was in more than two thirds of our stores in time for the Holiday season.
Based on the sales volume achieved in the fourth quarter, the Company anticipates earnings per share for the quarter to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81, which will equal or exceed the high end of our previous guidance of $0.74 to $0.80 per share. The Companys earnings per share were $0.74 in the fourth quarter last year.
For fiscal 2005, sales totaled $3.394 billion, an 8.6% year-over-year increase compared to $3.126 billion last year. Comparable-store sales decreased 0.8% in the current year.
The Company will release
its fourth-quarter earnings results
on Wednesday, February 22, 2006. The Company will also
host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST that day, to discuss the results in detail, and provide insights into its plans for 2006. The telephone number for the call is 703-639
-1375.
A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Friday, March 3, and may be accessed by dialing 703
-925-2533. The access code is 844398
. A webcast of the call will be available through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com, as well as at Vcalls website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Friday, March 3.
