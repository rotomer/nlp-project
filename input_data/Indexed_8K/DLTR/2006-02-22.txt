Exhibit 99.1
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - February 22, 2006 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading
operator of single price point dollar stores
, reported earnings per share of $0.81, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006, an increase of 9.5% from $0.74 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $1.079 billion, a 9.3% increase compared to $987.5 million, for the same period, one year ago.
Fourth Quarter 2005 Commentary
We made progress on key initiatives throughout the year that resulted in improved fourth quarter performance, said President and CEO Bob Sasser. Our merchandise value was outstanding, the flow of inventory was much better this season and our stores were ready for the holidays.
The expansion of payment type was executed seamlessly and we now accept debit cards in over 70% of the chain.
Our Real Estate initiatives combined with the effective execution by our store teams resulted in opening more stores earlier in the year and increased productivity in our new stores.
We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, as we reduced inventory levels and increased cash and investments while repurchasing $180 million of shares during the year.
For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 35.3%, down from 35.5% last year. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of a slight shift to consumables in the merchandise mix and higher freight expense, slightly offset by a lower rate for distribution and occupancy costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to 22.1% in the same quarter last year. The increase in rate reflects an increase in compensation and benefit expense, property taxes, and utilities.
 
Operating margin in this years fourth quarter was 12.6%, versus 13.4% for the same period, one year ago.
For the year, sales totaled $3.394 billion, an 8.6% increase year-over-year, on a comparable store sales decline of 0.8%. Operating margin was 8.3%, versus 9.4% one year ago. Diluted earnings
per share were $1.60.
Deal$ Stores Acquisition
In a press release issued earlier today, the Company announced the pending acquisition of 138 stores and related assets of the Deal$-Nothing Over a Dollar chain, which is owned by SUPERVALU  INC. (NYSE:SVU).
I am excited about the opportunity that this acquisition provides to expand our presence in the Midwest and Southeast regions, said Bob Sasser, President and CEO. We have existing logistics capacity to service all of these stores efficiently with no additional capital expenditure. Furthermore, the Deals acquisition includes a number of combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items selling for more than $1. All Deal$ stores will continue to operate under the Deal$ banner and they will provide an opportunity to leverage the Dollar Tree infrastructure in the development of a multi priced business without disrupting the single price point model in Dollar Tree Stores."

Guidance for 2006
The Company estimates sales for the first quarter of 2006 to be in the range of $845 - $870 million. Comparable store sales performance is expected to be positive low single digit. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31.
For the full year, the Company estimates sales will range from $3.845-$3.940 billion. This estimate is predicated on a square footage growth of 12-14%, which includes 138 Deal$ stores, or about 5% of the annual increase. Comparable store sales performance is projected to be nearly flat to positive low single digits.
Fiscal year 2006 diluted earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.80. These estimates exclude any impact of share repurchase in 2006. The Company has $173 million available to repurchase shares under the original $300 million authorization.
