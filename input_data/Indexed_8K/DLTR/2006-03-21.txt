Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., conducted its annual review of the base salaries and incentive compensation of the Companys executive officers. The Committee determined that, for the 2006 fiscal year, it would not increase salaries and, by extension, potential bonus payouts for these individuals. Instead, each of the Companys Named Executive Officers were granted restricted stock units, the vesting of which are subject to the executives remaining with the Company over a specified period of time and the Company achieving a target level of earnings per share in fiscal 2006.
The following table sets forth the annual base salaries of the Companys Named Executive Officers. The Named Executive Officers were determined by reference to the Companys proxy statement, dated April 29, 2005.
On March 15, 2006, the Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to each of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2005 which ended on January 28, 2006. On the same date, the Committee also established the potential bonus and performance goals for fiscal year 2006. Consistent with past practice, 85% of the potential award is based on the Companys earnings per share and 15% is based on the officer achieving personal performance goals. The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2005 and bonus potential for fiscal 2006:
The bonus potential for fiscal 2006 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its earnings per share goal and the executive achieves 100% of his personal performance goal. If the Company exceeds its earnings per share goal, the executives bonus can exceed the bonus potential set forth above. The bonuses were made pursuant to the Executive Officer Cash Bonus Plan which was approved by the shareholders in 2004.
On March 15, 2006, the Committee granted 1,500 restricted stock units to Bob Sasser and 1,000 restricted stock units to Kent Kleeberger under the Companys Executive Officer Equity Plan approved by the shareholders in 2004. The vesting of the units are subject to the executives remaining with the Company over a specified period of time and the Company achieving a target level of earnings per share in fiscal 2006.
 
On March 15, 2006, the Committee approved the grant, effective March 31, 2006, of 20,000 options and 5,000 restricted stock units to Macon Brock Jr.; 30,000 options and 7,500 restricted stock units to Bob Sasser; and 12,500 options and 3,125 restricted stock units to Kent Kleeberger under the Companys Executive Officer Equity Plan approved by the shareholders in 2004.
