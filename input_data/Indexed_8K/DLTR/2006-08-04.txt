Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - August 3, 2006 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal second quarter of 2006 were $883.6 million, a 14.9% increase compared to $769.0 million in last years fiscal second quarter. These sales results were above the range of the Companys most recent guidance of $855 to $875 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 4.2 %.
Sales growth was consistent throughout the quarter, President and CEO Bob Sasser said. The installation of expanded payment type acceptance and the continued expansion of consumer products in our assortment, especially in the larger stores, are key initiatives that contributed to a higher average sale per customer and increased year over year customer traffic.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its second quarter 2006 operating results and guidance for the third fiscal quarter during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, August 23, 2006, 9:00 a.m. EDT.
