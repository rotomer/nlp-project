Press release dated August 23, 2006 issued by Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - August 23, 2006 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading
operator of single-price point dollar stores
, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.28, for the fiscal second quarter ended July 29, 2006. Sales for the quarter were $883.6 million, a 14.9% increase compared to $769.0 million, for the same period, one year ago. Comparable store sales increased 4.2% for the quarter.
Our sales grew consistently throughout the quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser. Customers have responded positively to our shopping convenience, our extreme merchandise value and our expansion of basic consumer products. Both average ticket and store traffic increased, once again, in the second quarter.
For the second quarter, gross margin was 33.2%, compared to 34.0% in last years second quarter. The decline in rate was primarily due to the planned increase in penetration of lower margin consumables, and increased transportation costs resulting from higher diesel fuel prices relative to last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.8% in the second quarter of 2006, compared to 27.9% in the same quarter last year. Increases in employee benefits and incentives were offset by operating expense control and leverage from positive same store sales. Also, depreciation and amortization, as a percent of sales, declined 30 basis points, for the quarter, when compared to last year.
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company bought approximately 3.4 million shares of its common stock for $88.7 million, resulting in $136.4 million of share repurchase year-to-date.
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2006 to be in the range of $895 - $915 million. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.32.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $3.895 billion - $3.955 billion. Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.74 - $1.82.
