Thank you for calling the Dollar Tree business update hotline. This is Kent Kleeberger, Chief Financial Officer.
The information on this call about our future expectations, plans and prospects constitutes forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including national and international events, consumer spending, and others described in our recent Annual Report, Current Report, and Quarterly Report on file with the SEC. This information is current only as of the date presented, and we will not update this information until our official quarterly sales release scheduled for Thursday, November 2, before market opening.
Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, encompassing the reporting period of July 30, 2006 to October 28, 2006, was for total sales to be in the range of $895 to $915 million. As of October 5, the Companys sales may be characterized as in line with guidance, and we are therefore reaffirming that range of sales.
Again, our official sales release for 3Q 2006 is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2006, before market opening.
As of October 5, 2006, Dollar Tree operated 3,175 stores in 48 states, compared to 2,884 stores in 48 states at October 6, 2005.
