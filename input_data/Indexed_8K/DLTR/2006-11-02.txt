Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - November 2, 2006 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal third quarter of 2006 were $910.4 million, a 14.3% increase compared to $796.8 million in last years fiscal third quarter. These sales results were within the range of the Companys most recent guidance of $895 to $915 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 4.0 %.
The sales momentum that was consistent in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter, President and CEO Bob Sasser said. Comparable-store sales growth benefited from increases in both customer traffic and average ticket. Our Halloween selling season was solid, and our stores are well positioned for the fourth quarter.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its third quarter 2006 operating results and guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Tuesday, November 21, 2006, 9:00 a.m. EST.
