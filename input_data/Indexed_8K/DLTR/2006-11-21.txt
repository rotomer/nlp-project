Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - November 21, 2006 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading
operator of single-price point dollar stores
, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.32, for the fiscal third quarter ended October 28, 2006. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $910.4 million, a 14.3% increase from $796.8 million, for the same period, last year. Comparable store sales increased 4.0% for the quarter.
We continue to have success in generating merchandise excitement through an ever-changing mix of variety and seasonal merchandise, said President and CEO Bob Sasser. The addition of more basic consumable products that are more frequently purchased has contributed to increases in both traffic and ticket for the third consecutive quarter. We finished 3
rd
quarter with a strong Halloween sell through and our stores are well prepared for the Christmas Holiday Season.
For the third quarter, gross margin was 33.8%, compared to 34.7% in last years third quarter. The rate decline was the result of an increased shrink accrual, following the completion of the last 850 store inventories during the quarter, an increase in sales of lower margin consumer goods and the impact of Deal$ stores.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.9% in the third quarter of 2006, compared to 28.1% in the same quarter last year. Increases in incentive compensation and benefits were more than offset by gains arising from early lease terminations and the positive leverage from same store sales.
 
Operating margin in this years third quarter was 5.9%, versus 6.5% for the same period in 2005. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%, reflecting the small impact of one-time tax benefits in certain states.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased three hundred thousand shares of its common stock, for approximately $9.3 million, which brings the year-to-date total to $148.2 million of funds used to repurchase common stock.
 
The Company today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of its common stock. Stock repurchases may be made, from time-to-time, either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, at management's discretion, depending on market conditions and other factors, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. The company has demonstrated the continual ability to self fund store growth and other initiatives, while generating substantial free cash. We believe additional share repurchase is a good use of cash and provides additional benefit to our shareholders, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.
 
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 to be in the range of $1.28 billion - $1.31 billion. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $3.93 billion - $3.96 billion. Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.77 - $1.83.
 
On Tuesday, November 21, 2006, the Company will
host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m EST. The telephone number for the call is 800-289-0572.
