As previously announced, Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. has released a business update for its fourth quarter 2006, which is available via a recorded telephone announcement beginning January 4, 2007 after 5:00 PM EST and continuing through Monday, January 8, 2007.

The text of that recorded announcement is included below:
  
Thank you for calling the Dollar Tree business update hotline. This is Kent Kleeberger, Chief Financial Officer.
 
The information on this call about our future expectations, plans and prospects constitutes forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including national and international events, consumer spending, and other matters described in our recent Annual Report, Current Report, and Quarterly Report on file with the SEC. This information is current only as of the date presented, and we will not update this information until our official quarterly sales release scheduled for Thursday, February 8, before market opening.
Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, encompassing the reporting period of October 29, 2006 to February 3, 2007, was for total sales to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 billion. As of January 4, 2007, the Companys sales may be characterized as near the upper end of that range. As a reminder, these results include an extra week in fiscal January, commensurate with the 53-week retail calendar for fiscal 2006.
Again, our official sales release for 4Q 2006 is scheduled for Thursday, February 8, 2007, before market opening.
As of January 4, 2007, Dollar Tree operated 3,232 stores in 48 states, compared to 2,923 stores in 48 states at January 5, 2006.
