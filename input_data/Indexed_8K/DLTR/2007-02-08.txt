Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - February 8, 2007 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal fourth quarter 2006 of $1.319 billion, a 22.2% increase compared to $1.079 billion in last years fiscal fourth quarter. These sales results are approximately $9 million above the high end of the range of previous guidance. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reflects 14 weeks of sales, commensurate with the 53-week retail calendar, which
contributed approximately $70 million of sales.
Comparable-store sales for the fourteen week quarter increased 5.5%, when compared to fiscal fourth quarter 2005 plus the first week of February 2006. These results reflect a significant improvement when compared to the 1.0% comparable-store sales increase reported for the fourth quarter last year.
Our Christmas season was strong, with improved sell-through, said Bob Sasser, President and CEO. Average ticket and customer traffic increased, driven by our merchandising initiatives, improved in-stock position, as well as our expansion of basic products and tender types.
Our stores executed a quick and successful transition from Christmas to Valentines Day, and inventory is well-positioned for the spring.
For fiscal 2006, sales totaled $3.969 billion, including the 53rd week, a 16.9% year-over-year increase compared to $3.394 billion last year. Comparable-store sales increased 4.6% in the current year, based on a 53 week - to - 53 week comparison.
