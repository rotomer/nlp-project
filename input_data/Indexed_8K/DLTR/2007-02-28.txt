Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - February 28, 2007 - Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading
operator of single price point dollar stores
, reported earnings per share of $0.96, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007, an increase of 18.5% from $0.81 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006. As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $1.319 billion, a 22.2% increase compared to the $1.079 billion, for the same period, one year ago. These results included the extra, fourteenth week, commensurate with the 53-week retail calendar, which accounted for about $70 million in sales.
Business was strong throughout the quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser. Our stores were ready for the holiday season with an amazing assortment of great merchandise and their execution was exceptional. In-store promotions like build a wreath and build a gift basket along with a focused, on-trend assortment of high value seasonal items brought merchandise excitement to our customers. Both traffic and average transaction size increased as we continued to see the benefit of our expansion of tender type acceptance, frozen and refrigerated capability in more stores, and better in stock positions on faster turning basic, everyday variety merchandise.
 
For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 35.7%, a 40 BPS improvement from 35.3% last year. The rate improvement reflects favorable leverage from the extra week of sales and comparable store sales increases, along with a smaller impact from the shift to consumables in the merchandise mix, relative to recent quarters.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 23.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 22.6% in the same quarter last year. The increase in rate reflects higher field sales bonuses, incentive compensation and benefit expenses as well as a planned increase in advertising spend.
 
Operating margin in this years fourth quarter was 11.8%, versus 12.7% for the same period, one year ago.
For the year, sales totaled $3.969 billion, a 16.9% increase year-over-year, on a comparable store sales increase of 4.6%. Operating margin was 7.8%, versus 8.4% one year ago. Diluted earnings
per share were $1.85.
We generated significant free cash flow in 2006 and expended about $248 million for share repurchases, including $100 million through an accelerated share repurchase in the fourth quarter, said Mr. Sasser. We ended the year with over $300 million in cash and investments.
The Company estimates sales for the first quarter of 2007 to be in the range of $935 - $955 million. Comparable store sales performance is expected to be positive low single digits after taking into account the potential negative sales impact of an earlier Easter. Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.35.
For the full year, the Company estimates sales will range from $4.22-$4.33 billion. This estimate is predicated on a square footage growth of approximately 10%. Comparable store sales are projected to be in the positive 1% to 3% range.
Fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.10.  These estimates include approximately $200 million of estimated share repurchases in 2007. The Company has $427 million available to repurchase shares under a $500 million authorization approved in November 2006.
On Wednesday, February 28, 2007, the Company will
host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EST. The telephone number for the call is 800-289-0572. A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Wednesday, March 7, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the access code is 3056149. International callers may dial 719-457-0820 and the access code is 3056149. The call will be webcast via Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com/medialist.cfm, as well as at Vcalls website, www.Vcall.com, and will remain on-line until midnight Wednesday, March 7.
 
The Company has decided to discontinue its quarterly pre-recorded business update, which was customarily delivered on the first Thursday of the last month of each quarter. Dollar Tree will continue to report sales on a quarterly basis, before market opening. The Company will report sales for the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 on Thursday, May 10.
As of February 3, 2007, Dollar Tree operated 3,219 stores in 48 states.
