Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va. - May 10, 2007 -
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal first quarter of 2007 were $975.0 million, a 13.8% increase compared to $856.5 million in last years fiscal first quarter. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 5.8%.
Although challenged by an earlier Easter selling season, our comparable-store sales momentum continued to build in the first quarter, President and CEO Bob Sasser said. The 5.8% comparable-store sales increase was on top of a 4.0% increase in comp-store sales for the same period last year. Sales gains were driven by improved in-stock on basic products and strong seasonal sales, particularly for Valentines Day and Easter.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its first quarter 2007 operating results and provide guidance for the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2007 during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, May 30, 2007, 9:00 a.m. EDT.
