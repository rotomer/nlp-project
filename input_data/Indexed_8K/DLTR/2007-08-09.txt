Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 9, 2007  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal second quarter of 2007 were $971.2 million, a 9.9% increase compared to $883.6 million in last years fiscal second quarter.  Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 4.4%.
Our sales results reflect continuing increases in average ticket and customer traffic, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  The Company delivered a comparable-store sales increase over 4% for the sixth quarter in a row.  Our merchandise was right for the season as our Cool Summer Savings program generated excitement by featuring key items for picnic, patriotic holidays, and toys.  Store execution continues to improve and we have made a quick and orderly transition to back to school and fall product.
Based on the continued strength of comparable-store sales and the related leverage, the Company now anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter to be $0.32 to $0.33 versus the previously announced guidance range of $0.29 to $0.32.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its second quarter 2007 operating results and guidance for the third fiscal quarter during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, August 29, 2007, 9:00 a.m. EDT.  The telephone number for the call is 800-289-0726.

A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com/medialist.cfm, and will remain on-line until midnight Wednesday, September 5.
Dollar Tree operated 3,334 stores in 48 states as of August 4, 2007, compared to 3,156 stores in 48 states a year ago.
