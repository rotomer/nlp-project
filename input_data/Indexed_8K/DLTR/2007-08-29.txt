Exhibit 99.1
 
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 29, 2007  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.33, for the fiscal second quarter ended August 4, 2007, an increase of 17.9% over the $0.28 earnings per diluted share for the same period, one year ago.  Sales for the quarter were $971.2 million, a 9.9% increase compared to $883.6 million, for the same period, one year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 4.4% for the quarter.
I am pleased to report another strong quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  Our comparable store sales performance continues to be driven by consistent increases in traffic and ticket.  I am particularly encouraged by the improvement in gross margin during the second quarter, and our inventory turns which accelerated by more than 40 basis points for the first half of 2007.
For the second quarter, the gross margin rate was 33.6%, 40 basis points above the 33.2% reported in last years second quarter.  This improvement in rate reflects improved mark-up on merchandise and leverage on buying, distribution, and occupancy costs attributable to the comparable store sales increase.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.1% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 27.7% in the same quarter last year.  The increase in rate was driven by an approximate $0.02 charge incurred to settle certain employment-related litigation, including related attorney fees, which resulted in 30 basis points of additional selling, general and administrative expense.  Increased advertising and debit fees also provided additional pressure on the expense rate in the quarter.
Operating margin in this years second quarter was 5.5%, which is about 4 basis points higher when compared to the same period, one year ago.  Excluding amounts incurred for the employment-related litigation, operating margins would have increased 34 basis points over last years second quarter.
The Company opened 59 stores, closed 5 stores, and expanded or relocated 26 stores in the second fiscal quarter of 2007.  The Companys retail selling square footage totaled approximately 27.5 million at August 4, 2007, an 8.3% increase compared to a year ago.
consideration of an additional $13 million spent on share repurchase in the third quarter to date, there is approximately $198 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors last November.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company expended $62 million for share repurchase.
 
In
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2007 to be in the range of $1.00 - $1.02 billion, based on a low to low- mid single digit positive comparable store sales increase.  Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.38.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $4.28 to $4.35 billion, based on a low to low- mid single digit positive comparable store sales increase for the full year.  Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share is expected to be $2.04 to $2.14.
On Wednesday, August 29, 2007, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EDT.  The telephone number for the call is 800-289-0726.  A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Wednesday, September 5, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the pass code is 6326214.  International callers may dial 719-457-0820 and the pass code is 6326214.
