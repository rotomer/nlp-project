Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 8, 2007  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal third quarter of 2007 were $997.8 million, a 9.6% increase compared to $910.4 million in last years fiscal third quarter.  Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 1.9%.
Sales gains were driven by increases in store traffic and average ticket, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  Our seasonal sales were strong as both the Halloween and Back-to-School selling seasons were solid.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, our inventory is in excellent shape, our stores have quickly transitioned into Christmas with a great line-up of seasonal product and every-day values, and we now have the added convenience of Visa credit acceptance at all of our stores, just in time for peak holiday sales.
The Company expects diluted earnings per share for the third quarter to be within the previous guidance range of $0.35 to $0.38.
The Company recently announced the roll-out of Visa credit card acceptance to all of its stores effective October 31, 2007.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its third quarter 2007 operating results and guidance for the fourth quarter during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, November 28, 2007, 9:00 a.m. EST.
