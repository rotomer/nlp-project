Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 28, 2007  Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.38, for the fiscal third quarter ended November 3, 2007, an increase of nearly 19% over the prior year.  As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $997.8 million, a 9.6% increase from $910.4 million, for the same period, last year.  Comparable store sales increased 1.9% for the quarter.
I am pleased with Dollar Trees growth in sales and earnings, and especially the improvement in gross margin during the quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  Our seasonal business was strong as our stores continue to create merchandise excitement, and both traffic and average ticket increased.
Consumers today are faced with high energy prices, an uncertain economy and a real need to stretch their dollar.  In light of this potential flight to value, Dollar Tree is more relevant than ever.  Our stores are ready and well-positioned to deliver extreme value during the Holiday selling season.
For the third quarter, gross margin was 34.5%, compared to 33.8% in last years third quarter.  The improvement in rate was principally the result of higher merchandise margins and improved shrink performance relative to the same period one year ago.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.4% in the third quarter of 2007, compared to 27.9% in the same quarter last year.  The increase in rate reflects the anniversary of the benefit to selling, general, and administrative expenses relating to payments received for early lease terminations in the same period, one year ago.
Operating margin in this years third quarter was 6.0%, versus 5.9% for the same period in 2006.  The tax rate for the quarter was 36.5%, compared to 35.8% for the third quarter last year.
During the third quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased over four million shares of its common stock, for approximately $163.1 million, which brings the year-to-date total to $378.4 million of funds used to repurchase 9.4 million shares of common stock.
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 to be in the range of $1.31 billion - $1.35 billion.  Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.06.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $4.25 billion - $4.29 billion.  Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.06 - $2.13.
On Wednesday, November 28, 2007, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EST.  The telephone number for the call is 800-811-8845.  A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Tuesday, December 4, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the access code is 5940726.  International callers may dial 719-457-0820 and the access code is 5940726.  A webcast of the call will be accessible via Dollar Tree's website, www.DollarTree.com/medialist.cfm.
