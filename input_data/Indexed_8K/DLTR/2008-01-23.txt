Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Director Compensation
On January 16, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors established a new policy for director compensation based on recommendations by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The new policy offers a total compensation package that the Board believes is commensurate with other public retailers and better aligns director and shareholder interests.  The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the changes to director compensation, as further described below.
Director compensation is established by the Board of Directors and periodically reviewed.  For 2007, each non-employee director  that is, every director other than Macon Brock and Bob Sasser  received an annual retainer of $80,000.  In addition, the audit committee chair received $8,000 and audit committee members received $4,000; the other committee chairs and committee members received $4,000 and $2,000, respectively.  Under our 2003 Director Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may elect to invest their cash fees in our common stock, options or an interest-bearing cash account.
Beginning at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board has determined that each non-employee director will receive an annual retainer of $100,000, payable quarterly.  In addition, the audit committee chair will receive $15,000 and audit committee members will receive $10,000; the other committee chairs and committee members will receive $7,500 and $5,000, respectively.  The Lead Director will receive an additional $10,000.

The Committee approved the grant of 34,000 restricted stock units to Bob Sasser; 52,500 options to Gary Philbin; and 17,000 restricted stock units to Robert Rudman.  The vesting of the units or options is subject to the Company achieving a target level of earnings per share in fiscal 2008 and the executives remaining with the Company over a specified period of time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the person or person entitled to such notice, either before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation.

QUORUM
Articles of Incorporation, except that in the election of directors, those receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not receiving a majority.
