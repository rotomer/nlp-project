Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On February 20, 2008, the Company entered into a five-year $550.0 million Credit Agreement (the Agreement) with Wachovia Bank, N.A, as administrative agent.  The Agreement provides for a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit, and a $250.0 million term loan.  The interest rate on the facility will be based, at the Companys option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.  The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly.  The term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the Agreement.  The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually.  The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.  The Companys $450.0 million revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the Agreement.  A copy of the Agreement is attached to this filing as Exhibit 10.1.

We are filing this Item 5.02(e) to attach the forms of the agreements applicable to these awards as Exhibit 10.2 and Exhibit 10.3 hereto.
 
Each of the above referenced awards was made under either the Companys 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan or the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, both previously approved by the shareholders.

Computation of Interest and Fees
 
(a)
 
Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed.  All other interest and fees and all other interest amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof.  Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective.  Any change in the interest rate on an Index Rate Loan or Index Rate Swingline Loan resulting from a change in the Index Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Index Rate shall become effective.  The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change.
 
(b)
 
Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate.
 
(c)
 
It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect.  All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral.  In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law.  If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such interest shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document.  If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans.  The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand.  All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.

If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent
 
(a)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made by such Lender (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make the proceeds of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
 
(b)
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due from it hereunder (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that the Borrower does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to each Lender on such payment date an amount equal to the portion of such assumed payment to which such Lender is entitled hereunder, and if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to such Lender.  If such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent on a date after the date such amount was made available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each day from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

Inability to Determine Interest Rate
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (i) the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for an Interest Period, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR Tranche during an Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period.  Unless the Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify its request regarding such LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans.  Until any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as, continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so affected.

Illegality
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain in the interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist, and (c) such Lenders Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law as Alternate Base Rate Loans.  The Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender in making any repayment in accordance with this Section including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; , , that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

Requirements of Law

If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
 
(i)
 
shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Letter of Credit or any application relating thereto, any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);
 
(ii)
 
shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or
 
(iii)
 
shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or the Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or under any Note, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Lender reasonably deems to be material as determined by such Lender with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans or Letters of Credit.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph of this Section; , , that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable under this Section submitted by a Lender (which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the computation), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Lender may use any method of averaging and attribution that it shall reasonably deem applicable.

If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note.  The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower.

Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.6(c) (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN, W-8 ECI or W-8 IMY, as applicable (or successor forms) certifying such Lenders entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note.

In the event that such Lender receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower.  In the event that no refund or credit is obtained with respect to the Borrowers payments to such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(d), then such Lender shall upon request provide a certification that such Lender has not received a refund or credit for such payments.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(d) shall require a Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount of any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 2.17(d) to the Borrower or any other party.

Nothing in this Section 2.18 is intended to limit the reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.3(d) hereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.18, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify the applicable Issuing Lender in respect of any liability incurred by the applicable Issuing Lender arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Issuing Lender (including action not taken by the applicable Issuing Lender), as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 10.1
 
.
The Guaranty
 
In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder, each of the Guarantors hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as follows:  each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of any and all indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  If any or all of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders becomes due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on order, on demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting any of the indebtedness.  The word indebtedness is used in this Article X in its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances, debts, obligations and liabilities of the Borrower arising in connection with this Agreement, in each case, heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such indebtedness is from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred, whether the Borrower may be liable individually or jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such indebtedness may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether or not such indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).
 
Section 10.2
 
.
Bankruptcy
 
Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lenders whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 7.1(e), and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that the Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to the Borrower or a Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
 
Section 10.3
 
.
Nature of Liability
 
The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the indebtedness of the Borrower whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and no Guarantors liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the indebtedness of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the indebtedness which the Administrative Agent or such Lenders repay the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.  The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or a guarantor.
 
Section 10.4
 
.
Independent Obligation
 
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
 
Section 10.5
 
.
Authorization
 
Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each Lender without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the terms of the indebtedness or any part thereof in accordance with this Agreement, including any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon, (b) take and hold security from any Guarantor or any other party for the payment of this Guaranty or the indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors.
 
Section 10.6
 
.
Reliance
 
It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
 
Section 10.7
 
.
Waiver
 
(a)
 
Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agents or any Lenders power whatsoever.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party other than payment in full of the indebtedness, including without limitation any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the indebtedness or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the indebtedness.  Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this Article X, each of the Guarantors hereby specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat.  26-7 through 26-9, inclusive.  The Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent and any Lender may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness has been paid.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against the Borrower or any other party or any security.
 
(b)
 
Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices of nonperformance, notices of amendments or modifications to this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.  Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the indebtedness and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(c)
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the indebtedness of the Borrower owing to the Lenders (collectively, the ) and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until such time as the Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the Commitments have been terminated.  Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the indebtedness of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to or for the benefit of the Lenders to secure payment of the indebtedness of the Borrower until such time as the Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the Commitments have been terminated.
Other Parties

.
Limitation on Enforcement
 
The Lenders agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no Lender shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders upon the terms of this Agreement.  The Lenders further agree that this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Guarantors.
 
Section 10.9

Confirmation of Payment
 
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after payment of the indebtedness and obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty and termination of the commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower, the Guarantors or any other Person that such indebtedness and obligations have been paid and the commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

Exhibit 10.2
(As revised effective February 15, 2008)
NOTE: This document incorporates the accompanying Grant Letter, and together they constitute a single Agreement which governs the terms and conditions of your Award in accordance with the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan or 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan, as applicable.
 
THIS AGREEMENT (Agreement), is effective as of the Grant Date specified in the accompanying Grant Letter, by and between the Participant and Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Company).
 
A. The Company maintains both the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) and the 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP).
 
B. The Participant has been selected by the committee administering the EIP and EOEP (Committee) to receive a Restricted Stock Unit Award under one of these plans.
 
C. Key terms and important conditions of the Award are set forth in the cover letter (Grant Letter) which was delivered to the Participant at the same time as this document. This Agreement contains general provisions relating to the Award. The Grant Letter specifies whether the Award is issued under the EIP or the EOEP (whichever is applicable, the Plan).
 
IT IS AGREED, by and between the Company and the Participant, as follows:
 
1. . The following terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in this paragraph 1:
Terms of Award
 
(a) The Participant is the individual named in the Grant Letter.
 
(b) The Grant Date is the date of the Grant Letter.
 
(c) The Units means an award denominated in shares of the Companys Stock as specified in the Grant Letter.
 
(d) The Restricted Period shall begin on the Grant Date and extend, with respect to successive installments of Units (if any), until the dates and/or events specified in the Grant Letter. With respect to an Award conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives set forth in the Grant Letter, the Restricted Period shall continue until the Committee issues its written determination that such performance objectives have been met.
 
Other terms used in this Agreement are defined pursuant to paragraph 8 or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
2. . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Participant is hereby granted the number of Units set forth in paragraph 1.
Award
 
3. . The Company shall deliver to the Participant one share of Stock (or cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock) for each vested Unit, as determined in accordance with the provisions of Grant Letter, which forms a part of this Agreement. The Units payable to the Participant in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 3 shall be paid solely in shares of Stock, solely in cash based on the Fair Market Value of the Stock (determined as of the first business day next following the last day of the Restricted Period), or in a combination of the two, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, except that cash shall be distributed in lieu of any fractional share of Stock.
Settlement of Awards
 
4. . Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, payment of Units vested in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 will be delivered as soon as practicable after the end of the Restricted Period; provided that any cash payment or delivery of shares shall occur no later than the 15 day of the third month following the end of the calendar year during which the Restricted Period ends.  To the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, in the event the Participant is a specified employee as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(i) on the Date of Termination (as defined below), any amounts payable hereunder shall be paid no earlier than the first business day after the six month anniversary of the Date of Termination.  Whether the Participant is a specified employee and whether an amount payable to the Participant hereunder is subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be determined by the Company.
Time of Payment
th
 
5. .
Vesting and Forfeiture of Units
 
(a) If the Participants Date of Termination does not occur during the Restricted Period with respect to any Units, then, at the end of the Restricted Period for such Units, the Participant shall become vested only in those Units, and shall be entitled to settlement with respect to such Units free of all restrictions otherwise imposed by this Agreement.
 
(b) The Participant shall become vested in the Units, and become entitled to settlement with respect to such Units free of all restrictions otherwise imposed by this Agreement, prior to the end of the Restricted Period, as follows:
 
(i) The Participant shall become vested in Units as of the Participants Date of Termination prior to the date the Units would otherwise become vested, if the Participants Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participants death, Disability or Retirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Award is conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives set forth in the Grant Letter, then the Participant shall become vested under this paragraph 5(b)(i) only at the end of the then-current Restricted Period (assuming achievement of the performance objectives), pro-rated based on the ratio of actual months of employment by the Participant to the total number of months in the Restricted Period.
 
(ii) The Participant shall become vested in Units as of the date of a Change in Control, if (i) the Change in Control occurs prior to the end of the Restricted Period, (ii) the Participants Date of Termination does not occur before the Change in Control date, and (iii) the Committee determines to accelerate such vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Award is conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives set forth in the Grant Letter, then the amount of Units subject to accelerated vesting under paragraph 5(b)(ii) shall not exceed the pro rata amount based on the ratio of actual months of employment by the Participant to the date of the Change of Control to the total number of months in the Restricted Period. The accelerated vesting of such pro rata portion may assume that the performance objectives will be met, with partial settlement of the Units to occur as soon as practical after the Change of Control. If in fact the performance objectives are not met at the end of the Restricted Period, then the Participant shall not be required to repay any amounts or forfeit any Stock on account of any distribution made under this paragraph 5(b)(ii). If the Committee determines to accelerate vesting of such an Award in this manner, then the remainder of the Award shall be unaffected, with settlement of such Award at the end of the original Restricted Period (assuming the performance objectives have been met), less any distribution made on account of accelerated vesting pursuant to this paragraph 5(b)(ii).
 
(c) The Participant shall forfeit all unvested Units, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 5:
 
(i) as of the Participants Date of Termination
 
(ii) as of the date on which the Committee determines the Participant materially violated (A) the provisions of paragraph 10 below or (B) any non-competition agreement which the Participant may have entered into with the Company, and
 
(iii) as of the date on which the Committee determines that one or more of the performance objectives identified in the Grant Letter, if any, were not achieved.
 
6. . All deliveries and distributions under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. The Company is entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts due to Participant) or make other arrangements for the collection of all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy such withholding or (b) require the Participant promptly to remit such amounts to the Company. Subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee from time to time, the withholding obligations described in this Section 6 may be satisfied through the surrender of shares of Stock which the Participant already owns, or to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan, including shares of Stock to be settled under this Agreement.
Withholding
 
7. .
Transferability
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7(b), Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until the expiration of the Restricted Period or, if earlier, until the Participant is vested in the Units. Transfers at death are governed by paragraph 9(c) below.
 
(b) The Participant, with the approval of the Committee, may transfer unvested Units during his or her lifetime for no consideration to or for the benefit of the Participants Immediate Family, subject to such limits as the Committee may establish, and the Participant and the transferee shall remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted Units prior to such transfer (including without limitation all determinations as to vesting and forfeiture). The foregoing right to transfer the Units shall apply to the right to consent to amendments to this Agreement and, in the discretion of the Committee, shall also apply to the right to transfer ancillary rights associated with the Units, if any.
 
(c) The term Immediate Family shall mean Participants child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the Participants household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the Participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests. The following transactions are not prohibited transfers for consideration: (i) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights; and (ii) a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by the Immediate Family (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity.
 
8. . For purposes of this Agreement, the terms used in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:
Definitions
 
(a) Change in Control. The term Change in Control has the meaning set forth in the Plan.
 
(b) Date of Termination. The Participants Date of Termination shall be the first day occurring on or after the Grant Date on which the Participant is not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, regardless of the reason for the termination of employment; provided that a termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur by reason of a transfer of the Participant between the Company and a Subsidiary or between two Subsidiaries; and further provided that the Participants employment shall not be considered terminated while the Participant is on a leave of absence from the Company or a Subsidiary approved by the Participants employer.
 
(c) Disability. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, the Participant shall be considered to have a Disability during the period in which the Participant is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to engage in any substantial gainful activity, which condition, in the opinion of a physician selected by the Committee, is expected to have a duration of not less than 120 days.
 
(d) Retirement. Retirement of the Participant shall mean, with the approval of the Committee, the occurrence of the Participants Date of Termination on or after the date the Participant attains age fifty-nine (59) years, six (6) months, following at least seven (7) years of service.
 
(e) Plan Definitions. Except where the context clearly implies or indicates the contrary, a word, term, or phrase used in the Plan is similarly used in this Agreement.
 
9. .
Binding Effect; Heirs and Successors
 
(a) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be effective upon delivery to the Participant, with or without execution by the Participant.
 
(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Company and its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Companys assets and business.
 
(c) If any rights exercisable by the Participant or benefits deliverable to the Participant under this Agreement have not been exercised or delivered, respectively, at the time of the Participants death, such rights shall be exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary, and such benefits shall be delivered to the Designated Beneficiary, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. The Designated Beneficiary shall be the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Participant in a writing filed with the Committee in such form and at such time as the Committee shall require. If a deceased Participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the Designated Beneficiary does not survive the Participant, any rights that would have been exercisable by the Participant and any benefits distributable to the Participant shall be exercised by or distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Participant. If a deceased Participant designates a beneficiary and the Designated Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before the Designated Beneficiarys exercise of all rights under this Agreement or before the complete distribution of benefits to the Designated Beneficiary under this Agreement, then any rights that would have been exercisable by the Designated Beneficiary shall be exercised by the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary, and any benefits distributable to the Designated Beneficiary shall be distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Designated Beneficiary.
 
10. . The Participant recognizes and acknowledges that the Companys trade secrets, confidential information, and proprietary information, including customer and vendor lists and computer data and programs (collectively Confidential Information), are valuable, special and unique assets of the Companys business, access to and knowledge of which are essential to the performance of the Participants duties. The Participant will not, before or after his Date of Termination, in whole or in part, disclose such Confidential Information to any person or entity or make such Confidential Information public for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall the Participant make use of such Confidential Information for the Participants own purposes or for the benefit of any person or entity other than the Company under any circumstances before or after the Participants Date of Termination; provided that this prohibition shall not apply after the Participants Date of Termination to Confidential Information that has become publicly known through no action of the Participant. The Participant shall consider and treat as the Companys property all memoranda, books, records, papers, letters, computer data or programs, or customer lists, including any copies thereof in human- or machine-readable form, in any way relating to the Companys business or affairs, financial or otherwise, whether created by the Participant or coming into his or her possession, and shall deliver the same to the Company on the Date of Termination or, on demand of the Company, at any earlier time.
Disclosure of Information
 
11. . The authority to manage and control the operation and administration of this Agreement shall be vested in the Committee, and the Committee shall have all powers with respect to this Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of the Agreement by the Committee and any decision made by it with respect to the Agreement is final and binding on all persons. Such powers or decision-making may be delegated, to the extent permitted by the Plan, to one or more of Committee members or any other person or persons selected by the Committee.
Administration
 
12. . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of this Agreement shall wholly incorporate and be subject to the terms of the Plan, a copy of which may be obtained from the Chief People Officer of the Company (or such other party as the Company may designate); and this Agreement is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time pursuant to the Plan.
Plan Governs
 
13. .
No Implied Rights
 
(a) The award of Units will not confer on the Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Participants employment or other service at any time.
 
(b) The Participant shall not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the Units until shares of Stock have been duly issued following settlement of the Award as provided herein.
 
14. . Any written notices provided for in this Agreement or the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given if either hand delivered or if sent by fax or overnight courier, or by postage paid first class mail. Notices sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing but in no event later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to the Participant, at the Participants address indicated by the Companys records, or if to the Company, at the Companys principal executive office.
Notices
 
15. . This Agreement may be amended by written agreement of the Participant and the Company, without the consent of any other person.
Amendment
 
16. . This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia without giving effect to the choice-of-law provisions thereof. The Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk and the United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division shall be the exclusive courts of jurisdiction and venue for any litigation, special proceeding or other proceeding as between the parties that may be brought, or arise out of, in connection with, or by reason of this Agreement. The parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.

Forward to Exhibit 10.3

Exhibit 10.3
(As revised effective February 15, 2008)
NOTE: This document incorporates the accompanying Grant Letter, and together they constitute a single Agreement which governs the terms and conditions of your Option in accordance with the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan or 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan, as applicable.
 
THIS AGREEMENT (Agreement), is effective as of the Grant Date specified in the accompanying Grant Letter, by and between the Participant and Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (Company).
 
A. The Company maintains both the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) and the 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan (EOEP).
 
B. The Participant has been selected by the committee administering the EIP and EOEP (Committee) to receive a Non-Qualified Stock Option Award under one of these plans.
 
C. Key terms and important conditions of the Award are set forth in the cover letter (Grant Letter) which was delivered to the Participant at the same time as this document. This Agreement contains general provisions relating to the Award. The Grant Letter specifies whether the Award is issued under the EIP or the EOEP (whichever is applicable, the Plan).
 
IT IS AGREED, by and between the Company and the Participant, as follows:
 
1. . The following terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in this paragraph 1:
Terms of Award
 
(a) The Participant is the individual named in the Grant Letter.
 
(b) The Grant Date is the date of the Grant Letter.
 
(c) The Covered Shares is that number of shares of the Companys Stock specified in the Grant Letter.
 
(d) The Exercise Price is the price per common share set forth in the Grant Letter.
 
Other terms used in this Agreement are defined pursuant to paragraph 8 or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 
2. . This Agreement specifies the terms of the option (the Option) granted to the Participant to purchase the number of Covered Shares at the Exercise Price per share. The Option is not an incentive stock option as that term is used in Code section 422.
Award and Exercise Price
 
3. . Subject to the limitations of this Agreement, the Option shall be exercisable in accordance with the terms set forth in the Grant Letter. An Option shall not become exercisable on the otherwise applicable vesting date if the Participants Date of Termination (as defined in paragraph 8) occurs on or before such vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, however, the Option shall become exercisable with respect to the Covered Shares (to the extent it is not then otherwise exercisable) as follows:
Date of Exercise
 
(a) The Option shall become fully exercisable upon the Participants Date of Termination, if the Participants Date of Termination occurs by reason of the Participants death, Retirement or Disability.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Option is conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives set forth in the Grant Letter, then the Option shall become exercisable under this paragraph 3(a) only as of the applicable vesting date (assuming achievement of the performance objectives), with the number of Covered Shares exercisable pro-rated based on the ratio of actual months of employment by the Participant to the total number of months in the applicable vesting schedule, if any.
(b) The Option shall become fully exercisable upon a Change in Control, if (i) the Participants Date of Termination does not occur before the Change in Control and (ii) the Committee determines to accelerate such exercisability.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Option is conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives set forth in the Grant Letter, then the amount of Covered Shares subject to accelerated vesting under this paragraph 3(b) shall not exceed the pro rata amount based on the ratio of actual months of employment by the Participant to the date of the Change of Control to the total number of months in the applicable vesting schedule, if any.  The accelerated vesting of such pro rata portion may assume that the performance objectives will be met, with partial settlement of the Option to occur as soon as practical after the Change of Control. If in fact the performance objectives are not met at the end of the applicable vesting schedule, then the Participant shall not be required to repay any amounts or forfeit any of the Option or any stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option.  If the Committee determines to accelerate vesting of such Option in this manner, then the remainder of the Covered Shares shall be unaffected, with full vesting of such remaining Covered Shares on the applicable vesting date (assuming the performance objectives have been met).
 
The Option may be exercised on or after the Date of Termination only as to that portion of the Covered Shares as to which it was exercisable immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or as to which it became exercisable on the Date of Termination in accordance with this paragraph 3.
 
 
 
 
4. . The Option shall not be exercisable after the Companys close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date. The Expiration Date shall be earliest to occur of:
Expiration
 
(a) the ten year anniversary of the Grant Date;
 
(b) if the Participants Date of Termination occurs by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, the three-year anniversary of such Date of Termination;
 
(c) if the Participants Date of Termination occurs for reasons other than cause, death, Disability, or Retirement, the 90-day anniversary of such Date of Termination; or
 
(d) if the Participants Date of Termination occurs for cause, the Date of Termination; or
 
(e) the date on which the Committee determines the Participant materially violated (i) the provisions of paragraph 10 below or (ii) any non-competition agreement which the Participant may have entered into with the Company.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Chief People Officer (or such other party as the Company may designate) of the Company at its corporate headquarters prior to the Companys close of business on the last business day that occurs prior to the Expiration Date. Such notice shall specify the number of Covered Shares which the Participant elects to purchase, and shall be accompanied by payment of the Exercise Price for such shares of Stock indicated by the Participants election.
 
(b) Payment shall be by cash or by check payable to the Company. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee before the Option is exercised: (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by the Participant by delivery of shares of Stock that have been owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months and are otherwise acceptable to the Committee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; and
 
 
(ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.
 
(c) The Option shall not be exercisable if and to the extent the Company determines that such exercise would violate applicable state or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which the Stock is traded. If the Company makes such a determination, it shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain compliance with such laws, rules and regulations. In making any determination hereunder, the Company may rely on the opinion of counsel for the Company.
(d) The Option does not include and may not be amended to include any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the income that may be deferred until the exercise of the Option, or the time the stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Option first becomes substantially vested.
 
6. . All deliveries and distributions under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. The Company is entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts due to Participant) or make other arrangements for the collection of all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy such withholding or (b) require the Participant promptly to remit such amounts to the Company. At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied through the surrender of shares of Stock which the Participant already owns, or to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan.

Transferability
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7(b), the Option is not transferable and during the Participants life, may be exercised only by the Participant. Transfers at death are governed by paragraph 9(c) below.
 
(b) The Participant, with the approval of the Committee, may transfer the Option during his or her lifetime for no consideration to or for the benefit of the Participants Immediate Family, subject to such limits as the Committee may establish, and the transferee shall remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Option prior to such transfer. The foregoing right to transfer the Option shall apply to the right to consent to amendments to this Agreement and, in the discretion of the Committee, shall also apply to the right to transfer ancillary rights associated with the Option.
 
 
 
 
(c) The term Immediate Family shall mean Participants child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the Participants household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which these persons have more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the Participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own more than fifty percent of the voting interests. The following transactions are not prohibited transfers for consideration: (i) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights; and (ii) a transfer to an entity in which more than fifty percent of the voting interests are owned by the Immediate Family (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity.
