Compensatory Arrangements.
On March 12, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. conducted its annual review of the base salaries and incentive compensation of the Companys executive officers.
: For fiscal 2008, the Committee established annual base salaries for certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers as shown in the following table.
Base Salaries
:  The Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2007 which ended on February 2, 2008.  The Committee also established the target bonus levels of 100% of salary for the CEO, 50% of salary for the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer and 35% of salary for the Vice President, Controller, and established the potential bonus and performance goals for fiscal year 2008.  Consistent with past practice, 85% of the potential award is based on the Companys earnings per share and 15% is based on the officer achieving personal performance goals.  The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2007 and bonus potential for fiscal 2008:
Annual Incentive Bonus
The Compensation Committee also approved a bonus payment for fiscal 2007 of $270,840 for the Chairman of the Board, Macon F. Brock, Jr.
The bonus potential for fiscal 2008 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its earnings per share goal and the executive achieves 100% of the personal performance goals.  Within certain limits, if the Company exceeds (or does not meet) its earnings per share goal, the executives bonus can exceed (or fall below) the bonus potential set forth above.
: The Committee approved the grant, effective March 14, 2007, of 64,000 options and 28,500 restricted stock units to Bob Sasser; 19,000 options and 8,500 restricted stock units to Gary Philbin; 18,000 options and 8,000 restricted stock units to Bob Rudman; and 6,250 options and 2,575 restricted stock units to Kathleen Mallas.
Current Year Equity Awards
Each of the above-referenced shares, was awarded under either the Companys 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan or the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, both approved by the shareholders.
The Company has amended its officers outstanding stock option awards to allow these options to be exercised for the original 10-year term following the officers (i) retirement after age 59  with seven years of service, (ii) death or (iii) disability.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
