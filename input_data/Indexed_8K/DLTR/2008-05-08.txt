Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 8, 2008  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest $1.00 discount variety store chain, reported total sales for its fiscal first quarter of 2008 were $1.051 billion, a 7.8% increase compared to $975.0 million in last years fiscal first quarter. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 2.1%.
Sales were strong throughout the quarter and exceeded guidance, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  Dollar Tree is relevant for these challenging times. When customers are pressured by rising prices, they know that we have the things they need and want for just $1, everyday.
 Sales for the quarter were driven by Food, Health and Beauty Care, and Party Supplies.  Both traffic and average ticket increased for the quarter.
The Company will provide more detailed information about its first quarter 2008 operating results and provide guidance for the second quarter and the balance of fiscal 2008 during its upcoming earnings conference call scheduled for Wednesday, May 28, 2008, 9:00 a.m. EDT.
