Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 28, 2008  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.48, for the fiscal first quarter ended May 3, 2008, an increase of 26.3% over the $0.38 earnings per diluted share for the same period, one year ago. Sales for the quarter were $1.051 billion, a 7.8% increase compared to $975.0 million, for the same period, one year ago. Comparable store sales increased 2.1% for the quarter.
I am pleased with the Companys first quarter performance, said President and CEO Bob Sasser. Both sales and earnings per share exceeded guidance and were first quarter records for Dollar Tree.
We are relevant for the times. Customers are responding positively to our consistent value on basic everyday needs, all for just $1.
For the first quarter, the gross margin rate was 33.9%, a 50 basis point improvement over the 33.4% reported in last years first quarter.  This rate reflects improvements in merchandise margin and shrink.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.3 % in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 27.0% in the same quarter last year.  The increase in rate reflects greater advertising expense as well as higher fees associated with increased penetration of debit cards and Visa credit.
Operating margin in this years first quarter was 6.6%, a 20 basis point improvement compared to the 6.4% reported for the same period, one year ago.
The tax rate was 36.0%, compared with 37.2% in the first quarter 2007. The decrease is due to the recognition of certain tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48 which offset a reduction in tax exempt interest income.
The Company estimates sales for the second quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $1.045 - $1.075 billion, based on low single digit positive comparable store sales. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.36.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.63 billion while diluted earnings per share are expected to be $2.23 to $2.39.
On Wednesday, May 28, 2008, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EDT.  The telephone number for the call is 888-278-8459.  A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Wednesday, June 4, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the access code is 9874962.  A webcast of the call is accessible through Dollar Tree's website, , and will remain on-line until midnight Wednesday, June 4.
