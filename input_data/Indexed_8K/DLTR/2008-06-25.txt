The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time, in one or more series, each of which series shall be designated by such appropriate designations as may be stated in such amendment or amendments to these Articles of Incorporation providing for the issuance of the stock of such series as may be adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time, a copy of which amendment or amendments shall have been filed with and made effective (without shareholder approval) by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia as required by law.  Subject to the provisions hereof, all shares of any one series shall be alike in every particular and except for the relative rights and preferences as to which there may be variations between different series as set forth in this Article III, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be alike in every particular.  The Board of Directors shall have power and authority, subject to all the provisions of these Articles and of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, to state and determine, in the amendment or amendments providing for the issue of each series of Preferred Stock, the number of shares of each such series authorized to be issued and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights pertaining to each such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including, full power and authority to determine, as to the Preferred Stock of each such series (a) the rate of dividend, the time of payment, whether dividends shall be cumulative and if so, the dates from which dividends shall be cumulative, and the extent of participation rights, if any, (b) any right to vote with holders of shares of any other series or class and any right to vote as a class, either generally or as a condition to specified corporate action, and the number of votes, if any, to be exercised for each share, (c) the price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be redeemed, (d) the amount payable upon shares in event of involuntary liquidation, (e) the amount payable upon shares in event of voluntary liquidation, (f) sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of shares, (g) the terms and conditions on which shares may be converted if the shares of any series are issued with the privilege of conversion, and (h) any other designations, rights, preferences or limitations that are now or hereafter permitted by law and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section B(1).

Dividends on the Preferred Stock of each series shall be at such rates or to such extent, payable in such manner, under such conditions and on such dates as shall be stated in the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation providing for the issuance of each such series of Preferred Stock.  The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends as may from time to time be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, subject to the rights of the series of Preferred Stock outstanding from time to time.  Dividends on Preferred Stock shall be in preference to dividends on Common Stock, unless otherwise determined by the Board in the amendment or amendments providing for an issue of Preferred Stock.

At each annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the class of directors whose terms shall then expire and any other nominees for election as a director of such class shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting.  If the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or decrease in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes by the Board of  Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible.  Vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be created and filled by action of the Board of Directors between annual meetings of stockholders.  A director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director constitutes a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at an election of directors.

Indemnification of Officers and Directors
1.           To the full extent that the Act permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors and officers, no director or officer of the Corporation made a party to any proceeding shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of any transaction, occurrence or course of conduct, whether occurring prior or subsequent to the effective date of this Article V.
2.           To the full extent permitted by the Act, the Corporation shall indemnify any eligible person who was or is a party to any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of the stockholders of the Corporation, against any liability incurred by him in connection with such proceeding unless he engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law.  To the same extent, the Board of Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any director or officer against liability and/or to advance or reimburse his expenses in respect to any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or after the execution of such contract.
 
 
 
3.           The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all proceedings commenced after it becomes effective, arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or after such effective date.  No amendment or repeal of this Article V shall impair or otherwise diminish the rights provided under this Article V (including those created by contract) with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

nolo
contendere
5.           No indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V (unless ordered by a court of law) shall be made by the Corporation without a determination in the specific case that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the proposed indemnitee has met the standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to his entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V.
The determination shall be made:
(a)           By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(b)           If a quorum cannot be obtained under subsection (a) of this Section B(5), by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board of Directors (in which designation directors who are parties may participate), consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(c)           By special legal counsel:
(d)           By the stockholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the determination.
Authorization of indemnification and evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such authorizations and evaluations shall be made by those entitled under subsection (c) of this Section B(5) to select counsel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification, an advance or reimbursement is claimed, any determination as to such indemnification, advance or reimbursement shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee.  If the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel, the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee each shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal counsel.
6.           (a) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer (and may do so for a person referred to in Section B(7) of this Article V) who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under Section B(2) of this Article V if the director, officer or person furnishes to the Corporation:
i)           a written statement, executed personally, of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to his entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V; and
ii)           a written undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he did not meet such standard of conduct.
(b) The undertaking required by paragraph (ii) of subsection (a) of this Section B(6) shall be an unlimited general obligation but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.
(c)           Authorizations of payments under this Section B(6) shall be made by the persons specified in Section B(5) of this Article V.
7.           The Board of Directors is hereby empowered, by majority vote of a quorum consisting of disinterested directors, to cause the Corporation to indemnify or contract to indemnify any person not specified in Section B(2) of this Article V who was, is or may become a party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, to the same or a lesser extent as if such person were specified as one to whom indemnification is granted in Section B(2) of this Article V.  The provisions of Sections B(3) through B(6) of this Article V shall be applicable to any indemnification provided pursuant to this Section B(7).
 
 
 
8.           The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him in any such capacity or arising from his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
9.           Every reference herein to directors, officers, employees or agents shall include former directors, officers, employees and agents and their respective heirs, executors and administrators.  The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter pursuant to the power hereby conferred by this Article V on the Board of Directors shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that may be purchased and maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims, issues or matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article V.  Nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or provide for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement to indemnity, or provisions for indemnification agreements, By-Laws, or other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the Board of Directors (whether or not any of the directors of the Corporation shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, By-Laws or arrangements); , , that any provision of such agreements, By-Laws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that it is determined to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but other provisions of any such agreements, By-Laws or other arrangements shall not be affected by any such determination.
provided
however
10.           Each provision of this Article V shall be severable, and an adverse determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision.

Nothing in this Article VI shall be construed to require shareholder approval of an amendment or amendments to these Articles of Incorporation providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock in accordance with Article III(B) of these Articles of Incorporation.

B.           The Corporation elects not to be governed by Article 14.1 of the Act, entitled "Control Share Acquisitions," and such Article shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of the Corporation.
C.           Where approval of any voting group of the corporations shareholders is required under the Act for the following actions, approval shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be cast thereon by that voting group: (1) the approval by the shareholders of a plan of merger or share exchange; (2) the approval by the shareholders of a sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of the corporations assets, other than a disposition described in  13.1-723 of the Act or any successor statute, if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity, as described by the Act; (3)  the approval by the shareholders of a plan of domestication; (4)  the approval by the shareholders of a plan of entity conversion; or (5)  the approval by the shareholders of a proposal for dissolution of the corporation.

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States certified mail, postage prepaid, and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date of the Corporation's proxy statement in connection with the last annual meeting of stockholders or if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the applicable annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, not less than 90 days before the date of the applicable annual meeting.  A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, including the complete text of any resolutions to be presented at the annual meeting, and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's stock transfer books, of such stockholder proposing such business, (c) a representation that such stockholder is a stockholder of record and intends to appear in person or by proxy at such meeting to bring the business before the meeting specified in the notice, (d) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by the stockholder and (e) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.

No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Each holder of record of stock of any class shall, as to all matters in respect of which stock of such class has voting power, be entitled to such vote as is provided in the Articles of Incorporation for each share of stock of such class standing in his name on the books of the Corporation.  Unless required by statute or determined by the chairman to be advisable, the vote on any questions need not be by ballot.

Exhibit 99.3
Change in control benefits for NEOs shall only be paid because of a change in control if the executive is either terminated without cause or resigns for good reason.  The present value of all change in control payments (as determined under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code) shall be limited to 2.99 times the NEOs base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code).  Any acceleration of vesting upon a change in control for equity awards that are contingent on the Company achieving a performance goal shall not accelerate until and unless the relevant performance measure is satisfied, even if that does not occur until after the change in control.
The definition of change in control shall be the definition contained in the Companys current agreements, except that an actual change of control shall be required (and not merely shareholder approval) and the portion of the definition relating to a change in voting power shall use a greater than 50% threshold instead of a greater than 30% threshold.  The definition of good reason shall be the same as that contained in the Companys current agreements, except that the portion of the definition relating to a reduction in salary or bonus shall require the reduction to be more than immaterial.
This Section 18 shall apply to new agreements with NEOs made after June 19, 2008 or the modification of existing agreements with NEOs after such date that relate to the subject matter of this guideline.
