Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 27, 2008  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of single-price point dollar stores, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.42, for the fiscal second quarter ended August 2, 2008, an increase of 27.3% over the $0.33 earnings per diluted share for the same period, one year ago.  Sales for the quarter were $1.093 billion, a 12.5% increase compared to $971.2 million, for the same period, one year ago.  Comparable store sales increased 6.5% for the quarter.
Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates the growing relevance of Dollar Tree to the consumer during tough economic times, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  Increased demand for basic, consumable product is driving more customers into our stores, resulting in higher operating margin and earnings in the second quarter.
For the second quarter, the gross margin rate was 33.2%, 40 basis points below the 33.6% reported in last years second quarter.  The decrease in rate was primarily driven by the planned shift in the merchandise mix towards consumables and increased diesel fuel costs, relative to last year.  In addition, the Company continued to improve its shrink rate in the second quarter.  These factors were incorporated in the Companys guidance announced at the end of the first quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.6% in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 28.1% in the same quarter last year, as the Company leveraged depreciation, payroll and other expenses.
Operating margin in this years second quarter was 5.6%, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period, one year ago.
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $1.075 - $1.105 billion, based on low-to-low-mid single digit positive comparable store sales.  Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.43.
Full year sales are now forecasted to be in the range of $4.61 to $4.68 billion, based on low-to-low-mid single digit positive comparable store sales for the full year.  Based upon this sales forecast, diluted earnings per share are expected to be $2.33 to $2.43.
On Wednesday, August 27, 2008, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EDT.  The telephone number for the call is 888-726-2459.  A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Wednesday, September 3, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the pass code is 9124046.
