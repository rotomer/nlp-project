Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  November 25, 2008  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest discount variety store chain selling everything for $1 or less, reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.47, for the fiscal third quarter ended November 1, 2008, an increase of 23.7% over the prior year.  As previously reported, sales for the quarter were $1.11 billion, an 11.6% increase from $997.8 million, for the same period, last year.  Comparable store sales increased 6.2% for the quarter.
Customers continue to respond positively to our increased selection of basic consumable products, great seasonal merchandise and surprising values throughout the store, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  We will continue to focus on the customer, and serving their needs in a very difficult economic environment.
For the third quarter, gross margin was 34.1%, compared to 34.5% in last years third quarter.  The decrease in rate primarily reflects the impact of a planned shift in product mix and higher diesel fuel costs, slightly offset by improvements in inventory shrink.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.8% in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 28.4% in the same quarter last year.  The rate improvement primarily reflects the companys focus on expense control, reduced advertising expense and favorable leverage from the comparable store sales increase.
Operating margin in this years third quarter was 6.2%, versus 6.0% for the same period in 2007.
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $1.38 billion - $1.42 billion, based on low -to-low-mid single digit positive comparable store sales.  Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.15.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $4.64 billion - $4.68 billion.  Full year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 - $2.53.
On Tuesday, November 25, 2008, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EST.  The telephone number for the call is 888-277-7046.
