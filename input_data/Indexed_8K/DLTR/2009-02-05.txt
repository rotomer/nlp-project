Exhibit 99.1  Press Release dated February 5, 2009, issued by Dollar Tree, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  February 5, 2009  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nations largest discount variety store chain selling everything for $1 or less,  reported total sales of $1.39 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2008, a 6.8% increase compared to $1.30 billion in last years fiscal fourth quarter. Comparable-store sales for the quarter increased 2.2%.
 
Dollar Tree continues to be right for the times, said Bob Sasser, President and CEO. The expanded assortment of high-value basic consumable merchandise makes our stores more relevant and continues to drive sales. Comparable-store sales grew despite challenges throughout the quarter, including the calendar shift in November, and a succession of winter storms across the country from mid-December through January.  Holiday sales were very strong despite the weather impact, as customers took advantage of our great values on Christmas seasonal merchandise and basic consumable products.
 
For the full year 2008, sales were a record $4.64 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the $4.24 billion reported last year. Comparable-store sales increased 4.1% for the full year 2008.
The Company expects that earnings per share for the quarter and year will be above the middle of its previous guidance range of $1.07 to $1.15 and $2.45 to $2.53, respectively.
The Company will release its fourth quarter earnings results on Wednesday, February 25, 2009. The Company will also host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EST that day, to discuss the results in detail, and provide insights into its plans for 2009.
