(e) Compensatory Arrangements.
On March 18, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree, Inc. conducted its annual review of the base salaries and incentive compensation of the Companys executive officers.
: The Committee approved the annual base salaries for the Companys Named Executive Officers as shown in the following table.  These base salaries were not increased in fiscal 2009.
Base Salaries for fiscal 2009
:  The Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2008 which ended on January 31, 2009.  The Committee reaffirmed without change the target bonus levels of 100% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 50% of salary for the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer, and established the target bonus and performance goals for fiscal year 2009.  Consistent with past practice, 85% of the award is based on the Companys earnings per share and 15% is based on the officer achieving personal performance goals.  The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2008 and bonus target for fiscal 2009:
Annual Incentive Bonus for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009
Kevin Wampler joined the Company in December 2008 and was not eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus for fiscal 2008.  Macon Brock does not receive annual incentive bonuses.
*
The bonus target for fiscal 2009 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its earnings per share goal and the executive achieves 100% of the personal performance goals.  Within certain limits, if the Company exceeds (or does not meet) its earnings per share goal, the executives bonus can exceed (or fall below) the bonus target set forth above.
The Committee reviewed the performance requirements relating to performance-based restricted stock units and options previously awarded in fiscal 2008.  The Committee determined that the target level of earnings per share for fiscal 2008 had been met.  However, these awards do not vest until the end of the service period on February 14, 2010.  Should they meet the service requirements, Bob Sasser will receive 34,000 restricted stock units, Gary Philbin will receive 52,500 options and Robert Rudman will receive 17,000 restricted stock units.
Prior Year Equity Awards:
The Committee approved the grant, effective April 1, 2009, of performance based awards to certain named executive officers of the Company.  The Committee approved the grant of 50,000 restricted stock units to Bob Sasser; 18,000 restricted stock units to Gary Philbin; 15,000 restricted stock units to Kevin Wampler; and 15,000 restricted stock units to Robert Rudman.  The units vest ratably over three years in one year increments and are subject to the Company achieving a target level of earnings per share in fiscal 2009. The Committee also approved a performance based award of 8,000 restricted stock units to Macon F. Brock, Jr.   The performance measure is the same as for the other named executive officer awards referenced above and these units will vest at the time the Committee certifies that the target earnings per share for fiscal 2009 has been met.
Current Year Equity Award:
 
Each of the above-referenced shares, was awarded under either the Companys 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan or the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, both approved by the shareholders.
