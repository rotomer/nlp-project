CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May  27, 2009  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, reported earnings per diluted share of $0.66, for the quarter ended May 2, 2009 (first quarter), an increase of 37.5% compared to the $0.48 earnings per diluted share reported for the quarter ended May 3, 2008.  Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1.20 billion, a 14.2% increase compared to $1.05 billion reported for the quarter ended May 3, 2008.  Comparable store sales increased 9.2% for the first quarter.
I am pleased with the Companys performance in the first quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  As consumers are searching for ways to balance their budgets in these uncertain times, more of them are turning to Dollar Tree and finding exceptionally high value merchandise and a fun, convenient shopping experience.  Our customer traffic once again increased in the first quarter, driving sales and earnings ahead of guidance and outstanding financial performance for our shareholders.
Operating margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter to 8.1%.  The improvement from the 6.6% operating margin in the first quarter last year was driven by a 70 basis point increase in gross margin and an 80 basis point reduction in S.G.& A. expenses.
Cash at quarter-end totaled approximately $355 million, compared with $84 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter 2008.  During the first quarter 2009, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock, for $42.7 million.
The Company continues to grow.  During the first quarter, Dollar Tree opened 79 stores, closed 3 stores, and expanded or relocated 25 stores.  Retail selling square footage increased 6.4% compared to a year ago, to 31.0 million square feet.  Total merchandise inventories increased by 5.4% compared with a year ago, while merchandise inventories on a selling square foot basis decreased 0.9%.
In April, Dollar Tree launched a redesigned website featuring a new e-commerce platform, at The new site is an extension of the great value, convenience, and fun shopping experience we have always offered in our stores, Mr. Sasser said.  Every individual online item is an incredible value at only $1.00.  This is another exciting way that we are bringing the value of Dollar Tree to consumers, small businesses, and organizations alike.
