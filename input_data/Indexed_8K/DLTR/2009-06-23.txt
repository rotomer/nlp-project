Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the person or person entitled to such notice, either before or after the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.  A stockholder who attends a meeting shall be deemed to have waived objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless at the beginning of the meeting he objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting.
 
5.          :  At all meetings of the stockholders the chairman of the Board or Directors or, in his absence, the president, shall act as chairman.

The secretary of the Corporation or, in his absence, an assistant secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of the stockholders.  In the event that neither the secretary nor any assistant secretary is present, the chairman may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF BUSINESS
The chairman shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the dismissal of business not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.
At each annual meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5.  At a special meeting of stockholders, no business shall be transacted and no corporate action taken other than that stated in the notice of the meeting.
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States certified mail, postage prepaid, and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date of the Corporation's proxy statement in connection with the last annual meeting of stockholders or if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the applicable annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, not less than 90 days before the date of the applicable annual meeting.  A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, including the complete text of any resolutions to be presented at the annual meeting, and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's stock transfer books, of such stockholder proposing such business, (c) a representation that such stockholder is a stockholder of record and intends to appear in person or by proxy at such meeting to bring the business before the meeting specified in the notice, (d) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by the stockholder and (e) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.  Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.  The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that the business was not brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed by this Section 5, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, a stockholder seeking to have a proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement shall comply with the requirements of Regulation 14a under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 or its successor provision).

No stockholder may authorize more than four persons to act for him, and any proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at or prior to the time designated by the chairman or in the order of business for so delivering such proxies.  No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Each holder of record of stock of any class shall, as to all matters in respect of which stock of such class has voting power, be entitled to such vote as is provided in the Articles of Incorporation for each share of stock of such class standing in his name on the books of the Corporation.  Unless required by statute or determined by the chairman to be advisable, the vote on any questions need not be by ballot.  On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting or by such stockholder's proxy, if there be such proxy.
VOTING
7.           :  At every meeting of the stockholders for election of directors, the proxies shall be received and taken in charge, all ballots shall be received and counted and all questions touching the qualifications of voters, the validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided, by one or more inspectors.  Each inspector shall be appointed by the chairman of the meeting, shall be sworn faithfully to perform his or her duties and shall certify in writing to the returns.  No candidate for election as director shall be appointed or act as inspector.
INSPECTORS
8.           :  At all meetings of the stockholders, unless a greater number of voting by classes is required by law, a majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum.  Treasury shares and shares held by a corporation of which the Corporation owns a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the directors thereof shall not be entitled to vote or to be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled to vote.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders unless the vote of a greater number is required by law or the Articles of Incorporation, except that in the election of directors, those receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not receiving a majority.  Less than a quorum may adjourn.  If a meeting is adjourned for lack of a quorum, any matter which might have properly come before the original meeting may come before the adjourned meeting when reconvened.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
3.          :  At each annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect the directors.  No person shall be eligible for election as a director unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at the applicable meeting of stockholders who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 3.

Alternatively, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of some or all shares of stock without certificates.  In such event, within a reasonable time after issuance, the Corporation shall mail to the shareholder a written confirmation of its records with respect to such shares containing the information required by law.

The Board of Directors of the Corporation may issue scrip in registered or bearer form, which shall entitle the holder to receive a certificate for a full share.  Scrip shall not entitle the holder to exercise voting rights or to receive dividends thereon or to participate in any of the assets of the Corporation in the event of liquidation.  The Board may cause scrip to be issued subject to the condition that it shall become void if not exchanged for certificates representing full shares before a specified date or subject to any other conditions that it may deem advisable.  Fractional may also be issued.
