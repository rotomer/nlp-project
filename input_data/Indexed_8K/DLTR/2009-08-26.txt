Comparable store sales increased 6.8% for the quarter.
Our sales continue to grow across a wide range of merchandise categories, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  Now more than ever, customers are relying on Dollar Tree for high value basic products including Health and Beauty Care, Household Supplies and Food, in addition to discretionary items including party goods, floral, toys, books and variety merchandise for all seasons.

Operating margin increased 170 basis points for the quarter to 7.3%.  The improvement was driven by a 130 basis point increase in gross margin and a 40 basis point reduction in S.G. & A. expenses.
