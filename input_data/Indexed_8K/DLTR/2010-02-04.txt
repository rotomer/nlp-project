Our sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter, said Bob Sasser, President and CEO.  Our Christmas business was better than ever and sales remained strong through the end of the quarter, as our stores executed a quick transition to Game Day and Valentines Day.  The increase in comparable-store sales for the quarter was driven principally by continued growth in traffic.  Average ticket also increased in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2009, net sales were a record $5.23 billion, a 12.6% increase compared to the $4.64 billion reported last year.  Comparable-store sales increased 7.2% for the full year 2009.  Dollar Tree sales have increased every year since the Company became public in 1995.
