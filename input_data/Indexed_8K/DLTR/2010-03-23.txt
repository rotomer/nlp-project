(e) Compensatory Arrangements.
On March 17, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree, Inc. conducted its annual review of the base salaries and incentive compensation of the Companys executive officers.
: After not increasing salaries for the Companys Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2009, the Committee approved the following annual base salaries for the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2010.
Base Salaries
:  The Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2009 which ended on January 30, 2010.  The Committee reaffirmed without change the target bonus levels of 100% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 50% of salary for the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief Logistics Officer and established the target bonus and performance goals for fiscal year 2010.  Consistent with past practice, 85% of the award is based on the Companys earnings per share and 15% is based on the officer achieving personal performance goals.  The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2009 and bonus target for fiscal 2010:
Annual Incentive Bonus for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010
The bonus target for fiscal 2010 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its earnings per share goal and the executive achieves 100% of the personal performance goals.  Within certain limits, if the Company exceeds (or does not meet) its earnings per share goal, the executives bonus can exceed (or fall below) the bonus target set forth above.
The Committee reviewed the performance requirements relating to performance-based restricted stock units awarded in fiscal 2009.  The Committee determined that the target level of earnings per share for fiscal 2009 had been met.  Bob Sasser will receive a total of 50,000 restricted stock units, Gary Philbin will receive a total of 18,000 restricted stock units, Kevin Wampler will receive a total of 15,000 restricted stock units, Robert Rudman will receive a total of 15,000 restricted stock units and Stephen White will receive a total of 8,000 restricted stock units.  These awards will vest ratably over three years, with the first third vesting on the first anniversary date of the grant (April 1, 2010), provided the named executive officers remain continuously employed through the vesting dates. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed the performance requirements relating to 15,000 performance-based restricted stock units awarded to Kevin Wampler in connection with his hiring as Chief Financial Officer. The Committee certified that the performance goal for this award had been met and the award will cliff vest at the end of fiscal 2010, provided Mr. Wampler remains continuously employed with the Company through that vesting date.
