Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Director Compensation
On June 17, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors established a new policy for director compensation based on recommendations by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The new policy offers a total compensation package that the Board believes is commensurate with other public retailers and better aligns director and shareholder interest.  The changes to director compensation are further described below.
Beginning at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board has determined that each non-employee director  that is, every director other than Macon Brock and Bob Sasser - will receive an annual retainer of $125,000, payable quarterly.  In addition, the audit committee chair will receive $30,000 and audit committee members will receive $20,000; the compensation committee chair will receive $20,000 and compensation committee members will receive $15,000; the nominating and corporate governance committee chairman will receive $15,000 and the nominating and corporate governance committee members will receive $10,000.  The Lead Director will receive an additional $35,000. Under our 2003 Director Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may elect to invest their cash fees in our common stock, options or an interest- bearing cash account.

contendere
5.           No indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V (unless ordered by a court of law) shall be made by the Corporation without a determination in the specific case that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the proposed indemnitee has met the standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to his entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification, an advance or reimbursement is claimed, any determination as to such indemnification, advance or reimbursement shall be made by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee.  If the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel, the Board of Directors and the proposed indemnitee each shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal counsel.
6.           (a) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer (and may do so for a person referred to in Section B(7) of this Article V) who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under Section B(2) of this Article V if the director, officer or person furnishes to the Corporation:
i)           a written statement, executed personally, of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct that is a prerequisite to his entitlement to indemnification under Section B(2) of this Article V; and

The provisions of Sections B(3) through B(6) of this Articl e V shall be applicable to any indemnification provided pursuant to this Section B(7).
 
 
 
8.           The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him in any such capacity or arising from his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
9.           Every reference herein to directors, officers, employees or agents shall include former directors, officers, employees and agents and their respective heirs, executors and administrators.
