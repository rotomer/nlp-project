Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 19, 2010  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), the nation's leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, reported its results for the quarter ended July 31, 2010 (second quarter).  Consolidated net sales for the second quarter were $1.38 billion, a 12.7% increase compared to $1.22 billion reported for the quarter ended August 1, 2009 (second quarter 2009).  Comparable store sales increased 6.7%, on top of a 6.8% increase for the second quarter 2009.
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were $0.61, an increase of 45% compared to the $0.42 earnings per diluted share reported for the quarter ended August 1, 2009.
Dollar Trees sales and earnings continued to expand in the second quarter, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  Sales were strong throughout the quarter, driven by increases in both traffic and average ticket.  Customers are responding in record numbers to our outstanding values and fun shopping experience.  Leading categories in the second quarter included food, health and beauty care products and party supplies.  In addition, our seasonal sell-through was on plan and our inventory is clean heading into the Fall season.
Operating margin increased 200 basis points for the quarter to 9.3%.  The improvement was driven by a 60 basis point increase in gross margin and a 140 basis point reduction in S.G. &A. expenses.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled approximately $480 million, compared with $358 million at the end of the second quarter 2009.  Year-to-date, the Company repurchased 5.6 million shares for $218.4 million, including a $200 million Accelerated Share Repurchase which was completed in early August.  The Company has $542 million remaining on its share repurchase authorization, including the additional $500 million authorized by the Companys Board of Directors in June 2010.
In addition, during the second quarter the Company executed a 3-for-2 stock split in the form of a 50% common stock dividend. All per-share data in this document reflect the impact of the stock split.
During the second quarter, Dollar Tree opened 56 stores, expanded or relocated 34 stores, and closed 5 stores.  Retail selling square footage increased 6.8% compared to a year ago, to 33.6 million square feet.
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.39 billion, based on low to mid single digit positive comparable store sales.  Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.62.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $5.77 billion to $5.86 billion.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be $2.84 to $2.96, including the impact of the non-cash, non-recurring charge in the first quarter relating to the Companys previously announced retail inventory accounting change.  Excluding the charge, diluted earnings per share for the full year 2010 are expected to be $2.97 to $3.09 compared with previous guidance of $2.86- $3.00.
