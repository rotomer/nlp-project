On October 11, 2010, DG Acquisitions (B.C.), Inc., a British Columbia corporation (Dollar Tree), an indirect subsidiary of Dollar Tree, Inc. (Company), Dollar Giant Store (B.C.) Ltd., a British Columbia corporation (Dollar Giant), Clock Holdings Ltd., a British Columbia corporation, D.V.N. Investments Inc., an Ontario corporation, Calvano Holdings Ltd., a British Columbia corporation, and Graham MacKenzie, Antonio Calvano, and Joseph Calvano entered into a definitive purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) providing for Dollar Tree to acquire substantially all of the assets of Dollar Giant.  This is the Companys first expansion of its retail operations outside of the United States.
Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Dollar Giant stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise, contemporary seasonal goods and everyday consumables, all priced at $1.25 or less.  The stores average 9,000 gross square feet and operate in British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was approximately $3.0 million (CAD).
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Dollar Tree would acquire 85 Dollar Giant stores and substantially all of Dollar Giants other assets, inventory, leasehold rights and certain intellectual property (as further defined in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchased Assets).  In consideration of the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets to Dollar Tree and of the agreement by Dollar Giant to perform each of the other obligations hereunder, Dollar Giant will be paid a purchase price estimated to equal approximately $52,000,000 (CAD), which is the Enterprise Value reduced by the sum of Adjusted Permanent Debt and the amount, if any, of the Net Current Asset Deficit and Inventory Deficit as defined in the Purchase Agreement.  The Purchase Agreement is subject to certain standard closing condi tions, representations and warranties, terminations provisions, and indemnification provisions.  No governmental approvals or consents are required to consummate the purchase.
 
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report, and such agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Purchase Agreement and the above description of the Purchase Agreement have been included to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Purchase Agreement. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Dollar Tree, Dollar Giant or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Purchase Agreement; and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made by each contracting party to the other for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between them that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Dollar Tree, Dollar Giant, or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties, and covenants may change after the date of the Purchase Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company, Dollar Tree or Dollar Giant. Accordingly, investors should read the representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement not in isolation but only in conjunction with the other information about the Company, Dollar Tree or Dollar Giant and their respective subsidiaries that the respective companies include in reports, statements, and other filings they make with the SEC.
