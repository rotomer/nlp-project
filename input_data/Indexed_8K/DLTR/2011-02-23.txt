Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  February 23, 2011  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), North Americas  leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, today reported results for the quarter and fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 (fourth quarter).
Fourth Quarter Results
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.73 billion, a 10.7% increase compared to $1.56 billion reported for the quarter ended January 30, 2010 (fourth quarter 2009).  Comparable store sales increased 3.9%, on top of a 6.6% increase for the fourth quarter 2009.
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.29, an increase of 27.7% compared to the $1.01 earnings per diluted share reported for the quarter ended January 30, 2010.
Dollar Tree delivered record sales and earnings in both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  I am particularly pleased by our operating margin, which expanded by 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and 140 basis points for the full year.  Our inventory turns also increased in 2010, for the sixth consecutive year.
Our fourth quarter sales were strongest in the Southwest and the Southeast.  Traffic continues to grow as more customers are responding to Dollar Trees excellent values, balanced merchandise assortment and convenient shopping experience.
Operating margin increased 100 basis points for the quarter to 15.0%.  The improvement was driven by a 50 basis point increase in gross margin and a 50 basis point reduction in Selling, General and Administrative expenses.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $486.0 million, compared with $599.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2009.  During the fourth quarter 2010, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for $123.9 million.  During the full Fiscal Year 2010, the Company repurchased 9.3 million shares for $414.7 million, and has $345.9 million remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
During the fourth quarter, Dollar Tree opened 19 stores, acquired 86 stores in Canada, and closed 13 stores.  Retail selling square footage increased 8.8% compared to a year ago, to 35.1 million square feet.
Full Year Results
For Fiscal Year 2010, the Companys consolidated net sales were $5.88 billion, a 12.4% increase compared with 2009 sales of $5.23 billion.  Comparable store sales increased 6.3%, on top of a 7.2% increase last year.
As previously disclosed, in the first quarter this year we recorded a nonrecurring, non-cash charge of $26.3 million, or $0.13 cents per share relating to a retail inventory accounting change.  Including this charge our earnings for the full year 2010 increased to a record $3.10 per diluted share.  Excluding the charge, earnings per diluted share were $3.23, an increase of 36% compared with $2.37 per diluted share reported last year.
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the first quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $1.48 - $1.52 billion, based on positive low -to- mid single digit comparable store sales, and 8.2% square footage growth.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.77.  The Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.49 in the first quarter 2010, including the aforementioned non-cash charge relating to the inventory accounting change.  Absent this charge, earnings per diluted share for the first quarter 2010 were $0.61.
For the full year, the Company estimates sales will range from $6.43 - $6.60 billion.  This estimate is based on a range of low -to -mid single digit positive comparable-store sales, and square footage growth of approximately 6.9% for the year.  Fiscal year 2011 diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.76.  These estimates assume no impact from potential additional share repurchase activity in 2011.
Conference Call
On Wednesday, February 23, 2011, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EST.  The telephone number for the call is 888-215-6895.
