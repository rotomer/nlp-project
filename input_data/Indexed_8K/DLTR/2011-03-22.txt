Base Salaries
:  The Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2010 which ended on January 29, 2011. Cash bonuses are awarded under the Companys 2004 Executive Officer Cash Bonus Plan, approved by shareholders, and the Management Incentive Compensation Plan, as applicable.  The Committee approved the target bonus levels of 120% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 70% of salary for the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief People Officer and established the target bonus and performance goals for fiscal year 2011.  Consistent with past practice, 85% of the awar d is based on the Companys corporate performance achievement and 15% is based on the officer achieving personal performance goals.  The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2010 and bonus target for fiscal 2011:
Annual Incentive Bonus for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011
The bonus target for fiscal 2011 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its corporate performance goal and the executive achieves 100% of the personal performance goals.  Within certain limits, if the Company exceeds (or does not meet) its goal, the executives bonus can exceed (or fall below) the bonus target set forth above.
The Committee reviewed the performance requirements relating to performance-based restricted stock units awarded in fiscal 2010.  The Committee determined that the target level of earnings per share for fiscal 2010 had been met.  Bob Sasser will receive a total of 75,000 restricted stock units, Gary Philbin will receive a total of 27,000 restricted stock units, Kevin Wampler will receive a total of 22,500 restricted stock units, Robert Rudman will receive a total of 22,500 restricted stock units and James Fothergill will receive a total of 12,000 restricted stock units.  The share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split that took effect on June 24, 2010.These awards will vest ratably over three years, with the first third vesting on the first anniversary date of the grant (March 26, 2011), provided the Named Executive Officers remain continuously employed through the vesting dates.

The Committee approved the dollar value of performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain Named Executive Officers of the Company, effective April 1, 2011.  The Committee approved the dollar value of restricted stock units in the amount of $3,000,000 to Bob Sasser; $1,100,000 to Gary Philbin; $775,000 to Kevin Wampler; $900,000 to Robert Rudman; and $415,000 to James Fothergill.  The number of restricted stock units will be calculated by dividing the dollar value of the award by the fair market value of a share of Dollar Tree stock on April 1, 2011, and rounded down to the nearest five shares. The units vest ratably over three years in one year increments and are subject to the Company achieving a certain corporate performa nce goal in fiscal 2011.
Current Year Equity Award:
Each of the above-referenced shares, was awarded under either the Companys 2004 Executive Officer Equity Plan or the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as applicable, both approved by the shareholders.
