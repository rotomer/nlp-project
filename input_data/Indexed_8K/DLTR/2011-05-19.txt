Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 19, 2011  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), North Americas leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, reported its results for the quarter ended April 30, 2011 (first quarter).  Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1.55 billion, a 14.3% increase compared to $1.35 billion reported for the quarter ended May 1, 2010 (first quarter 2010).  Comparable store sales increased 7.1%, on top of a 6.5% increase for the first quarter 2010.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter were $0.82, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.49 reported for the quarter ended May 1, 2010, which included a non-recurring, non-cash charge of $26.3 million relating to a retail inventory accounting change in the first quarter 2010.  The Companys earnings per diluted share of $0.82 in the first quarter 2011 were an increase of 34.4% compared to the first quarter 2010 earnings per diluted share of $0.61, absent the charge.
I am pleased by Dollar Trees continuing growth in sales and earnings, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  Our business momentum was strong throughout the first quarter.  Seasonal performance was outstanding from Valentines through Easter.  Both traffic and ticket increased as more customers continue to rely on Dollar Tree for great merchandise values and a fun, convenient shopping experience.
The 7.1% comp-store sales increase following strong first quarter growth for the past two years is further validation of Dollar Trees efforts to find more ways to provide more value to more customers every day.
Operating margin for the quarter was 10.5%, a 290 basis point improvement from the 7.6% operating margin in the first quarter 2010, and a 100 basis point improvement from the 9.5% operating margin in the first quarter 2010, absent the aforementioned charge in the first quarter last year.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $510.3 million, compared with $390.1 million at the end of the first quarter 2010.  During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares for $88.6 million, and has $257.4 million remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
The Company continues to grow. During the first quarter, Dollar Tree opened 83 stores, closed 7 stores, and expanded or relocated 41 stores.  Retail selling square footage increased 9.0% compared to a year ago, to 36.0 million square feet.
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the second quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.55 billion, based on low to- mid single digit positive comparable store sales.  Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.75.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $6.50 billion to $6.63 billion.  This estimate is based on a range of low to- mid single digit positive comparable store sales.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be $3.69 to $3.85.  The Company reported earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 of $3.10, which includes the impact of the aforementioned charge.  Excluding the charge, earnings per diluted share were $3.23 for fiscal 2010.
