Exhibit 99.1 - Press release dated August 18, 2011 issued by Dollar Tree, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  August 18, 2011  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), North Americas leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, reported its results for the quarter ended July 30, 2011 (second quarter).  Consolidated net sales for the second quarter were $1.54 billion, an 11.9% increase compared to $1.38 billion reported for the quarter ended July 31, 2010 (second quarter 2010).  Comparable store sales increased 4.7%, on top of a 6.7% increase for the second quarter 2010.
Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were $0.77, an increase of 26.2% compared to the $0.61 earnings per diluted share reported for the quarter ended July 31, 2010.
I am pleased with our second quarter performance as sales, earnings and operating margins continue to expand, President and CEO Bob Sasser said.  Increases in customer traffic and average ticket drove our sales growth, which was strongest in the latter half of the quarter.  Our operating margin continued to improve even with significantly higher energy prices throughout the quarter relative to last year.  Earnings continue to grow and our stores are executing at a high level.  We transitioned quickly from Summer Fun to back-to-school and are ready for the fall selling season.
Operating margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter to 10.0%.  The improvement was driven by a 10 basis point increase in gross margin and a 60 basis point reduction in S.G. &A. expenses.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled approximately $545 million, compared with $480 million at the end of the second quarter 2010.  During the second quarter, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares for $8.2 million, and has $249.2 million remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
The Company continues to grow.  During the second quarter, Dollar Tree opened 76 stores, expanded or relocated 23 stores, and closed 11 stores.  Retail selling square footage increased 8.9% compared to a year ago, to 36.6 million square feet.
26-Week Period Results
Year-to-date through July 30, 2011, the Companys consolidated net sales were $3.09 billion, a 13.1% increase compared with the first half of 2010.  Comparable store sales increased 5.9%, on top of a 6.6% comparable store sales increase in the first half last year.
First half 2011 earnings per share were $1.59, compared with earnings per share of $1.10 in the first half 2010.  As we have previously disclosed, in the first quarter 2010 we recorded a nonrecurring, non-cash charge of $26.3 million relating to a retail inventory accounting change.  Excluding this charge our earnings in the first half 2010 were $1.22.  Earnings per share of $1.59 in the first half 2011 were an increase of 30.3% over the first half 2010, excluding the charge in the first quarter last year.
Operating margin in the first half 2011 was 10.2%, an increase of 80 basis points from operating margin of 9.4% in the first half 2010, excluding the charge in the first quarter 2010.
 
 
 
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the third quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.60 billion, based on low single digit positive comparable store sales.  Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.83.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $6.53 billion to $6.62 billion.  Diluted earnings per share are expected to be $3.82 to $3.95.  The Company reported earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 of $3.10, including the aforementioned non-recurring, non-cash charge in the first quarter 2010.  Excluding the charge, earnings per diluted share were $3.23 for fiscal 2010.
