Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.87, an increase of 19.2% compared to the $0.73 earnings per diluted share reported for the quarter ended October 30, 2010.
"I am very pleased with the Companys performance in the third quarter," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. Dollar Tree achieved double-digit growth in sales, operating margin and earnings per share against a very strong performance last year.  Our merchandising and store teams continue to deliver exciting products at great values and a fun, friendly, convenient shopping experience for our customers.
Operating margin increased 40 basis points for the quarter to 10.3%.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $280.2 million, compared with $392.0 million at the end of the third quarter 2010. During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 3.3 million shares for $249.1 million. Year-to-date, the Company repurchased 5.2 million shares for $345.9 million.  The Company has $1.5 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
During the third quarter, Dollar Tree opened 98 stores, expanded or relocated 24 stores, and closed 5 stores. Retail selling square footage increased 8.7% compared to a year ago, to 37.4 million square feet.
39-Week Period Results
Year-to-date through the three quarters ended October 29, 2011, the Company's consolidated net sales were $4.68 billion, a 12.7% increase compared with the same period in 2010. Comparable store sales increased 5.5%, on top of a 7.3% increase through three quarters last year.
Year-to-date earnings per diluted share were $2.45, compared with earnings per diluted share of $1.82 through three quarters last year. As we have previously disclosed, in the first quarter 2010 we recorded a nonrecurring, non-cash charge of $26.3 million relating to a retail inventory accounting change. Excluding this charge our earnings through three quarters last year were $1.95.
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.90 billion, based on low to mid single digit positive comparable store sales. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.49 to $1.56.
 
 
 
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $6.57 billion to $6.62 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be $3.94 to $4.01. The Company reported earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010 of $3.10, including the aforementioned non-recurring, non-cash charge in the first quarter 2010.  Excluding the charge, earnings per diluted share were $3.23 for fiscal 2010.
