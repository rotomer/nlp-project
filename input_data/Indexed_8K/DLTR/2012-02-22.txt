CHESAPEAKE, Va.  February 22, 2012  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), North Americas  leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, today reported results for the  fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 (fourth quarter 2011 and fiscal year 2011).
Fourth Quarter Results
Consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $1.95 billion, a 12.8% increase compared to $1.73 billion reported for the quarter ended January 29, 2011 (fourth quarter 2010). Comparable store sales increased 7.3%, on top of a 3.9% increase for the fourth quarter 2010.
Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.60, an increase of 24.0% compared to the $1.29 earnings per diluted share reported for the fourth quarter 2010.
I am pleased to report that our business momentum remains strong as Dollar Trees sales, operating margin, and earnings continued to expand in the fourth quarter, said President and CEO Bob Sasser.  Dollar Tree is focused on providing a broad, balanced assortment of merchandise that customers need and want at surprising values. Our stores are clean, bright, convenient, seasonally relevant and fun to shop. We are looking forward to an exciting Spring and Easter selling season.
 
 
Operating margin increased 50 basis points for the quarter to 15.5%.  The improvement was driven by a 20 basis point increase in gross margin and a 30 basis point reduction in Selling, General and Administrative expenses.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $288.3 million, compared with $486.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2010. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 3.5 million shares for $300.0 million. During the full fiscal year 2011, the Company repurchased 8.7 million shares for $645.9 million, and has $1.2 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
During the fourth quarter, Dollar Tree opened 21 stores, expanded or relocated 3 stores, and closed 5 stores. Retail selling square footage increased 6.9% compared to a year ago, to 37.6 million square feet.
Full Year Results
For fiscal year 2011, the Companys consolidated net sales were $6.63 billion, a 12.7% increase compared with 2010 sales of $5.88 billion. Comparable store sales increased 6.0%, on top of a 6.3% increase last year.  Diluted earnings per share were $4.03, an increase of 30.0% from diluted earnings per share of $3.10 in 2010. As we have previously disclosed, in the first quarter 2010 we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash charge of $26.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, relating to a retail inventory accounting change.  Excluding this charge our earnings for fiscal 2010 were $3.23 per diluted share.
 
 
 
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the first quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion, based on low -to- mid single digit positive comparable-store sales, and 7.0% square footage growth. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.97.
For the full year, the Company estimates sales will range from $7.25 billion to $7.42 billion.  This estimate is based on a range of low -to -mid single digit positive comparable-store sales, and square footage growth of approximately 7.2% for the year. Fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.90. These estimates assume no impact from potential additional share repurchase activity in 2012.  In addition, 2012 will include a 53 week that will be recorded in the fourth quarter 2012. The extra week is expected to add $120 million to $130 million to sales in the fourth quarter 2012 and $0.13 to $0.15 earnings per diluted share, both of which are included in our guidance.
