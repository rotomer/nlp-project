(e) Compensatory Arrangements.
On March 15, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Dollar Tree, Inc. (the Company) conducted its annual review of the base salaries and incentive compensation of the Companys executive officers.
:  The Committee approved the following annual base salaries for the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2012.
Base Salaries
:  The Committee authorized the payment of annual cash bonus awards to certain of the Companys Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2011 which ended on January 28, 2012. Cash bonuses are awarded under the Companys shareholder approved Omnibus Incentive Plan and under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan, as applicable.  The Committee also approved the fiscal 2012 target bonus levels of 120% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 70% of salary for the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Merchandising Officer and Chief Logistics Officer and established the performance goals for fiscal year 2012.  Consistent with past practice, 85% of the award is based on the Companys corporate performance achievement and 15% is based on the officer achieving individual performance goals.  The following table sets forth the bonus payments for fiscal 2011 and bonus target for fiscal 2012:
Annual Incentive Bonus for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012
The bonus target for fiscal 2012 assumes that the Company achieves 100% of its corporate performance goal and the executive achieves 100% of the individual performance goals.  Within certain limits, if the Company exceeds (or does not meet) its goal, the executives bonus can exceed (or fall below) the bonus target set forth above.
The Committee reviewed the performance requirements relating to performance-based restricted stock units awarded to our Named Executive Officers on April 1, 2011 and described in the Companys Form 8-K filed on March 22, 2011.  The Committee determined that the target level of operating income for fiscal 2011 had been met for these awards.
Prior Year Equity Awards:  
 
 
 
The Committee approved the dollar value of performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain Named Executive Officers of the Company, effective March 30, 2012.  The Committee approved the dollar value of restricted stock units in the amount of $3,500,000 to Bob Sasser; $1,200,000 to Gary Philbin; $836,000 to Kevin Wampler; $1,000,000 to Robert Rudman; and $447,000 to Stephen White.  The number of restricted stock units will be calculated by dividing the dollar value of the award by the fair market value of a share of Dollar Tree stock on March 30, 2012, and rounded down to the nearest five shares. The awards will be issued pursuant to the Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and will be subject to the Company achieving a certain corporate performance goal in fiscal 2012. The units will vest ratably over three years provided the performance goal is achieved and the vesting conditions set forth in the Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement are met.
Current Year Equity Award:
The Committee also approved the following long-term performance plan target award values, to be effective on March 30, 2012 to the following Named Executive Officers:  Bob Sasser, $600,000; Gary Philbin, $450,000; Kevin Wampler, $400,000; Robert Rudman, $400,000; Stephen White, $300,000.  The target award is divided equally between cash and restricted stock units and the target number of restricted stock units will be calculated by dividing the target restricted stock unit award value by the fair market value of a share of Dollar Tree stock on March 30, 2012.  Each Named Executive Officer will have the opportunity to earn an amount between zero percent (0%) and two hundred percent (200%) of his individual target award based on performance against the three-year cumulative operating income goal for the performance period beginning on January 29, 2012 and ending on January 31, 2015.  The award vests at the end of the performance period upon certification that performance was met. Each of these awards was issued pursuant to an agreement between the Company and the applicable Named Executive Officer conforming to the Form of Long-Term Performance Plan Award Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
Each of the above-referenced shares, was awarded under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, approved by the shareholders. The Form of Long-Term Performance Plan Award Agreement and the
Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement were adopted by the Compensation Committee for use under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Taxes; Withholding Obligation
.
 
8.1.
 
. Grantee shall be ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Awards, regardless of any action a Member Company takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Awards. The Member Companies make no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Awards or the subsequent sale of shares of Stock issuable pursuant to the Awards. Neither the Company nor any Member Company is committed or under any obligation to structure the Awards to reduce or eliminate Grantees tax liability.
Generally
 
8.2.
 
.
Payment of Withholding Taxes
 
8.2.1.
 
Prior to any event in connection with the Awards (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any employment or social tax obligation (the ), Grantee must arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company.
Tax Withholding Obligation
 
8.2.2.
 
Unless Grantee chooses to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with Section 8.2.3. below, Grantees acceptance of the Award of the Restricted Stock Units constitutes Grantees instruction and authorization to the Company, and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose, to sell on Grantees behalf (including to the Company or any affiliate of the Company through the retention of a portion of the shares of Stock) a whole number of shares of Stock from those shares of Stock issuable to Grantee pursuant to the Award of the Restricted Stock Units as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares of Stock will be sold on the day the Tax Withholding Obligation arises or as soon thereafter as practicable. If applicable, Grantee will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Grantees Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Grantee through payroll as soon as practicable. Grantee acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy Grantees Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Grantee agrees to pay to the Company (or Member Company as applicable) as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares of Stock described above.
 
 
 
 
8.2.3.
 
At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises Grantee may elect to satisfy his or her Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company (or Member Company as applicable) an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company (or Member Company as applicable), or (iii) such other means as the Company may establish or permit.
 
8.2.4.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Stock to Grantee until Grantee satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company has the right to retain, without notice, from shares of Stock issuable under the Awards or from salary or other amounts payable to Grantee, shares of Stock or cash having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation.

  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of a Member Company to terminate Grantees employment for any reason, with or without Cause.
No Employment

. Grantee shall be ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Award, regardless of any action a Member Company takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Award.

Payment of Withholding Taxes
 
7.2.1.
 
Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any employment or social tax obligation (the ), Grantee must arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company.
Tax Withholding Obligation
 
7.2.2.
 
Unless Grantee chooses to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by some other means in accordance with Section 7.2.3. below, Grantees acceptance of this Award constitutes Grantees instruction and authorization to the Company, and any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose, to sell on Grantees behalf (including to the Company or any affiliate of the Company through the retention of a portion of the shares of Stock) a whole number of shares of Stock from those shares of Stock issuable to Grantee as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. Such shares of Stock will be sold on the day the Tax Withholding Obligation arises or as soon thereafter as practicable. If applicable, Grantee will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale. To the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed Grantees Tax Withholding Obligation, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to Grantee through payroll as soon as practicable. Grantee acknowledges that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may not be sufficient to satisfy your Tax Withholding Obligation. Accordingly, Grantee agrees to pay to the Company (or Member Company as applicable) as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax Withholding Obligation that is not satisfied by the sale of shares of Stock described above.
 
 
 
 
7.2.3.
 
At any time not less than five (5) business days before any Tax Withholding Obligation arises Grantee may elect to satisfy his or her Tax Withholding Obligation by delivering to the Company (or Member Company as applicable) an amount that the Company determines is sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by (i) wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, (ii) delivery of a certified check payable to the Company (or Member Company as applicable), or (iii) such other means as the Company may establish or permit.
 
7.2.4.
 
The Company may refuse to issue any shares of Stock to Grantee until Grantee satisfies the Tax Withholding Obligation.
