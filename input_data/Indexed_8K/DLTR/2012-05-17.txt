PRESS RELEASE
CHESAPEAKE, Va.  May 17, 2012  Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR), North Americas leading operator of discount variety stores selling everything for $1 or less, reported its results for the quarter ended April 28, 2012 (first quarter). Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $1.72 billion, an 11.5% increase compared to $1.55 billion reported for the quarter ended April 30, 2011 (first quarter 2011). Comparable store sales increased 5.6%, on top of a 7.1% increase for the first quarter 2011.
Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter were $1.00, a 22.0% increase compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.82 reported for the quarter ended April 30, 2011.
"I am pleased with the first quarter results as both sales and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance," said President and CEO Bob Sasser. "The top performing categories for the quarter included Home products; Food, snacks and beverage; Health care products; Party supplies; Household cleaning supplies; and Seasonal merchandise. Inventory turns increased in the first quarter and we entered the second quarter in stock and well prepared, with our shelves full of the right product for our customers.
Operating margin for the quarter was 10.9%, a 40 basis point improvement from the 10.5% operating margin in the first quarter 2011.
Cash and investments at quarter-end totaled $382.3 million, compared with $510.3 million at the end of the first quarter 2011. During the first quarter, the Company completed its $300 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program and repurchased an additional 49 thousand shares on the open market for $4.5 million, and ended the quarter with $1.2 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization.
The Company continues to grow. During the first quarter, Dollar Tree opened 110 stores, closed 10 stores, and expanded or relocated 44 stores. Retail selling square footage increased 7.1% compared to a year ago, to 38.6 million square feet.
Guidance
The Company estimates sales for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $1.66 billion to $1.70 billion, based on low to- mid single digit positive comparable store sales. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.93.
Full year sales are now estimated to be in the range of $7.33 billion to $7.46 billion. This estimate is based on a range of low to- mid single digit positive comparable store sales. Fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share are expected to be $4.74 to $4.94. These estimates assume no impact from potential additional share repurchase activity in 2012. In addition, 2012 will include a 53rd week that will be recorded in the fourth quarter 2012. The extra week is expected to add $120 million to $130 million to sales in the fourth quarter 2012 and $0.13 to $0.15 earnings per diluted share, both of which are included in our guidance.
 
 
 
On Thursday, May 17, 2012, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 9:00 a.m. EDT.  The telephone number for the call is 888-224-1075.  A recorded version of the call will be available until midnight Thursday, May 24, and may be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112, and the access code is 3204362.
