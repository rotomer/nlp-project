PRESS RELEASE
D&B Announces 2003 Second Quarter Results
Short Hills, NJ  July 22, 2003  D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information and technology solutions, today reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, of 50 cents, up 19 percent from 42 cents in the prior year quarter, before non-core charges in both periods. On a GAAP basis, D&B reported diluted earnings per share of 46 cents, compared with 14 cents in the second quarter of 2002. The non-core charges are described below.
See Schedule 1 for results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Schedule 2 for results before non-core gains and charges, and Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of GAAP results to results before non-core gains and charges. Also see below for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures.
"In the second quarter, we reported solid EPS growth and continued to deliver value for our shareholders as we transform our company," said Allan Z. Loren, chairman and chief executive officer of D&B. "Our revenue growth put us back on track in terms of the revenue trend we established in 2002."
"Our organic performance improved in North America, and our recent acquisitions - - Hoover's and Data House  performed well," Loren continued. "These improvements are due to better leadership by our team members, and
 
PRESS RELEASE
better execution of our strategy. We continue to face some challenges. We're still not where we need to be in Europe. But we are taking actions that we believe will drive improved revenue performance in that region in the second half of the year."
D&B's Second Quarter 2003 Results
Total revenue for the quarter was $335 million, a 10 percent increase compared with the prior year quarter, including 6 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements and 5 percentage points of favorable impact from the Company's acquisitions.
These revenue results reflect the following by product line:
D&B continued to make progress in migrating its product delivery to the Web, a more efficient delivery channel. In the second quarter of 2003, D&B delivered 72 percent of its revenue over the Web, up from 68 percent in the first quarter of 2003, and from 65 percent at the end of 2002. As of second quarter, the company has met its target to deliver more than 70 percent of its revenue over the Web by the end of the year.
 
PRESS RELEASE
Operating income for the second quarter was $66.0 million, up $4.3 million or 7 percent from the year ago period, before non-core charges in both periods, primarily due to the increased revenue. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $61.1 million in the second quarter of 2003, up $30.3 million from $30.8 million in the second quarter of 2002. GAAP results include $4.9 million of non-core charges in 2003 and $30.9 million in 2002.
Net income for the quarter was $38.7 million, up $6.2 million or 19 percent from the prior-year period, before non-core charges in both years. On a GAAP basis, net income was $35.1 million, compared with $10.9 million in the second quarter of 2002.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the quarter was $70.0 million. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was up 24%, and the Company ended the quarter with $127.4 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Second Quarter 2003 Segment Results
North America
North America's second quarter revenue was $229.3 million, up $14.1 million or 7 percent from $215.2 million in the prior year period, including 1 percent from the favorable impact of foreign exchange related to the Company's Canadian business. The increase reflects the acquisition of Hoover's, Inc. on March 3, 2003, which contributed 4 percentage points of growth. Organic revenue in North America grew 2 percent in the quarter.
North America's revenue results include:
 
PRESS RELEASE
North America's operating income for the quarter was $68.4 million, up $2.4 million or 4 percent from $66.0 million in the prior year quarter.
International
The International segment's second-quarter revenue was $105.7 million, up $15.3 million or 17 percent from $90.4 million in the prior year quarter. The International revenue results were impacted by the favorable effect of foreign exchange rate movements, which contributed 18 percentage points of growth. Before the effect of foreign exchange, revenue was down 1 percent, including 7 percentage points of growth from acquisitions, primarily Data House S.p.A., acquired in October 2002.
These International revenue results reflect:
The International segment's operating income for the quarter was $16.4 million, compared with operating income of $14.1 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 16 percent. The increase in operating income was due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.
See Schedule 4 for revenue by product line for each geographic segment and other supplemental information.
First-Half Results
The Company reported diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2003 of $1.02, up 17 cents or 20 percent from a year ago, before non-core items in both
 
PRESS RELEASE
periods. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of 94 cents compared with 57 cents in 2002, an increase of 65 percent. Total revenue for the period was $649.7 million, a 5 percent increase over the same period last year, including 5 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements and 4 percentage points of favorable impact from the Company's acquisitions.
Operating income for the six-month period was $132.5 million, up $11.8 million, or 10 percent from the same period in 2002, before non-core items in both periods. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $116.7 million, up 30 percent from $89.8 million. GAAP results include $15.8 million of non-core charges in 2003 and $30.9 million in 2002.
First-Half Segment Results
For the 2003 first half, North America's core revenue was $455.8 million, essentially flat compared with $454.9 million in the first six months of 2002, including 2 percentage points of favorable impact from acquisitions. Operating income was $148.7 million, up $2.5 million, or 2 percent over last year.
First half core revenue from the International segment was $193.9 million, up 17 percent or $28.7 million from last year including 17 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements and 7 percentage points of favorable impact from acquisitions. Operating income was $17.7 million, up 74 percent from $10.1 million in the year ago period. This improvement in profitability was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the lower expense base associated with the Company's financial flexibility program.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
The Company recorded a $4.9 million non-core charge during the second quarter, related to a series of financial flexibility initiatives announced and initiated in the first quarter of 2003. This series of initiatives is expected to initially reduce D&B's 2003 expense base by $75 million on an annualized basis, before any restructuring charges and transition costs, and before any reallocation of spending. The charge has been recorded within Operating income as Corporate and other expense.
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are incurred as part of each phase of its financial flexibility initiatives. However, in addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because it does not consider these charges and other items to reflect its underlying business performance. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.
2003 Outlook
Earnings Per Share and Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The Company is re-confirming its previous full-year diluted earnings per share guidance of between $2.25 and $2.29 on a GAAP basis. This range of EPS represents between 20 and 22 percent growth, compared to $1.87 reported on a GAAP basis for 2002.
This EPS guidance includes the previously-announced 8 cent per share dilutive impact of the Hoover's acquisition, and certain previously announced non-core gains and charges totaling 25 cents per share, including approximately 17 cents per share expected in the third quarter from the monetization of real estate.
Before non-core gains and charges, D&B continues to expect full-year diluted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.54, representing between 16 and 18 percent growth, compared to $2.15 of diluted earnings per share before a restructuring charge of 28 cents per share in 2002.
The Company continues to expect net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 to be between $232 million and $272 million, before any payments in settlement of tax or legal matters described in D&B's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because D&B is unable to predict the amount or timing of any such future payments, the Company is unable to provide an outlook for 2003 net cash provided by operating activities on a GAAP basis. Net cash provided by operating activities was $213.1 million in 2002.
 
PRESS RELEASE
Revenue and Other Metrics
D&B continues to believe full-year core revenue growth will be in the range of 1 to 4 percent before the effects of foreign exchange. Because D&B is unable to predict the future movements of foreign exchange rates or potential business model changes, the Company is unable to provide an outlook for 2003 revenue on a GAAP basis.
The Company also re-confirms:
Expectations for capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expense and product delivery over the Web remain unchanged from previous expectations.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. Specifically, D&B reports core revenue, revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges.

Business  How We Evaluate Our Performance" for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
