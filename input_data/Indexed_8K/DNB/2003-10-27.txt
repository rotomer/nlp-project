D&B Announces 2003 Third Quarter Results
Short Hills, NJ October 27, 2003  D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information and technology solutions, today reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, of 54 cents, up 20 percent from 45 cents in the prior year quarter, before non-core gains and charges. On a GAAP basis, D&B reported diluted earnings per share of 38 cents, compared with 45 cents in the third quarter of 2002. The non-core gains and charges are described below and in the schedules accompanying this release.
"In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our journey to transform D&B," said Allan Z. Loren, chairman and chief executive officer of D&B. "We experienced growth across all product lines in the quarter. Our improved revenue growth reflects the strength of D&B's customer value propositions, fuelled by our DUNSRight quality process."
"By continuing to leverage DUNSRight, and with our team members' ongoing focus on improved leadership, we remain confident that we will achieve our aspiration to become a growth company with an important presence on the Web," Loren said.
D&B's Third Quarter 2003 Results
Core revenue for the quarter was $330.3 million, an 11 percent increase compared with the prior year quarter, including 4 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements. The core revenue results reflect the following by product line:
Total revenue for the quarter, which includes the results of divested businesses, was $332.3 million, an 11 percent increase over total revenue in the year ago quarter.
Revenue from the Company's recent acquisitions contributed 5 percentage points to the core revenue increase, with 3 percentage points from Hoover's, acquired in the first quarter of 2003 and 2 percentage points from Data House, acquired in the third quarter of 2002, and the three Italian real estate information companies acquired in the second quarter of 2003, which are reported as part of the Risk Management Solutions revenue in the International segment.
D&B continued to make progress in migrating its product delivery to the Web. In the third quarter of 2003, D&B delivered 74 percent of its revenue over the Web, up from 72 percent in the second quarter of 2003, and from 65 percent at the end of 2002.
Operating income for the third quarter was $69.5 million, up 18 percent from the year ago period, before non-core gains and charges, primarily due to the increased revenue and the lower expense base associated with the Company's financial flexibility programs. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $54.1 million in the third quarter of 2003, down from $58.8 million in the third quarter of 2002, due to $15.4 million of non-core gains and charges in 2003. There were no non-core gains and changes in the comparable period of 2002.
Net income for the quarter was $41.3 million, up 19 percent from $34.7 million in the prior-year period, before non-core gains and charges. On a GAAP basis, net income was $28.8 million, compared with $34.7 million in the third quarter of 2002 due to the non-core gains and charges in 2003.
Net cash provided by operating activities during the quarter was $25.6 million. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was up 17 percent, and the Company ended the quarter with $199.7 million of cash and cash equivalents.
During the quarter the Company repurchased $40 million of its common stock under the $100 million program approved by its Board of Directors in October 2002. Year-to-date the Company has repurchased $70 million under the program. The Company remains on track to complete its $100 million share repurchase program by the end of 2003.
Third Quarter 2003 Segment Results
North America
North America's third quarter core revenue was $229.2 million, up 8 percent from $212.2 million in the prior year period. North America's revenue results include:
o       $149.5 million from Risk Management Solutions, up 2 percent; o       $63.7 million from Sales & Marketing Solutions, up 6 percent; o       $7.7 million from Supply Management Solutions, up 38 percent; and o       $8.3 million from E-Business Solutions, which represents the results of Hoover's, Inc.
North America's operating income for the quarter was $75.3 million, up 11 percent from $67.6 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the increased revenue.
International
The International segment's third-quarter core revenue was $101.1 million, up 20 percent from $84.3 million in the prior year quarter. The International revenue results were impacted by the favorable effect of foreign exchange rate movements, which contributed 14 percentage points of growth. Before the effect of foreign exchange, revenue was up 6 percent. These International revenue results reflect:
Total revenue for the International segment for the quarter, which includes the results of divested businesses, was $103.1 million, up 19 percent from $86.7 million in the prior year quarter.
The International segment's operating income for the quarter was $10.8 million, compared with operating income of $7.8 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 42 percent. This improvement in profitability was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, as well as the increased revenue and the lower expense base associated with the Company's financial flexibility program.
Nine Month Results
The Company reported diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2003 of $1.56, up 19 percent from a year ago, before non-core gains and charges. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.32 compared with $1.03 in 2002. Core revenue for the period was $978.7 million, a 7 percent increase over the same period last year, including 5 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements. Total revenue, which includes the results of divested businesses, was $982 million, a 7 percent increase over total revenue in the year ago quarter.
Operating income for the nine-month period was $202 million, up 13 percent from the same period in 2002, before non-core gains and charges. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $170.8 million, compared with $148.6 million in the same period last year. GAAP results include $31.2 million of non-core gains and charges in 2003 and $30.9 million in 2002.
Nine Month Segment Results
For the 2003 year-to-date period, North America's core revenue was $685 million, up 3 percent compared with $667.1 million in the first nine months of 2002. Operating income was $224 million, up 5 percent over last year.
Year-to-date core revenue from the International segment was $293.7 million, up 19 percent from last year including 17 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements. Total revenue was $297 million, up 18 percent from last year, including 16 percentage points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements. Operating income was $28.5 million, up 60 percent from $17.9 million in the year ago period.
See Schedule 1 for results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Schedule 2 for results before non-core gains and charges, and Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of GAAP results to results before non-core gains and charges. See Schedule 4 for revenue by product line for each geographic segment and other supplemental information. Also see below for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
The Company recorded non-core charges of $15.4 million during the third quarter of 2003. The charges include $13.8 million related to the previously announced monetization of real estate, and $1.6 million related to a series of financial flexibility initiatives announced and initiated in the first quarter of 2003. The charges have been recorded within Operating income as Corporate and other expense.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are incurred as part of each phase of its financial flexibility initiatives. However, in addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because it does not consider these charges and other similar items to reflect its underlying business performance. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.
Full Year Outlook
Earnings Per Share, Revenue and Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The Company is re-confirming its previous full-year diluted earnings per share guidance of between $2.25 and $2.29 on a GAAP basis. This range of EPS represents between 20 and 22 percent growth, compared to $1.87 reported on a GAAP basis for 2002.
This EPS guidance includes the dilutive impact of the Hoover's acquisition, and certain other non-core gains and charges totaling 24 cents per share.
Before non-core gains and charges, D&B continues to expect full-year diluted earnings per share to be between $2.50 and $2.54, representing between 16 and 18 percent growth, compared to $2.15 of diluted earnings per share before a restructuring charge of 28 cents per share in 2002.
The Company expects net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 to be at the mid to low end of the previously announced range of $232 million and $272 million. As the Company delivers more of its product over the web, investment projects are becoming less capital intensive. This has caused a shift in cash outflow from net cash provided/(used in) investing activities to net cash provided by operating activities. This expected range is before any payments in settlement of tax or legal matters described in D&B's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because D&B is unable to predict the amount or timing of any such future payments, the Company is unable to provide an outlook for 2003 net cash provided by operating activities on a GAAP basis. Net cash provided by operating activities was $213.1 million in 2002.
D&B believes full-year core revenue growth will be in the mid to high end of the previously announced range of 1 to 4 percent before the effects of foreign exchange. Because D&B is unable to predict the future movements of foreign exchange rates the Company is unable to provide an outlook for 2003 revenue on a GAAP basis.
The Company also re-confirms that it will deliver more than 70 percent of its revenue over the Web by the end of the year, a goal that was reached in the second quarter.
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation and Amortization Update
As the Company delivers more of its product over the web, investment projects are becoming less capital intensive. This has caused a shift in spending from capital expenditures and capitalized software to operating expenses. As a result, the Company now expects:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
The section entitled "Full Year Outlook" of this press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of trends, risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements.
Demand for D&B's products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences and economic conditions which impact customer behavior. The Company's results are also dependent upon its continued ability to:
o       invest in its database and maintain its reputation for providing reliable data; o       develop and maintain a successful Web-based business model; o       develop new products; o       reallocate expense to achieve growth through its financial flexibility program; o       manage employee satisfaction and maintain its global expertise as it implements its financial flexibility program; and o      protect against damage or interruptions affecting its database or its data centers.
The Company is also subject to the effects of foreign economies, exchange rate fluctuations and U.S. and foreign legislative or regulatory requirements. Its results are also dependent upon the availability of data from its database. In addition, the Company's ability to repurchase shares is subject to market conditions, including trading volume in the Company's stock. Developments in any of these areas could cause results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected.
In addition, the Company's projection for net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 is dependant upon, among other things, the Company's ability to generate revenue, the Company's collection processes, customer payment patterns and the amount and timing of payments related to tax matters and legal proceedings involving the Company as more fully described in the Company's filings with the SEC.
For a more detailed discussion of the trends, risks and uncertainties that may affect D&B's operating and financial results and its ability to achieve the financial objectives discussed in this press release, readers should review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, including the section entitled "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A")," and the subsection entitled "Trends, Risks and Uncertainties" in the MD&A. Copies of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K are available on its web site at www.dnb.com and on the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. D&B cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
