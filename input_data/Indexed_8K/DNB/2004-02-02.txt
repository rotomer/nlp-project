PRESS RELEASE
D&B Announces 2003 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results
Short Hills, NJ February 2, 2004 # D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information and technology solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2003. The Company also announced a new share repurchase program and its next series of financial flexibility initiatives.
"Our results for the fourth quarter and 2003 as a whole played out as we expected," said Allan Z. Loren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of D&B. "We met our commitments for revenue growth, EPS, and net cash provided by operating activities. We achieved revenue growth in both our North American and International segments and each of our customer solution sets contributed to our growth. When we laid out our Blueprint for Growth strategy three years ago, we also said that we wanted the majority of our revenue delivered over the Web. At the end of 2003 we reached 76 percent and our plans call for reaching 80 percent in 2004. I am proud of our team as we stepped up our leadership this year and we did what we said we would do."
 
PRESS RELEASE
Fourth Quarter 2003 Results
The Company reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, of 98 cents, up 17 percent from 84 cents in the prior year quarter.
Total revenue for the quarter was $404.4 million, a 14 percent (9 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) increase compared with the prior year quarter, with 3 percentage points of the increase due to the Company's recent acquisitions. The total revenue results reflect the following by product line:
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $121 million, up 13 percent from the year ago period, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange which contributed 6 percentage points of growth, and the increased revenue. Net income for the quarter was $73.5 million, up 14 percent from $64.3 million in the prior-year period. The Company did not record any non-core gains or charges in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $79.4 million. The Company repurchased a total of $30 million of its common stock during the quarter under its $100 million share repurchase program approved by its Board of Directors in October 2002, completing that program.

Total revenue, was $1,386.4 million, a 9 percent (4 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) increase over total revenue in the year ago period.
Revenue from the Company's recent acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percentage points to the core revenue increase, with 2 percentage points from Hoover's, acquired in the first quarter of 2003, and 2 percentage points from Data House, acquired in the third quarter of 2002 and the three Italian real estate information companies acquired in the second quarter of 2003, which are reported as part of the Risk Management Solutions revenue in the International segment.

PRESS RELEASE

For the full year 2003, North America's core and total revenue was $960.1 million, up 5 percent compared with $912.1 million in 2002. Operating income was $329.9 million, up 5 percent over last year.

This improvement in profitability was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange which contributed 28 percentage points of growth, as well as the increased revenue.
See Schedule 1 for results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Schedule 2 for results before non-core gains and charges, and Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of GAAP results to results before non-core gains and charges. See Schedule 4 for revenue by product line for each geographic segment and other supplemental information. Also see below for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures.
Financial Flexibility Initiatives
An integral component of the Company's Blueprint for Growth strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value. In 2004, the Company plans to create additional financial flexibility through cross functional re-engineering that is expected to generate $70 to $80 million of annualized savings. The Company anticipates that it will incur restructuring charges of approximately $30 to $35 million during 2004 related to these initiatives.
The Company's plans include the continued implementation of its European market leadership strategy and re-engineering and consolidating a variety of business processes. This includes streamlining its technology infrastructure and its data acquisition and delivery techniques, as well as optimizing its financial
 
PRESS RELEASE
processes. The Company plans to announce further details of its financial flexibility plans in April 2004.
"Our financially flexible business model is a cornerstone of our Blueprint for Growth strategy and essential to our success because it allows us to invest in initiatives necessary to grow our business and increase shareholder value. It is the engine that fuels our growth and as such, is one of our competitive advantages," Loren said.
New $200 Million One-Year Share Repurchase Program
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new one year share repurchase program of up to $200 million, which at current market prices represents approximately 6 percent of shares outstanding. This program is in addition to the Company's existing repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans. The repurchase program will be funded from cash on hand.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
The Company did not record any non-core gains and charges in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year 2003, the Company recorded non-core charges related to its fourth phase of financial flexibility and the previously announced monetization of real estate of $17.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively. The charges have been recorded within full year operating income as Corporate and other expense. Additionally, the Company recorded a $7 million non-core gain related to an insurance recovery within full year non-operating income (expense)-net.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are incurred as part of each phase of its financial flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because it does not consider these charges and other similar items to reflect its underlying business performance. See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
 
PRESS RELEASE
2004 Outlook
The Company expects 2004 diluted earnings per share to be between $2.76 and $2.87 on a GAAP basis. This range of EPS represents between 20 and 25 percent growth, compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.30 reported on a GAAP basis for 2003.
This EPS guidance includes a non-core gain of $.14 to $.15 from the sale of businesses in its International segment during the first quarter of 2004. The Company also anticipates that it will incur non-core charges of $.27 to $.32 during 2004 related to its next phase of financial flexibility.
Before non-core gains and charges, D&B expects 2004 diluted earnings per share to be between $2.94 and $2.99, representing between 16 and 18 percent growth, compared to $2.54 of diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges of 24 cents per share in 2003. This guidance includes the effect of the new share repurchase program.
D&B expects full-year core revenue growth will be in a range of 3 to 5 percent before the effect of foreign exchange. Because D&B is unable to predict the future movements of foreign exchange rates the Company is unable to provide an outlook for 2004 revenue on a GAAP basis.
Beginning with this press release, D&B began reporting and projecting the amount of that it generates. For 2004, the Company expects to generate free cash flow of $230 to $245 million. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which D&B defines as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software & other intangibles. See the section "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for a discussion of free cash flow. These expected ranges are before any potential payments in settlement of tax or legal matters described in D&B's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. Free cash flow was $205 million in 2003.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. As it has done throughout 2003, D&B reports core revenue, revenue
 
PRESS RELEASE
growth before the effects of foreign exchange, and operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges. Please see D&B's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003 under the section entitled "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Evaluate Performance" for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
As noted above, beginning with this press release the Company is reporting free cash flow. Free cash flow measures the Company's available cash flow for potential debt repayment, stock repurchases and additions to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company believes free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating our liquidity and the cash generated by our consolidated operating businesses. Free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure of cash flows from operating activities, and does not necessarily represent amounts available for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP.
Fourth-Quarter Teleconference
D&B will review its fourth-quarter financial results and 2004 outlook in a conference call with the investment community on Tuesday, February 3, 2004, at 10 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call and other related information, will be accessible on D&B's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
