Bonnier Business Information, based in Stockholm, Sweden, is a leading business information provider in Europe and its Hoppenstedt business is one of the leading sales and marketing solutions brands in Germany. Bonnier Business Information entered into a similar transaction with D&B for the Nordic markets in December 2003. The sale is part of a strategic relationship whereby Bonnier Business Information will operate the acquired businesses under the D&B brand name and distribute D&B-branded products and solutions in these Central European markets. In addition, D&B will receive access to Bonnier Business Information's Central
European business information databases for international use, benefiting in particular from its depth and breadth of sales and marketing solutions data. As part of this agreement, Bonnier Business Information intends to make targeted investments to enhance the depth and richness of the Central European database. D&B will provide technical support for the businesses purchased by Bonnier Business Information under a multi-year services agreement. These Central European operations generated $52 million in revenues in 2003. The operations have approximately 370 employees, almost all of whom will transfer to Bonnier Business Information after the relationship is established. "With this transaction, we will provide our customers with access to enhanced global data, thus improving our customer value proposition and reinforcing the strength of the D&B brand," said Allan Z. Loren, chairman and chief executive officer of D&B. "This expansion of our strategic relationship with Bonnier Business Information reflects our progress in delivering on our commitment to enhance D&B's competitive position and performance in Europe," Loren added. "As we've previously said, we will continue to use different approaches to improve our competitive position from market to market. In some markets we will invest to strengthen our position and in other markets, we will establish strategic relationships to enhance our global data quality and coverage and increase shareholder value through improved operating margins." The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close during May. D&B currently expects to recognize a non-core pre-tax gain of approximately $5 million in the second quarter. As a result, the Company has increased its GAAP earnings guidance. The Company currently expects its 2004 diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, to be between $2.81 to $2.92 per share, compared with the previous guidance of $2.76 to $2.87 per share. The proceeds and gain expected from this transaction may change based on the value of the net assets of the businesses being sold on the date of closing of the transaction. These businesses are marginally profitable, and therefore the sale will not have a material impact on non-GAAP earnings guidance, revenue growth or free cash flow. The Company continues to expect 2004 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be between $2.94 and $2.99 per share, revenue growth of 3% to 5% and free cash flow of $230 million to $245 million. ###

The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and assumptions concerning this transaction include the possibility that the closing conditions contained in the agreement will not be satisfied, or that the net proceeds we will receive, in connection with this transaction, or the pre-tax gain we will recognize, will vary based upon the value
of the net assets of the businesses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic on the closing date. Demand for D&B's products is subject to intense competition, changes in customer preferences, and to a lesser extent, economic conditions which impact customer behavior. The Company's results are also dependent upon its continued ability to: o reallocate expenses to invest for growth through its financial flexibility program; o invest in its database and maintain its reputation for providing reliable data; o execute on its plan to improve the business model of its International segment and thereby improve its global data quality while realizing improved financial performance in that segment; o stabilize the decline in the traditional Risk Management Solutions transactional usage; o manage employee satisfaction and maintain its global expertise as it implements its financial flexibility program; o protect against damage or interruptions affecting its database or its data centers; and o develop new products or enhance existing ones to meet customer needs. The Company is also subject to the effects of foreign economies, exchange rate fluctuations and U.S. and foreign legislative or regulatory requirements. Its results are also dependent upon the availability of data for its database. Developments in any of these areas could cause results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected.
