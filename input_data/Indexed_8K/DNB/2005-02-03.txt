Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation ("we," "D&B" or the "Company") is furnishing the information under this Item 2.02 and the earnings press release attached hereto insofar as they disclose historical information regarding our results of operations or financial condition for the fourth-quarter and year ended December 31, 2004.
     On February 3, 2005, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth-quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information provided pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. Except for the information provided pursuant to Item 2.05, the information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
     On January 31, 2005, the Board of Directors of D&B approved the Company's 2005 Financial Flexibility program. Since the launch of our Blueprint for Growth strategy in 2000, we have utilized a financially flexible business model to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value. As a part of each initiative, we have incurred a restructuring charge, which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs, asset write-offs, and/or costs to terminate lease obligations, and transition costs, which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, cost of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses.
     In 2005, the Company will continue to implement its flexible business model through the following actions:
We expect to complete all actions under the 2005 initiative by December 2005. On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $70 to $80 million of financial flexibility (approximately $50 million in 2005), before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending. To implement these initiatives, D&B expects to incur transition costs of approximately $20 to $22 million. In addition, the Company expects to incur non-core restructuring charges totaling approximately $30 to $35 million pre-tax, of which $28 to 33 million relate to severance and termination costs and $2 to $3 million relate to lease termination obligations and other exit costs, in 2005. Approximately $60 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures.

PRESS RELEASE
Financial Flexibility Initiatives
An integral component of the Company's Blueprint for Growth strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and create shareholder value through its process of continuous re-engineering. Additional information on the Company's financially flexible business model can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, under the section titled "Item 1. Business - Our Aspiration and Our Strategy - Create Financial Flexibility."
In 2005, the Company will continue to implement its flexible business model through the following:
On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $70 million to $80 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $50 million will be generated in 2005. To implement these initiatives, D&B expects to incur transition costs of approximately $20 million to $22 million. In addition, the Company expects to incur non-core charges totaling $30 million to $35 million pre-tax, primarily for severance and termination costs in 2005.
As a result of these re-engineering initiatives, the Company expects approximately 400 positions will be eliminated globally. The Company anticipates that some team members will transition out of the business, others will move into new roles within D&B and some impacted positions will be eliminated through the normal course of attrition.
D&B will provide professional and personal support through on-site outplacement services and severance and benefits packages. In addition, the Company will work closely with team members to explore any available opportunities to re-deploy team members into other areas within D&B.

PRESS RELEASE
"Financial flexibility continues to be an important contributor to the success of our Blueprint for Growth strategy. This process has enabled D&B to improve the performance of our business in terms of quality and cost, while providing funds to invest for growth," said Alesio.
New $400 Million Two Year Share Repurchase Program
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $400 million two-year share repurchase program. This program is in addition to the Company's existing repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans. The Company expects that the share repurchase program will be funded from cash on hand and executed evenly over the two-year period.
Update on Tax Matters
The Company has previously reported in its SEC filings that it has three pending tax matters. As part of its ongoing efforts to resolve these matters, the Company settled the matter referred to as "Utilization of Capital Losses - 1989-1990" in its third quarter 2004 Form 10-Q. In connection with the settlement, the Company incurred a one-time, non-core charge for taxes of $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. This charge reflects the Company's current expectation to make a payment of approximately $17 million in 2005 in connection with this settlement.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded net pre-tax, non-core gains of $2.3 million and a non-core charge for taxes of $4.5 million (referenced above). The non-core charges in the fourth quarter of 2004 included a pre-tax, non-core charge of $11.1 million related to financial flexibility initiatives, recorded within operating income as Corporate and Other Expense. Additionally, the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-core gain of $13.4 million within Non-Operating Income (Expense)-Net, related to the sale of the Company's operations in Iberia and France. There were no non-core gains or charges in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Page 10 of 15
 
PRESS RELEASE
For the full year, the Company recorded net pre-tax, non-core charges of $1.7 million and $24.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the non-core charge for taxes of $4.5 million (referenced above). The non-core gains and charges for the full year of 2004 included a pre-tax, non-core charge of $32.0 million related to financial flexibility initiatives, recorded within operating income as Corporate and Other Expense. The Company also recorded pre-tax, non-core gains of $30.3 million, recorded as Non-Operating Income (Expense)-Net, related to the sale of D&B's operations in the Nordic region, India, Central Europe, Iberia and France.
The non-core gains and charges for the full year of 2003 included a pre-tax, non-core charge of $17.4 million related to financial flexibility initiatives and $13.8 million related to the monetization of real estate, and were recorded within operating income as Corporate and Other Expense. Additionally, the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-core gain of $7.0 million within Non-Operating Income (Expense)-Net, the result of an insurance recovery related to the events of September 11, 2001.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its financial flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures", below.
Full Year 2005 Outlook
The Company provided the following guidance for 2005, which includes the impact of expensing stock options:
Page 11 of 15
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B will expense stock options beginning in the third quarter of 2005. The annualized expense for stock options in 2005 is expected to be approximately $16 million and therefore, the Company will record an expense of approximately $8 million in the second half of 2005, or approximately $0.07 per share, related to the expensing of stock options. This $0.07 per share is included in the guidance outlined above.
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges, which are a component of these measures on a GAAP basis. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the Schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes ) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See the Company's Form 8-K filed July 19, 2004 with the SEC for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
