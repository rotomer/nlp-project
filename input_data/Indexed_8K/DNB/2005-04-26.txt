international businesses that had revenue of $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2004.
for the quarter was $82.4 million, up 9 percent from the year-ago period, before non-core gains and charges in both years. Strong growth in the U.S. was partially offset by a decline in operating income in the International segment. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $72.0 million, up 10 percent from the year-ago period.
Operating income
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
before non-core gains and charges was $50.2 million for the quarter, up 11 percent from $45.1 million in the prior year period. On a GAAP basis, net income was $52.1 million, up 5 percent compared with $49.8 million in the prior year period.

in the first quarter, excluding the impact of a $15.8 million legacy tax payment made during the quarter, was $78.1 million, up 18 percent from the prior year period. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles.

PRESS RELEASE
First Quarter 2005 Segment Results
As outlined in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ending December 31, 2004, which was filed with the SEC on March 14, 2005, D&B began reporting the results of its business in Canada as part of its International Segment in the first quarter of 2005. Prior to 2005, the Canadian results were reported as part of the North America segment. The Company will now report results under the following two segments: United States (U.S.) and International.
All references to 2004 financial results in this release have been adjusted to reflect this change.
See attached schedule 7 for 2004 revenue and operating income results of the U.S. and International segments adjusted to reflect this change.
United States
for the quarter was $263.2 million, up 9 percent from $242.2 million in the prior year period, all of which was organic.
Total and core revenue
U.S. total and core revenue results for the 2005 first quarter reflected the following by customer solution set:
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $98.1 million, up 15 percent from the prior year quarter. Improvement in revenue in the U.S. segment and the benefits of the Company's financial flexibility program contributed to the increase.
Operating income

PRESS RELEASE
International
for the quarter was $78.1 million, up 11 percent (up 5 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) from $70.6 million in the prior year quarter.
Core Revenue
International's core revenue results for the first quarter of 2005 reflected the following by customer solution set:
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $78.1 million, down 23 percent (down 27 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) compared with the prior year quarter revenue of $101.2 million. This decline was due to the impact of the divested international businesses that had revenue of $30.6 million in the first quarter of 2004.
Total revenue
See attached Schedule 6 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $1.9 million, as compared to $9.3 million, in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to the lower than expected revenue in the U.K., loss of operating income associated with the divested international businesses, and changes in Italian legislation that affected the Company's real estate information business in Italy.

PRESS RELEASE
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded net pre-tax, non-core charges of $10.4 million related to both the 2005 and 2004 financial flexibility initiatives and a non-core gain for taxes of $9 million related to tax benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant international entities whose assets were divested as part of the Company's International strategy. The Company recorded net pre-tax, non-core charges related to 2004 financial flexibility initiatives in the first quarter of 2004 of $10.2 million.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its financial flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures", below.
Confirms 2005 Outlook
The Company confirmed the following full year guidance for 2005, which includes the expensing of stock options:
Page 6
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B expects to expense stock options beginning in the third quarter of 2005. The annualized expense for stock options in 2005 is expected to be approximately $16 million, and therefore the Company expects to record an expense of approximately $8 million in the second half of 2005, or approximately $0.07 per share related to the expensing of stock options. This $0.07 per share is included in the guidance outlined above.
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the Schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes ) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 1. Business  How We Evaluate our Performance" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2004, filed March 14, 2005 with the SEC for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are also defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.
