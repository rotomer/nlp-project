"In the second quarter, D&B once again delivered strong growth in revenue, operating income and EPS, while continuing to invest in our brand and customer value proposition," said Steve Alesio, chairman, chief executive officer and president of D&B. "Our U.S. business, which accounts for the majority of our revenue, once again reported strong organic revenue growth and profitability. Additionally, during the quarter we made progress addressing the challenges in our International business. With our proven track record of growth, and our plans to continue to invest in our business, we are confident our success is sustainable."

for the quarter was $83.5 million, up 15 percent from the year-ago period, before non-core gains and charges in both years. Strong growth in the U.S. was partially offset by a decline in operating income in the International segment.

During the quarter, the Company also incurred transition costs of $8.1 million as compared to $6.0 million in the prior year quarter.

Second Quarter 2005 Segment Results
As outlined in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 14, 2005, D&B began reporting the results of its business in Canada as part of its International segment in the first quarter of 2005. Prior to 2005, the Canadian results were reported as part of the North America segment.
All references to 2005 financial results in this release have been adjusted to reflect this change.
See attached Schedule 7 for 2004 revenue and operating income results of the U.S. and International segments adjusted to reflect this change.
United States
for the quarter was $253.7 million, up 7 percent from $236.1 million in the prior year period.
Total and core revenue
U.S. total and core revenue results for the 2005 second quarter reflect the following by customer solution set:

PRESS RELEASE
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $82.3 million, up 17 percent from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to improved revenue in the U.S. segment and benefits from the Company's Financial Flexibility program.
Operating income
International
for the quarter was $98.0 million, up 15 percent (up 10 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) from $85.0 million in the prior year quarter. During the second quarter, International core revenue was positively impacted by the price increase in the Company's Italian real estate data business. This was outlined in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2005, filed with the SEC on May 5, 2005. The Italian real estate data business contributed 9 percentage points of growth driven by the acquisition of RIBES S.p.A. and the price increases.
Core revenue
International core revenue results for the second quarter of 2005 reflect the following by customer solution set:
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $98.0 million, down 14 percent (down 18 percent before the effect of foreign exchange) compared with the prior year quarter revenue of $113.8 million. This decline was due to the impact of the

See attached Schedule 6 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $21.3 million, down $1.7 million or 8 percent, before non-core gains and charges, as compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to lower operating income in the UK as a result of lower revenue and the loss of income from the Company's divested businesses, partially offset by strength in other international markets and savings from the Company's Financial Flexibility program. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $20.5 million, down $2.5 million or 11 percent.

Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded net pre-tax, non-core charges of $6.5 million related to both the 2005 and 2004 Financial Flexibility initiatives and charges totaling $1.9 million related to a dispute on the sale of the Company's French business. These charges were partially offset by pre-tax, non-core gains of $3.5 million related to the sale of a 5 percent investment in a South African company and $0.8 million related to lower than expected costs related to the sale of the Company's Iberian business.
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-core charge of $8.0 million related to 2004 Financial Flexibility initiatives and a non-core impairment charge of approximately $1.2 million to write down the net assets of the Company's Iberian business to its fair market value based on expected proceeds in connection with the anticipated sale of these operations. These charges were partially offset by a pre-tax, non-core gain of $5.6 million related to the sale of the Company's operations in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

PRESS RELEASE
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Acquisition of LiveCapital
The Company announced today that it has acquired LiveCapital located in San Mateo, California for $16 million, funded with cash on hand. LiveCapital is a provider of online credit management software that enables users to manage the entire credit process within an enterprise-wide system. D&B expects the acquisition will be approximately $0.03 per share dilutive in 2005 and accretive in 2006
,
.
"LiveCapital's credit management software will complement our existing Risk Management capabilities, providing our customers with an enhanced credit management experience," said Alesio. "Our acquisition of LiveCapital is part of our ongoing effort to improve the way our customers access and leverage DUNSRight so they can make confident business decisions," concluded Alesio.
Stock Option Expensing
The Company has decided to delay the expensing of stock options until January 2006 due to the uncertainty regarding the final implementation guidelines. The Company previously estimated that the expensing of stock options would have reduced earnings by $0.07 per share in the second half of 2005.

PRESS RELEASE
2005 Outlook
The Company revised its 2005 EPS and operating income guidance primarily due to the two partially off-setting factors described above: the acquisition of LiveCapital and the deferral of stock option expensing, as well as the Company's plans to continue to invest during the second half of the year.
The Company's 2005 guidance is now as follows:
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future

PRESS RELEASE
impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes ) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 1. Business  How We Evaluate our Performance" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2004, filed March 14, 2005 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.

D&B will review its second quarter 2005 financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Thursday, July 28, 2005, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.
