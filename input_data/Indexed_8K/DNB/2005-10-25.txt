PRESS RELEASE
for the quarter was $12.7 million, down $0.8 million or 6 percent, before non-core gains and charges, as compared to $13.5 million in the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily due to lower operating income in the UK as a result of lower revenue, increased legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of allegations made regarding disputes on the sale of the Company's French business, and the loss of income from the Company's divested businesses. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $13.1 million, down $0.4 million or 4 percent.

D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
2005 Outlook
The Company confirmed the following full year guidance:
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes ) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 1. Business  How We Evaluate our Performance" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2004, filed March 14, 2005 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
