Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On February 2, 2006, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information provided pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On January 31, 2006, our Board of Directors approved our 2006 Financial Flexibility Program. Since the launch of our Blueprint for Growth strategy in 2000, we have utilized a financially flexible business model to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value. As a part of each program, we have incurred a restructuring charge, which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs, asset write-offs, and/or costs to terminate lease obligations, and transition costs, which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, cost of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses.
In 2006, we will create financial flexibility through initiatives including the following:
We expect to complete all actions under the 2006 program by December 2006. On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $70 million to $75 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $50 million to $55 million will be generated in 2006, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of spending. To implement these initiatives, we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $15 million. In addition, we expect to incur non-core charges totaling $23 million to $28 million pre-tax, of which $10 million to $14 million relate to severance, approximately $9 million to $10 million relates to lease termination obligations and approximately $4 million relate to other exit costs in 2006. Approximately $36 million to $41 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. In addition, as a result of this re-engineering program, we expect that approximately 125 to 150 positions will be eliminated globally.

Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $9.1 million related to both the 2004 and 2005 Financial Flexibility initiatives. The Company also recorded a net non-core gain for taxes of $8.0 million, which included a $7.3 million gain related to tax benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant international entities whose assets were divested as part of the Company's international strategy, a $0.9 million refund related to the Company's legacy tax matter referred to as "Utilization of Capital Losses 1989-1990" in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2005, and a charge of $0.2 million related to the Company's repatriation of foreign cash.
For the full year, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $30.5 million and a net non-core gain for taxes of $1.6 million.
The net pre-tax, non-core charge for 2005 included a charge of $30.7 million related to both the 2004 and 2005 Financial Flexibility initiatives and charges totaling $4.1 million related to final resolution of all disputes on the sale of the Company's French business, as described more fully in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2005. These charges were partially offset by gains of $3.5 million related to the sale of a 5 percent investment in a South African company and $0.8 million related to lower than expected costs related to the sale of the Company's Iberian business.
The net non-core gain for taxes for the full year of 2005 included a gain of $16.3 million related to tax benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant international entities whose assets were divested as part of the Company's international strategy, a $9.3 million tax charge related to the Company's repatriation of foreign cash, a $6.3 million charge resulting from an increase in the tax legacy reserve for the matter referred to as "Royalty Expense Deductions 1993-1997" in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and a $0.9 million refund related to the Company's legacy tax matter referred to as "Utilization of Capital Losses 1989-1990" in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core gain of $2.3 million and a non-core charge for taxes of $4.5 million related to the settlement of the tax matter referred to as "Utilization of Capital Losses 1989-
Page 9 of 14
 
1990." The net pre-tax non-core gain in the fourth quarter of 2004 included a charge of $11.1 million related to financial flexibility initiatives and a gain of $13.4 million related to the sale of the Company's operations in Iberia and France.
For the full year 2004, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $1.7 million and a non-core charge for taxes of $4.5 million (referenced above). The net pre-tax non-core charge for the full year of 2004 included a charge of $32.0 million related to financial flexibility initiatives, partially offset by a gain of $30.3 million related to the sale of D&B's operations in the Nordic region, India and distribution channels in Pakistan and the Middle East, Central Europe, Iberia and France.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2006 Outlook
The Company provided the following full year 2006 guidance, which includes the impact of expensing stock options:
Page 10 of 14
 
D&B will expense stock options beginning in 2006. The annualized expense for stock options in 2006 is expected to be approximately $14 million, or $0.14 per share. This $0.14 per share is included in the guidance outlined above.
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 1. Business  How We Evaluate our Performance" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2004, filed March 14, 2005 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.
