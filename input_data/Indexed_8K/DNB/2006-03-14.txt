Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On March 14, 2006 The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (the "Company") closed its sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "Notes"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated March 9, 2006, among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase Securities LLC. The Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $297,423,000, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company will use the aggregate net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay in full the principal amount of $300 million of its 6.625% Senior Notes due March 15, 2006. The Notes are the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with all of its current and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under its senior credit facilities, and senior to all of its future subordinated debt. The Indenture (defined below) does not prohibit the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries.
     The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of March 14, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2011. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2006. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the notes on the immediately preceding March 1 and September 1, respectively.
     The foregoing description of the terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture entered into in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

Agreements
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (1) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (2) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (3) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice that would prevent its use or the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (4) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

registration statement and using its commercially reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.

     (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of such documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate or (c) result in a breach of, a default under or the acceleration of (or entitle any party to accelerate) the maturity of any obligation of the Company under, or result in or require, the creation of any lien upon or
 
security interest in any property of the Company pursuant to the terms of certain identified agreements or documents of the Company;
     (iv) no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any United States federal or New York governmental authority or regulatory body, or any governmental authority or regulatory body governing the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of any of this Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities to which it is a party, except as have been obtained and are in full force and effect under the Securities Act or the Trust Indenture Act, in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities, except for the authorizations, approvals, actions, notices and filings specified in this Agreement, each of which has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and, to our knowledge, has not been withdrawn;
     (v) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company;
     (vi) the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
     (vii) the Securities have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered and paid for as provided in this Agreement, the Securities will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
     (viii) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

     In addition, the Company shall have requested and caused Sherman & Sterling LLP to have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:
     (i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that on the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion); and
     (ii) such counsel has no reason to believe that the documents specified in a schedule to such counsel's letter, consisting of those included in the Disclosure Package and the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, when taken together as a whole, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In rendering such opinion and letter, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion and letter, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
          In addition, the Representatives shall have received from David J. Lewinter, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, an opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
     (iii) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the law of the State of Delaware;
     (iv) all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
     (v) the Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
     (vi) such counsel does not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries that would be required to be disclosed in Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and is not so disclosed, and such counsel does not know of any documents that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed or of any documents that are required to be summarized in the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus and are not so summarized.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom he believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (c) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
     (c) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chief Financial Officer and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any supplements or amendments thereto and this Agreement and that:
 
     (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
     (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice that would prevent its use or the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no change or development that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
     (e) The Company shall have requested and caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent registered public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100.

     (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized
 
statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
     (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
               If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
               The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, at 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, on the Closing Date.
               7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
               8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
provided
however
 
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereto. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the
provided
however
 
Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
               9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

               10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
               11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8

Successors
               14. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No fiduciary duty

     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture (and subject to delivery of the Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture as set forth in Section 203 with respect to the initial issuance of Securities of any series), the Company may deliver Securities of any series together with any coupons appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities; , , that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, (a) such Company Order may be delivered by the Company to the Trustee prior to the delivery to the Trustee of such Securities for authentication and delivery, (b) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue from time to time, in an aggregate Principal Amount not exceeding the aggregate Principal Amount established for such series, pursuant to a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order, (c) the rate or rates of interest, if any, the Stated Maturity or Maturities, the original issue date or dates, the redemption provisions, if any, and any other terms of Securities of such series shall be determined by a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures and (d) if provided for in such procedures, such Company Order may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company, or the Company's duly authorized agent or agents designated in an Officers' Certificate, which oral instructions shall be promptly confirmed in writing. The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
provided
however
 
               If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series and any related coupons have been established in or pursuant to one or more Officers' Certificates as permitted by Sections 201 and 203(a) or in a supplemental indenture, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 701) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
     (a) that the form and terms of such Securities and any coupons have been duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
     (b) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or its authenticating agent and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to customary exceptions; and
     (c) that all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of such Securities have been complied with, , , that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series (, that such Opinion of Counsel covers all Securities of such series) and that the Opinion of Counsel above shall state:
provided
however
provided
     (x) that the forms of such Securities have been, and the terms of such Securities (when established in accordance with such procedures as may be specified from time to time in a Company Order, all as contemplated by and in accordance with an Officers' Certificate pursuant to Section 203(a), as the case may be) will have been, duly authorized by the Company and established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
     (y) that such Securities, together with the coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, when (1) executed by the Company, (2) completed, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture, and (3) issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to customary exceptions.
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 203(a) and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series unless and until it has received written notification that such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume, unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary, that the Company's instructions to authenticate and deliver such
 
Securities do not violate any rules, regulations or orders of any governmental agency or commission having jurisdiction over the Company.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 203(a) and of the preceding three paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are subject to a Periodic Offering, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 203(a) at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such Officers' Certificate is delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
     Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.
     No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the following form:
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 212 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1204 or 1205 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
SECTION 205. .
Registrar and Paying Agent
     The Company shall maintain, with respect to each series of Securities, an office or agency where such Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where such Securities may be presented for purchase or payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their
 
transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term Paying Agent includes any additional paying agent.
     The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with respect to each series of Securities with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar (if not the Trustee). The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent for a particular series of Securities, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 707. The Company or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.
     The Company initially appoints the Trustee as the Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with such Securities and the Trustee, acting through its Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York.
SECTION 206. .
Paying Agent to Hold Money and Securities in Trust
     Except as otherwise provided herein, prior to or by 11:00 a.m. New York Time on each due date of payments in respect of any series of Securities, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent with respect to such Securities a sum of money sufficient to make such payments when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the making of payments in respect of the Securities of such series and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. At any time during the continuance of any such default, a Paying Agent shall, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all money so held in trust with respect to such Securities. If the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them acts as Paying Agent for a series of Securities, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent with respect to such Securities and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent for a series of Securities to pay all money held by it with respect to such Securities to the Trustee and to account for any money disbursed by it. Upon doing so, such Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money.
SECTION 207. .
Securityholder Lists
     The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders of each series of Securities. If the Trustee is not the Registrar for any series of Securities, the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Trustee at least semiannually on June 1 and December 1 a listing of Holders of such series of Securities dated within 15 days of the date on which the list is furnished and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders of such series of Securities.
SECTION 208. .
Transfer and Exchange
 
     (a) Generally, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 405 for such purpose in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations of a like aggregate Principal Amount and tenor. The Company shall not charge a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with the transfer or exchange of the Securities from the Securityholder requesting such transfer or exchange (other than any exchange of a temporary Security for a permanent Security not involving any change in ownership or any exchange pursuant to Section 211, 306, 905 or 1003, not involving any transfer).
     Notwithstanding any other provisions (other than the provisions set forth in the sixth and seventh paragraphs) of this Section, a Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like aggregate Principal Amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee or a duly appointed authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Security or Securities in global form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form in accordance with the instructions, if any, of the Depositary.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more global Securities shall no longer be represented by such global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Security or Securities in global
 
form representing such series in exchange for such Security or Securities in global form in accordance with the instructions, if any, of the Depositary.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified in the preceding two paragraphs or as contemplated by Section 203(a), any global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. If the beneficial owners of interests in a global Security are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Securities of such series and of like Principal Amount and tenor but of another authorized form and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 203(a), then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of such global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such global Security shall be surrendered by the Depositary with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such global Security, an equal aggregate Principal Amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such global Security to be exchanged which, as specified as contemplated by Section 203(a), shall be in the form of Registered Securities; , , that notwithstanding the last paragraph of this Section 208, no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the person to whom interest in respect of such portion of such global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
provided
however
     Upon the exchange of a Security in global form for Securities in definitive form, such Security in global form shall be cancelled by the Trustee. All cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures unless the Company directs, by Company Order, that the Trustee shall cancel Securities and return them to the Company. Registered Securities issued in exchange for a Security in global form pursuant to this Section 208 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Registered Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
     Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending (except as otherwise provided in the first proviso in the eighth paragraph of this Section 208) at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
SECTION 209. .
Replacement Securities and Coupons
     If (a) any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining thereto is surrendered to the Trustee or paying agent outside the United States, or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of written notice to the Company, any such paying agent or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or coupon or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon, or in exchange for the Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and Principal Amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon, or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security or coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security or coupon) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and in the case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and such Trustee and any agent of any of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof.
     Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
     Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new Security and coupons, if any, shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that issue and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.
SECTION 210. .
Outstanding Securities; Determinations of Holders' Action
     Securities of any series "Outstanding" at any time are, as of the date of determination, all the Securities of such series theretofore authenticated by the Trustee for such series except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 210 as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be "Outstanding" because the Company or an Affiliate thereof holds the Security; , , that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite Principal Amount of Outstanding Securities have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or such other obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only Securities which a Trust Officer actually knows to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor. Subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time of such determination shall be considered in any such determination (including, without limitation, determinations pursuant to Articles 6 and 9). In addition, in determining whether the Holders of the requisite Principal Amount of Outstanding Securities have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, (i) the Principal Amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the Principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 602 and (ii) the Principal Amount of a Security denominated in a foreign currency or currencies shall be the Dollar equivalent, as determined on the date of original issuance of such Security, of the Principal Amount (or, in the case of a Discount Security, the Dollar equivalent on the date of original issuance of such Security of the amount determined as provided in (i) above) of such Security.
provided
however
     If a Security has been paid pursuant to Section 209 or in exchange for or in lieu of which another Security has been authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture, it ceases to be Outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
 
     If the Trustee (other than the Company) holds, in accordance with this Indenture, on a Redemption Date or on Stated Maturity, money sufficient to pay Securities and any coupons thereto appertaining payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities shall cease to be Outstanding and interest, if any, on such Securities shall cease to accrue; , that if such Securities are to be redeemed, notice of such redemption has been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee has been made.
provided
SECTION 211. .
Temporary Securities
     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the permanent Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Such temporary Securities may be in global form.
     If temporary Securities for some or all of the Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause permanent Securities representing such Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. Subject to Section 202, after the preparation of such permanent Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for such permanent Securities of like tenor upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 405 in a Place of Payment for such series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like Principal Amount of permanent Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as permanent Securities.
SECTION 212. .
Cancellation
     All Securities or coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any sinking fund payment, shall, if surrendered to any person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and all Registered Securities and matured coupons so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever (including Securities received by the Company in exchange or payment for other Securities of the Company) and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may not reissue, or issue new Securities to replace, Securities it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted in the form of Securities for
 
any particular series or as permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities and coupons shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary procedures.
SECTION 213. .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
     Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 203(a) with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities at his address as it appears in the register of the Securities, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 208, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
SECTION 214. .
Persons Deemed Owners
     Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of Principal of and interest on such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
SECTION 215. .
Computation of Interest
     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 203(a), interest on any Securities which bear interest at a fixed rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Selection of Securities to be Redeemed
          Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 203(a) with respect to any series of Securities, if less than all the Securities of any series with the same issue date, interest rate and Stated Maturity are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the particular Securities to be redeemed by such method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate, which method may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the Principal Amount of Registered Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series.

SECTION 304. .
Effect of Notice of Redemption
          Once notice of redemption is given, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price stated in the notice, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; , , that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 203(a), installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Sections 208 and 213.

          If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the Principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
SECTION 305. .
Deposit of Redemption Price
          Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York Time on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit in the Place of Payment with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date)
 
accrued interest on, all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption which prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. If such money is then held by the Company in trust and is not required for such purpose, it shall be discharged from such trust.
SECTION 306. .
Securities Redeemed in Part
          Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and upon such surrender, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, in an authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, equal in aggregate Principal Amount to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the Principal of the Security surrendered.
SECTION 401. .
Payment of Securities
          The Company shall promptly make all payments in respect of each series of Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and, to the extent not otherwise so provided, pursuant to this Indenture. An installment of Principal of or interest on the Securities shall be considered paid on the date it is due if the Trustee or a Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds by 10:00 a.m. on that date funds (in the currency or currencies of payment with respect to such Securities) designated for and sufficient to pay such installment.
SECTION 402. .
SEC Reports
          The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the SEC, copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a).
          Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
SECTION 403. .
Compliance Certificate
          The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2006) an officers' certificate signed by one of the principal executive officer, principal accounting officer, principal financial officer or treasurer of the Company stating whether or not the signer knows of any Default that occurred during such period. If they do, such officers' certificate shall describe the Default and its status.
SECTION 404. .
Further Instruments and Acts

SECTION 405. .
Maintenance of Office or Agency
          If Securities of a series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for such series an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in New York, New York, shall be such office or agency for all of the aforesaid purposes unless the Company shall maintain some other office or agency for such purposes and shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such other office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 1202.
          The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; , , that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
provided

SECTION 406. .
Additional Amounts
          If specified as contemplated by Section 203(a), the Securities of a series may provide for the payment of additional amounts, and in such case, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series or any coupon appertaining thereto additional amounts as provided therein. Wherever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the Principal of or any interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or payment of any related coupon, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional amounts provided for in this Section to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are,
 
were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section and express mention of the payment of additional amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.
          If the Securities of a series provide for the payment of additional amounts, at least 10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which payment of Principal is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of Principal and any interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the Trustee and the Company's Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of Principal of and any interest on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities of that series or any related coupons who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of that series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities or coupons and the Company will pay to the Trustee or such Paying Agent the additional amounts required by the Securities of such series and this Section. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section.
SECTION 407. .
Liens
          The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume, or permit to exist any lien on any property or asset to secure any indebtedness of the Company, any Subsidiary or any other person, or permit any Subsidiary to do so, without making effective provision whereby the Securities then outstanding shall be secured by the lien equally and ratably with such indebtedness for so long as such indebtedness shall be so secured, subject to the following exceptions:
     (a) Permitted Encumbrances;
     (b) liens existing on the date of this Indenture;
     (c) liens on assets or property of a corporation at the time it becomes a Subsidiary securing only indebtedness of such corporation, such indebtedness was not incurred in connection with such corporation becoming a Subsidiary;
provided
     (d) liens existing on assets created at the time of the acquisition, purchase, lease, improvement or development of such assets to secure all or a portion of the purchase price or lease for, or the costs of improvement or development of, such assets;
     (e) liens to secure any extension, renewal, refinancing or refunding (or successive extensions, renewals, refinancings or refundings), in whole or in part, of any indebtedness
 
secured by liens referred to in this Section 407 or liens created in connection with any amendment, consent or waiver relating to such indebtedness, so long as such lien does not extend to any other property, the amount of debt secured is not increased (other than by the amount equal to any costs and expenses incurred in connection with any extension, renewal, refinancing or refunding) and the indebtedness so secured does not exceed the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the assets subject to such liens at the time of such extension, renewal, refinancing or refunding, or such amendment, consent or waiver, as the case may be;
     (f) liens incurred in connection with the financing of accounts receivable of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries so long as (1) such lien extends only to the assets of the entity that received the proceeds of such financing, (2) the lien secures indebtedness not in excess of the proceeds received, and (3) the aggregate indebtedness secured does not, at any time, exceed $200,000,000.
     (g) liens on property incurred in a Permitted Sale and Leaseback Transaction;
     (h) liens in favor of only the Company or one or more Subsidiaries granted by the Company or a Subsidiary to secure any obligations owed to the Company or a Subsidiary;
     (i) liens arising out of a judgment, decree or order of court being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, that adequate reserves with respect thereto are maintained on the books of the Company or the books of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in conformity with GAAP; and
provided
     (j) liens not permitted by clauses (a) through (i) of this Section 407, securing indebtedness which, together with the Sale and Leaseback Transactions subject to Section 408, do not at any time exceed the greater of (1) 10% of shareholders equity or (2) an aggregate amount of $450,000,000.
SECTION 408. .
Sale and Leasebacks
          The Company shall not enter into any Sale and Leaseback Transaction (other than a Permitted Sale and Leaseback Transaction), nor permit any Subsidiary to do so, unless the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled to secure the property to be leased in a principal amount equal to the Value of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction (without equally and ratably securing the outstanding Securities) because such liens would be of such character that no violation of any of the provisions of Section 407 would result.
 
SECTION 501. .
When Company May Merge or Transfer Assets
          The Company may not consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Company's property and assets substantially as an entirety to another entity unless:
     (a) either (1) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (2) the person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company are conveyed or transferred (i) shall be a U.S. corporation, partnership, limited liability company or trust organized and validity existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture;
     (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (a)(ii) above, no event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become a Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing;
     (c) if, as a result of any consolidation, merger, sale or lease, conveyance or transfer described in this Section 501, properties or assets of the Company would become subject to any lien which and would not be permitted by Section 407 without equally and ratably securing the Securities, the Company or such successor person, as the case may be, will take steps as are necessary to effectively secure the Securities equally and ratably with, or prior to, all indebtedness secured by those liens as provided in Section 407; and
     (d) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied. For purposes of the foregoing, the conveyance or transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise) of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries (other than to the Company or another wholly owned Subsidiary), which, if such assets were owned by the Company, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company, shall be deemed to be the conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
          The successor person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the successor person to which such conveyance or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the Company herein; and thereafter, except in the case of a lease of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture, the
 
Securities and coupons. The Trustee shall enter into a supplemental indenture to evidence the succession and substitution of such successor person and such discharge and release of the Company.
SECTION 601. .
Events of Default
          Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 203(a) with respect to any series of securities, an "Event of Default" occurs, with respect to each series of the Securities individually, if:
     (1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest upon any Security of such series when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
     (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal or any premium of any Security of such series when due by declaration, when called for redemption or otherwise;
     (3) the Company fails to perform or the Company breaches any covenant or warranty in the Securities or this Indenture and applicable to the Securities, continuing for 90 days after notice to the Company by the Trustee or by Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities;
     (4) there shall have been the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of (a) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or (b) a decree or order adjudging the Company bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the wind up or liquidation of its affairs, and any such decree or order for relief shall continue to be in effect, or any such other decree or order shall be unstayed and in effect, for a period of 90 consecutive days;
     (5) (a) the Company commences a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, (b) the Company consents to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, (c) the Company files a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or substantially comparable relief under any applicable federal or state law, (d) the Company (x) consents to the filing of such petition or the appointment of, or taking possession by, a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, (y) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (z) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due or (e) the Company takes any corporate action in furtherance of any such actions in this clause (4); and
 
     (6) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.
          "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
          A Default under clause (2) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (2) above after receipt of such notice. Any such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default."
SECTION 602. .
Acceleration
          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 601(3) or (4)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the Principal Amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Discount Securities, such portion of the Principal Amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all the Securities of that series to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such Principal (or portion thereof) shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 601(3) or (4) occurs and is continuing, the Principal (or portion thereof) of all the Securities of that series shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder) may rescind an acceleration with respect to that series and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and all existing Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the Principal (or portion thereof) of Securities of such series that has become due solely as a result of such acceleration and if all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 707 have been paid. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
SECTION 603. .
Other Remedies
          If an Event of Default with respect to a series of Outstanding Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to (a) collect the payment of the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for Principal and interest, with interest upon the overdue Principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments of interest from the date such interest was due, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including amounts due the Trustee under Section 707 or (b) enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
 
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or coupons or does not produce any of the Securities or coupons in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
SECTION 604. .
Waiver of Past Defaults
          The Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder), may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and any related coupons waive an existing Default with respect to such series and its consequences except (1) an Event of Default described in Section 601(1) with respect to such series or (2) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 902 cannot be amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
SECTION 605. .
Control by Majority
          The Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines in good faith is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
SECTION 606. .
Limitation on Suits
          A Holder of any Security of any series or any related coupons may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless:
     (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series is continuing;
     (2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
     (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
     (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
     (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request during such 60-day period.
 
          A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of any other Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over any other Securityholder. A Securityholder may not enforce this Indenture or the Securities except as herein provided.
SECTION 607. .
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of any Holder of any Security or coupon to receive payment of the Principal of and (subject to Section 213) interest on such Security or payment of such coupon on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities or any Redemption Date, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected adversely without the consent of each such Holder.
SECTION 608. .
Collection Suit by Trustee
          If an Event of Default described in Section 601(1) with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount owing with respect to such series of Securities and the amounts provided for in Section 707.
SECTION 609. .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
          In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the Principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue Principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
     (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of Principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amount due the Trustee under Section 707) and of the Holders of Securities and coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
     (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any Custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of Securities and coupons, to pay the Trustee any amount
 
due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 707.
          Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding.
SECTION 610. .
Priorities
          If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of Principal or interest, upon presentation of the Securities or coupons, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 707;
     SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid for the Principal and interest on the Securities and interest evidenced by coupons in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities and coupons for Principal and interest, respectively; and
     THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company.
          The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section 610. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.
SECTION 611. .
Undertaking for Costs
          In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 611 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 607 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security or coupon for the enforcement of the payment of the Principal of or interest on any Security or the payment of any coupon on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).
 
SECTION 612. .
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
          The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 701. .
Duties of Trustee
          (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his/her own affairs.
          (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series:
     (1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others; and
     (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, with respect to any certificates or opinions specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (1) this paragraph (c) does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section 701;
     (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

          This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: March 14, 2006
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 14, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000, subject to certain exceptions referred to in the Indenture. In addition, the Company may from time to time without the consent of the Holders of Securities create and issue further securities having the same terms and conditions as the Securities in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date and issue price) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding securities of this series (including the Securities) or upon such terms as the Company may determine at the time of their issue. References herein to the Securities include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other securities issued as described in this paragraph and forming a single series with the Securities.
          The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' notice by mail, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 15 basis points plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
          "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealers as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.
          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors unless any of them shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other two Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
          "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its
 
principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Treasury Reference Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
          "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date.
          In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
          This Security shall have the benefit of the covenants and agreements set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
          As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days
 
after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the security register, upon surrender of this Security for transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
          The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          No service charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
          Prior to due presentment of this Security for transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
          This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent acting on its behalf) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of the Security.
          This Security shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
          All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
