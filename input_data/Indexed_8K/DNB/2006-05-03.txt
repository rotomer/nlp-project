First Quarter 2006 Segment Results
United States
for the quarter was $286.0 million, up 9 percent from $263.2 million in the prior year quarter.
Core and total revenue
U.S. core and total revenue results for the first quarter of 2006 reflect the following:
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $103.7 million, up 6 percent from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to improved revenue in the U.S. segment and benefits from the Company's Financial Flexibility program, partially offset by higher benefit costs, including stock option expensing, and the impact of increased costs associated with data purchases from our International segment.
Operating income
 
International
for the quarter was $81.2 million, up 11 percent before the effect of foreign exchange (up 4 percent after the effect of foreign exchange from $78.1 million in the prior year quarter). During the first quarter, the Italian real estate data business contributed 3 percentage points of core revenue growth with the majority of the growth due to a price increase.
Core and total revenue
International core and total revenue results for the first quarter of 2006 reflect the following:
See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the quarter was $8.7 million, up $6.8 million from $1.9 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily due to improved revenue in the International segment, benefits from the Company's Financial Flexibility program and data sales to our U.S. segment, as referenced earlier.
Operating income
 
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $6.4 million related to its Financial Flexibility initiatives.
During the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-core charges of $10.4 million related to its Financial Flexibility initiatives and a non-core gain for taxes of $9.0 million related to tax benefits recognized upon the liquidation of dormant international entities whose assets were divested as part of the Company's International strategy.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
2006 Outlook
The Company confirmed the following full year guidance for 2006, which includes the expensing of stock options:
 
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue after the effects of foreign exchange and core revenue growth before and after the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, free cash flow, and net debt position.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2005, filed March 1, 2006 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
