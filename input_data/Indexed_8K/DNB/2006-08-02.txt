New $200 Million One-Year Share Repurchase Program; And New Four-Year Five Million Share Repurchase Program to Offset Dilution
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $200 million one-year share repurchase program. The new $200 million program is in addition to the Company's existing two-year $500 million program commenced in the first quarter of 2005. The new program will commence upon completion of the current $500 million program, which has $88.8 million remaining. The Company anticipates that the new $200 million program will be completed within twelve months after its initiation.
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new four-year five million share repurchase program to offset dilution. The three-year six million share repurchase program we currently have in place to offset dilution is set to expire in September, 2006.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $3.6 million related to its Financial Flexibility initiatives and a tax charge of $0.8 million related to the legacy tax item referred to as "Royalty Expense Deductions 1993-1997" in the company's SEC filings.
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-core charges of $6.5 million related to its Financial Flexibility initiatives and charges totaling $1.9 million related to a dispute on the sale of the Company's French business. These charges were partially offset by pre-tax, non-core gains of $3.5 million related to the sale of a 5 percent investment in a South African company
 
PRESS RELEASE
and $0.8 million related to lower than expected costs related to the sale of the Company's Iberian business.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
2006 Outlook
The Company raised its EPS guidance, lowered its tax guidance range, and confirmed guidance for all other metrics.
More specifically, the Company's full year guidance for 2006, which includes the expensing of stock options, is now:
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue after the effects of foreign exchange and core revenue growth before and after the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, free cash flow, and net debt position. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q , as filed with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.

N/M  Not Meaningful
The following defines the non-GAAP measures used to evaluate performance: *Total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses is referred to as "core revenue." Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. *Core revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, is referred to as "revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange." We also separately analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, "organic core revenue growth" and "core revenue growth from acquisitions." In addition, we analyze core revenue both before and after the financial results of our Italian real estate data business because of the distortion of comparability of financial results due to significant price increases implemented in 2005 in response to legislative changes and the uncertainty of other regulatory changes. *Results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) exclude Restructuring Charges (whether recurring or non-recurring) and certain other items that we consider not to reflect our underlying business performance. We refer to these Restructuring Charges and other items as "non-core gains and (charges)." * Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles is referred to as "free cash flow." * Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus short-term debt and long-term debt is referred to as "net debt position."
