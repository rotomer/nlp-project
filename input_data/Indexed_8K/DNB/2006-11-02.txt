D&B will be the majority shareholder in the new venture, which the Company expects will commence business in early December, subject to completion of certain regulatory and contractual conditions. Additional financial details are not being disclosed.
Huaxia D&B China is expected to significantly improve D&B's quality and coverage of commercial data in China and enhance the Company's competitive position in the Asia-Pacific market. The joint venture will leverage the parent companies' best-in-class data collection capabilities and the D&B Worldwide Network to deliver superior commercial insight and value to customers around the world. The new entity will distribute both D&B and co-branded products and solutions throughout China.

PRESS RELEASE
final resolution of all disputes on the sale of the Company's French business, as described more fully in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2005.
The non-core charges for taxes of $15.4 million in the third quarter of 2005 included a $9.1 million tax charge related to the Company's repatriation of foreign cash and a $6.3 million charge resulting from an increase in the tax legacy reserve for the matter referred to as "Royalty Expense Deductions 1993-1997" in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2005.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
2006 Outlook
The Company updated its full-year guidance for 2006, which includes the expensing of stock options, as follows:
 
PRESS RELEASE
D&B does not provide revenue growth guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, the Company does not provide EPS guidance, operating income growth, free cash flow or tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions. The impact of these non-core gains and charges could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue after the effects of foreign exchange and core revenue growth before and after the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, free cash flow, and net debt position.

N/M  Not Meaningful
The following defines the non-GAAP measures used to evaluate performance:
*Total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses is referred to as "core revenue." Core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition.
*Core revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, is referred to as "revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange." We also separately analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components, "organic core revenue growth" and "core revenue growth from acquisitions." In addition, we analyze core revenue both before and after the financial results of our Italian real estate data business because of the distortion of comparability of financial results due to significant price increases implemented in 2005 in response to legislative changes and the uncertainty of other regulatory changes.
*Results (such as operating income, operating income growth, operating margin, net income, tax rate and diluted earnings per share) exclude Restructuring Charges (whether recurring or non-recurring) and certain other items that we consider not to reflect our underlying business performance. We refer to these Restructuring Charges and other items as "non-core gains and (charges)."
* Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles is referred to as "free cash flow."
* Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus short-term debt and long-term debt is referred to as "net debt position."
