The purpose of this filing is to report to you actions taken by certain of our executive officers with respect to tax liabilities that they will incur in February 2007 in connection with the vesting of previously granted restricted stock awards.
 
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     In February 2007, restrictions on shares of our common stock previously awarded to certain of our executive officers are scheduled to lapse according to the schedule set forth below. On the applicable vesting date, each executive officer will realize taxable income equal to the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date, at which time we are required to withhold or receive from the executive related taxes at statutorily defined rates. In order to facilitate the withholding, each of the executive officers named below has made an irrevocable election prior to the date of this filing to satisfy the applicable withholding through the deduction of that number of shares from the vested amount having an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount required to be so withheld. The withholding of shares to satisfy withholding will be reported on a Form 4 within 2 business days of each vesting date.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
DATE: December 5, 2006
