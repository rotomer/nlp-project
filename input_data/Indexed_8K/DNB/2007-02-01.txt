Dividend Initiation
D&B today announced that its Board of Directors has declared the Company's first quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. This initial quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 29, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2007.
 
PRESS RELEASE
Full Year 2007 Outlook
The Company recently provided the following full year 2007 financial guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2005, filed March 1, 2006 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.
