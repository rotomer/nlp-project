The purpose of this filing is to report to you certain changes to the benefits that we provide to our U.S. team members under our Dun & Bradstreet Corporation Retirement Account and our 401(k) Plan.
 
Table of Contents

Such changes to the U.S. Qualified Plan and 401(k) Plan will not have an impact on our 2007 financial guidance.
On an annualized net basis, we believe that these actions will not have a material impact on our operating income and will result in a decrease to our cash flow from operating activities of approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million, primarily as a result of the increased match under the 401(k) Plan.
