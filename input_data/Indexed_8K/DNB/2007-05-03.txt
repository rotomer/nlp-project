D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Dividend Declared
D&B announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on June 15, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2007.
New $200 Million One-Year Share Repurchase Program
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $200 million one-year share repurchase program. The new program will commence after completion of the current $200 million program, which has $56.3 million remaining. The Company anticipates that the new $200 million program will be completed within 12 months after its initiation.
 
Full Year 2007 Outlook Confirmed
The Company confirmed the following full year guidance for 2007:
 
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic core revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow.
