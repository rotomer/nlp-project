Short Hills, NJ  August 6, 2007  D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information, tools and commercial insight, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.

"We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments for 2007, and we feel good about our prospects for the future as we maintain our focus on driving total shareholder return."

Non-Core Gains and Charges
As previously announced, during the second quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a net non-core gain of $31.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, due primarily to the resolution of our remaining legacy tax matter with the IRS for the tax years 1997-2002. In addition, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $4.9 million related to its financial flexibility initiatives and a net pre-tax, non-core gain of $0.8 million related to the sale of an investment in Australia.
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a net pre-tax, non-core charge of $3.6 million primarily related to its financial flexibility initiatives.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Dividend Declared
D&B announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on September 17, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2007.
Full Year 2007 Outlook Confirmed
The Company confirmed the following full year guidance for 2007:
 
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic core revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, filed February 28, 2007 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.
