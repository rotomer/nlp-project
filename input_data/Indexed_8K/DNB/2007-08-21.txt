Item 8.01 Other Events.
Tax Withholding Election
On September 5, 2007, restrictions on 1,000 shares of our common stock previously awarded to James M. Howland, our President, D&B International, are scheduled to lapse. On such date, Mr. Howland will realize taxable income equal to the fair market value of the shares, at which time we are required to withhold or receive from Mr. Howland related taxes at statutorily defined rates. In order to facilitate the tax withholding, Mr. Howland has made an irrevocable election prior to the date of this filing to satisfy the applicable tax withholding through the deduction of that number of shares from the vested amount having an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount required to be so withheld. The withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding will be reported on a Form 4.
