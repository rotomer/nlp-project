Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Initiatives to Drive Long-Term Growth
D&B today announced two initiatives which directly support the Company's long-term growth strategy:
Risk Management: Japanese Joint Venture Agreement
D&B has signed an agreement which expands its risk management business in Japan. Specifically, D&B is establishing a new joint venture with its existing Japanese partner Tokyo Shoko Research (TSR). D&B will be the majority shareholder in the joint venture, which will trade under the name Dun & Bradstreet TSR Ltd. This new joint venture will allow D&B to expand upon its existing business in Japan by extending the depth of its risk management offerings to large business customers and global multinationals. The joint venture will begin business operations in fiscal 2008, subject to the completion of customary closing requirements.

PRESS RELEASE
 
Commercial Data Integration: Acquisition of Purisma
D&B has acquired Purisma, Incorporated, a provider of commercial data integration (CDI) software solutions, for $48 million. The acquisition was closed in late October. Purisma provides software capabilities that will enable D&B to further penetrate the fast-growing CDI marketplace. Purisma provides a strong strategic fit with D&B as its data hub and CDI software appliance are built to leverage the D&B database, simplifying the integration of D&B data with customers' internal systems and further embedding D&B solutions behind the customer firewall.
Financial Impact of These Two Initiatives
D&B's acquisition of Purisma and creation of a joint venture in Japan will have a small impact on 2007 earnings, which is incorporated in the Company's guidance for the full year. For 2008, these transactions are expected to generate approximately 1.5 points of incremental revenue growth for D&B. The transactions are expected to be approximately $5 million dilutive to 2008 operating income and $0.10 dilutive to 2008 earnings, and accretive thereafter. On a cash basis, these transactions are expected to be approximately $0.05 dilutive to 2008 earnings.
D&B will provide additional detail on these initiatives on its third quarter 2007 earnings conference call, and the expected financial impact of these transactions is included in the Company's full year 2007 outlook and its preliminary 2008 outlook set forth below.
Full Year 2007 Outlook Confirmed
The Company confirmed the following full-year guidance for 2007:

PRESS RELEASE
 
 
 
Preliminary 2008 Outlook Announced
D&B has announced the following preliminary financial outlook for 2008, which includes the impact of the Company's acquisition of Purisma and creation of a joint venture in Japan:
 
 
 
The Company expects to update its full year 2008 outlook, including its outlook for 2008 free cash flow and tax rate, at year end.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports core revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic core revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per

share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, filed February 28, 2007 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this earnings release.
Dividend Declared
D&B announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on December 14, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2007.
