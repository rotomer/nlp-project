The purpose of this filing is to report to you that we have: (i) issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007; (ii) within the aforementioned press release, updated our 2008 financial guidance to reflect the sale of our Italian real estate data business; and (iii) taken certain actions with respect to our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program.
On January 30, 2008, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information provided pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
 
An integral component of our strategy is creating financial flexibility to fund investments for growth and to create shareholder value.
Through our Financial Flexibility Program we continually and systematically seek ways to improve our performance in terms of quality and cost. Specifically, we seek to eliminate, standardize, consolidate and automate our business functions. As a part of each program, we have incurred a restructuring charge, which generally consists of, among other things, employee severance and termination costs. We also have incurred transition costs, which generally consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees, cost of temporary workers, relocation costs and stay bonuses.
Our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program, which was approved on January 24, 2008, builds on efforts initiated in 2007 to reduce significantly the complexity of our business, a process that we anticipate continuing over the next several years. Specifically, in 2008, we will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
On an annualized basis, the actions under our 2008 Financial Flexibility Program are expected to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2008, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. We expect all actions under our 2008 program to be completed by December 2008. To implement these initiatives we expect to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million.
In addition, we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling $20 million to $25 million pre-tax, of which $18 million to $23 million relate to severance, approximately $1 million relate to lease termination obligations and approximately $1 million relate to other exit costs in 2008.
Approximately $30 million to $40 million of these transition costs and restructuring charges are expected to result in cash expenditures. As a result of this financial flexibility program we expect that approximately 300-350 positions will be eliminated globally.
 
We also disclosed in the above mentioned January 30, 2008 press release that we have updated our 2008 full-year financial guidance to reflect the sale of our Italian real estate data business. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 7.01 by reference.

PRESS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Short Hills, NJ  January 30, 2008 D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information, tools and commercial insight, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. The Company also announced its 2008 financial flexibility program, the sale of its Italian real estate business and updated 2008 financial guidance.
"We are pleased with our 2007 results, as we once again met our financial commitments and extended our track record of consistent performance over time," said Steve Alesio, D&B's Chairman and CEO. "We delivered a strong fourth quarter, and exit 2007 with good momentum. We feel good about our prospects for the future, and expect to deliver continued growth in 2008."
Sale of Italian Real Estate Business
On December 27, 2007, D&B completed the sale of its Italian real estate business which is now being accounted for as a discontinued operation. D&B sold this business for $9.0 million and received indemnification against certain potential data reuse fees. On a 2007 full-year basis, the Italian real estate business generated $60.5 million in revenue, $13.6 million in operating income, $5.4 million in net income and $0.09 of EPS. D&B will recognize a small non-core gain on the sale of this business in the first quarter of 2008.
The discussion of 2007 results in this press release includes the Italian real estate business, consistent with our 2007 guidance. GAAP results include non-core gains and charges and reflect the Italian real estate business as a discontinued operation.

Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded:
 
 
For the years ending 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedules 3 and 8 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
 
2008 Financial Flexibility Initiatives
In 2008, D&B will continue to address complexity reduction and create financial flexibility through several initiatives, including the following:
 
 
 
 
On an annualized basis, these actions are expected to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility, of which approximately $60 million to $65 million will be generated in 2008 before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. To implement these initiatives, the Company expects to incur transition costs of approximately $13 million to $15 million in 2008. In addition, the Company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $20 million to $25 million in 2008. As a result of this reengineering program, the company expects that approximately 300-350 positions will be eliminated globally.
For additional detail concerning D&B's 2008 Financial Flexibility Program, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 30, 2008.
Updated Full Year 2008 Outlook
D&B today provided updated full year financial guidance for 2008, which reflects the sale of the Company's Italian real estate business. See attached schedule 7 for 2007 financial results from continuing operations before non-core gains and charges, which are adjusted to reflect the sale of the Italian real estate business.
 
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. D&B reports revenue and core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange. Additionally, the Company reports organic revenue growth and each of operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share and tax rate (defined as Provision for Income Taxes divided by Income before Provision for Income Taxes) before non-core gains and charges, and free cash flow. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2006, filed February 28, 2007 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. These measures are defined in Schedules 3 and 8 attached to this earnings release. In addition, for 2007 and the comparable prior year periods, in order to ensure consistency and transparency with investors, the Company also reported financial results with and without the Italian real estate business which is now reflected as discontinued operations.
