Tax Withholding Election
On December 17, 2008, restrictions on 2,547 shares of our common stock previously awarded to Charles E. Gottdiener, our President, Global Solutions, are scheduled to lapse. On this date, Mr. Gottdiener will realize taxable income equal to the fair market value of the shares, at which time we are required to withhold or receive from him related taxes at statutorily defined rates. In order to facilitate the withholding, Mr. Gottdiener has made an irrevocable election prior to the date of this filing to satisfy the applicable tax withholding through the deduction of that number of shares from the vested amount having an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount required to be so withheld. The withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding will be reported on a Form 4.
