Table of Contents
On April 1, 2008, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (the "Company") closed its sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"), pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated March 27, 2008, among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. The Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1. The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $397 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company will use the aggregate net proceeds to repay approximately $397 million of indebtedness under its revolving credit facility. The Notes are the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally with all of its current and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under its senior credit facilities, and senior to all of its future subordinated debt. The Indenture (defined below) does not prohibit the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of March 14, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2013. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2008. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, respectively.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture, filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 14, 2006, and the Form of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2013 attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.

(b) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, substantially in the form attached as Schedule IV hereto and file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
(c) If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

(v) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company;
(vi) the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);

(viii) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

(i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that on the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion); and
(ii) such counsel has no reason to believe that the documents specified in a schedule to such counsel's letter, consisting of those included in the Disclosure Package and the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, when taken together as a whole, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In rendering such opinion and letter, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion and letter, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
In addition, the Representatives shall have received from Jeffrey S. Hurwitz, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, an opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:
(iii) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the law of the State of Delaware;
 
(iv) all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(v) the Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
(vi) such counsel does not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries that would be required to be disclosed in Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and is not so disclosed, and such counsel does not know of any documents that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed or of any documents that are required to be summarized in the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus and are not so summarized.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent he deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom he believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent he deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (c) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
(c) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chief Financial Officer and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any supplements or amendments thereto and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
 
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice that would prevent its use or the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no change or development that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(e) The Company shall have requested and caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached as Annex B hereto confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
 
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Company, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on the Closing Date.
7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
Indemnification and Contribution
 
, , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
provided
however
 
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereto. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the
provided
however
 
Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter
provided
however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Successors
14. . The Company hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company and (c) the Company's engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No fiduciary duty
15. . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

In connection with the Registration Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit made in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph.

Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any such changes, increases or decreases in consolidated net current assets (working capital), shareholders' equity, consolidated net sales, or the total or per-share amounts of net income for the periods referred to above.
On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change in the capital stock or increase in long-term debt, except that we have been informed by officials of the Company that there continues to be an increase in long-term debt, that is estimated to be approximately $ -  million as of March  - , 2008, and except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur.

Note: A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time.
Interest Rate Adjustment
The interest rate payable on the senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either of Fitch Inc., a subsidiary of Fimalac, S.A., and its successors ("Fitch"), or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc., and its successors ("S&P"), or any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the senior notes, in the manner described below.
If the rating of the senior notes from Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the senior notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
 
If the rating of the senior notes from S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the senior notes will increase from the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on the senior notes has been adjusted upward and either Fitch or S&P (or either Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the senior notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the senior notes will be decreased such that the interest rate for the senior notes equals the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance plus the applicable percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the senior notes to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the senior notes will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Fitch, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the senior notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the senior notes exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the senior notes shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies (as defined under "Description of Senior NotesChange of Control Offer to Repurchase" in The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation's preliminary prospectus supplement, dated March 19, 2008 to the prospectus, dated March 19, 2008) provide a rating of the senior notes, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the senior notes from another Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if another such Rating Agency rates the senior notes (such rating agency, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the senior notes pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the senior notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by us and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above
with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Fitch or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the senior notes will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the senior notes on their date of issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the senior notes, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the senior notes necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the senior notes, the interest rate on the senior notes will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the senior notes on the date of their issuance.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Fitch or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency changes its rating of the senior notes more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease described above relating to such agency's action.
If the interest rate payable on the senior notes is increased as described in this "Interest Rate Adjustment," the term "interest," as applicable to the senior notes, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: April 1, 2008
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 14, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000, subject to certain exceptions referred to in the Indenture. In addition, the Company may from time to time without the consent of the Holders of Securities create and issue further securities having the same terms and conditions as the Securities in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date and issue price) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding securities of this series (including the Securities) or upon such terms as the Company may determine at the time of their issue. References herein to the Securities include (unless the context requires otherwise) any other securities issued as described in this paragraph and forming a single series with the Securities.
The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' notice by mail, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time and from time to time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the Securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 55 basis points plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealers as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities.

Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors unless any of them shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other two Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Treasury Reference Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities, Holders of Securities will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Securities pursuant to the offer described below (a "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of Holders of Securities on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date.
Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, or at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Company will be required to send, by first class mail, a notice to Holders of Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The notice, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Holders of Securities electing to have Securities purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender their Securities, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Securities completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice, or transfer their Securities to the Paying Agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the Paying Agent, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.

(2) the consummation of any transaction (including without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company, measured by voting power rather than number of shares;
(3) the Company consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Company, in a transaction in which any of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company or such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Voting Stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction;
(4) the first day on which the majority of the members of the board of directors of the Company cease to be Continuing Directors; or
(5) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

"Continuing Director" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the board of directors of the Company who:
(1) was a member of such board of directors on the date of the issuance of the Securities; or
 
(2) was nominated for election or elected to such board of directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election.
"Fitch" means Fitch Inc., a subsidiary of Fimalac, S.A., and its successors.
"Investment Grade" means a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P) and a rating of BBB- or better by Fitch (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Fitch).

"Voting Stock" of any specified person as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
The interest rate payable on the Securities will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either of Fitch or S&P, or any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities, in the manner described below.
If the rating of the Securities from Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities will increase from the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
 
If the rating of the Securities from S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities will increase from the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Securities has been adjusted upward and either Fitch or S&P (or either Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Securities to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Securities will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Securities equals the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance plus the applicable percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Securities to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Securities will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Fitch, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Securities be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Securities, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities from another Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if another such Rating Agency rates the Securities (such rating agency, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Securities pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Fitch or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Securities will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Securities on their
 
date of issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, the interest rate on the Securities will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Fitch or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency changes its rating of the Securities more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period will control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease described above relating to such agency's action.
If the interest rate payable on the Securities is increased as described above, the term "interest," as applicable to the Securities, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
This Security shall have the benefit of the covenants and agreements set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
