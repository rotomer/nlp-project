Short Hills, NJ  July 31, 2008  D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information, tools and commercial insight, today reported final results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. These results are unchanged from the preliminary second quarter 2008 results the Company announced on July 14, 2008, in conjunction with its Investor Day event.
Second Quarter 2008 Results
before non-core gains and charges for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, were $1.15, up 20 percent from $0.96 in the prior year similar period. These results were primarily driven by operating income growth and additionally benefitted from the timing of tax benefits and share repurchases, partially offset by interest costs. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, were $1.51, up 3% from $1.46 in the prior year similar period, due primarily to the resolution of a legacy tax matter with the IRS in the 2007 second quarter, which resulted in a $0.52 per diluted share, net non-core gain.
Diluted earnings per share
See attached Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges to earnings per share on a GAAP basis, as well as the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to evaluate the business.

Second Quarter 2008 Segment Results
United States

See attached Schedules 4 and 5 for additional detail.
for the second quarter of 2008 was $105.3 million, up 10 percent from the prior year similar period. The increase was primarily due to improved revenue in the U.S. segment, partially offset by higher selling expenses and higher costs associated with acquisitions and investments to enhance the Company's strategic capabilities.

Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the second quarter of 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they are not a component of its ongoing income or expenses and may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing underlying business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2008 Outlook Confirmed
D&B confirmed the following full year financial guidance for 2008:
 
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial
 
measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2007, filed February 25, 2008 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
