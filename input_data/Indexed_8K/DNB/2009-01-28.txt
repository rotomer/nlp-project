D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
Full Year 2009 Guidance
D&B today provided the following financial guidance for the full year 2009:
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
2009 Financial Flexibility
D&B continues to create financial flexibility through several reengineering initiatives aimed at complexity reduction, including the following:
 
 
 
 
D&B expects its ongoing reengineering initiatives to create $90 million to $105 million of financial flexibility in 2009, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. The Company expects to incur transition costs of approximately $17 million to $22 million and pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $22 million to $30 million associated with its ongoing reengineering efforts.
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
Cash Dividend Increased
D&B today announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share, up from D&B's prior dividend payout of $0.30 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 20, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2009. This increase in D&B's quarterly cash dividend is a reflection of the Company's confidence in its ability to generate continued strong free cash flow growth in 2009.

D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2007, filed February 25, 2008 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors.
