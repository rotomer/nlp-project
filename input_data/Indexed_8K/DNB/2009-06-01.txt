Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this filing is to report to you that we have sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our domestic Italian operations.
D&B has taken another step in advancing our International strategy to support higher profit margins and superior data quality. On May 31, 2009, D&B completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our Italian operations to CRIF, S.p.A., one of the largest providers of business information in Italy, for $11 million in cash, net of certain liabilities at closing. Our domestic Italian operations generated approximately $48 million in revenue and approximately $1 million in operating income in 2008.
Simultaneous with closing this transaction, we entered into a ten year commercial arrangement to provide CRIF with global data for its Italian customers. This arrangement has aggregate future cash payments of approximately $130 million, which will allow us to realize slightly higher revenue and higher operating income for this portion of the business on an annualized basis than D&B achieved on our own in 2008. In addition, this transaction will allow D&B to provide superior data quality to our global customers seeking information on Italian companies.
This transaction has no impact on our previously issued 2009 financial guidance.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
