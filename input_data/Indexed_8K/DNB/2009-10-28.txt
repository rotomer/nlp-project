Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the third quarter of 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.

Full Year 2009 Guidance
D&B today reconfirmed the following financial guidance for the full year 2009:
 
 
 
 
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2008, filed February 24, 2009 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.

As previously announced, D&B will review its third quarter 2009 financial results in a conference call with the investment community on October 29, 2009, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call and other related
