See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
Strategic Technology Investment
The Company announced today a two-year strategic technology investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers.
Once completed, the program is expected to accelerate revenue growth and reduce expenses by improving data quality and timeliness, increasing the speed of product innovation and significantly reducing technology costs. The Company anticipates spending $110 to $130 million over approximately the next two years to complete the program, with $45 to $55 million of the spend occurring in 2010. Approximately 60% of the spend will be recognized as an increase to D&B's non-core expenses and the remainder as capital expenditures. The Company expects annual cost savings of $35 to $50 million once the investment is complete.
"We have an opportunity to transform our customer value proposition," noted Ms. Mathew. "We intend to act decisively on this opportunity, even as the economic outlook is still cloudy, as we are confident it will enhance long term shareholder value and strengthen our competitive advantage even further," concluded Ms. Mathew.
2010 Financial Flexibility
D&B continues to create financial flexibility through several reengineering initiatives aimed at greater efficiency and productivity, including the following:
 
 
 
 
D&B expects its ongoing reengineering initiatives to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility in 2010, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. The Company expects to incur transition costs of approximately $7 million to $12
 
PRESS RELEASE
 
million and pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $15 million to $20 million associated with its ongoing reengineering efforts.
Full Year 2010 Guidance
D&B today provided the following financial guidance for the full year 2010:
 
 
 
 
The impact of our technology investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Cash Dividend Increased
D&B today announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend to $0.35 per share, up from D&B's prior quarterly dividend payout of $0.34 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 18, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 3, 2010.
