Executive Compensation Program
On February 18, 2010, our Compensation & Benefits Committee (the "Committee") took a number of actions in support of our executive compensation program. This program is designed to:
 
 
 
 
 
By achieving these objectives the Committee believes that our executive compensation program will support the execution of the Company's strategy and, in that way, continue to create shareholder value.
2010 Annual Cash Incentive Plan
The actions taken by the Committee include the approval of our 2010 Annual Cash Incentive Plan, which is awarded under the D&B Covered Employee Cash Incentive Plan (the "CIP"), as last approved by shareholders in 2006. This plan is intended to provide incentives to certain team members, including executive officers, in the form of cash award payments. Payments are based on performance against predetermined annual measures that were set by the Committee after a detailed review by the Board of Directors of the Company's 2010 business plan.
The Company's executive officers were designated by the Committee as participants in the CIP. Under the CIP, the Committee established a maximum annual cash incentive opportunity of eight-tenths of one percent of the Company's 2010 earnings before income taxes for the Chief Executive Officer and five-tenths of one percent of the Company's 2010 earnings before income taxes for each of the other executive officers of the Company. Actual annual cash incentive payouts to the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers of the Company may be less than these maximums.
In determining incentive payouts under this plan, the Committee will consider: (i) the Company's overall performance; and (ii) an adjustment for the achievement of individual goals and an assessment of the individual's demonstrated leadership competencies. The Committee also utilizes a Company Scorecard, as further described below, when considering total incentive payouts.
With respect to Company performance, the Committee considers performance against four measures or goals weighted as follows: 30% to Company-wide core revenue growth; 30% to growth in diluted earnings per share ("EPS") and total operating income; 20% to our Customer Satisfaction Index (as measured by the Company's Voice of the Customer Survey); and 20% to our Strategy goal which measures progress against key data strategy and technology re-platforming objectives. In considering such performance metrics, the Committee may exclude the impact of non-core gains and charges or extraordinary items. Target levels of performance have been or will be established for each performance goal, which will result in a full incentive payout being earned if the target for the measure is achieved. Achievement below the target will result in a smaller or no incentive payout for that measure and
 
Table of Contents
achievement above the target will yield a larger incentive payout. The potential range of incentive payout for each performance goal is from 0% to 200%; however, the aggregate incentive payout for all performance goals may not exceed the maximum annual cash incentive opportunity generated by the pre-tax earnings formula set forth above or three million dollars as stipulated in the CIP, whichever is less.
The Company performance metric as applied to each individual will be further adjusted based on the executive's achievement of individual goals and assessed demonstration of leadership competencies. Such adjustment may range from 0% to 200% times the Company performance component; provided, however, that in no instance will such adjustment result in an individual receiving an incentive in excess of the maximum annual cash incentive opportunity generated by the pre-tax earnings formula.
In exceptional cases, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may apply additional positive or negative adjustments to payouts to individual executive officers, including the Chairman and the CEO. In no instance, however, will such adjustments exceed the maximum annual cash incentive opportunity generated by the pre-tax earnings formula.
To ensure that total cash incentive payments to all participants including the executive officers are aligned with overall Company results, performance will also be reviewed against the criteria established by the Company's Scorecard for 2010 that was approved by the Committee. The Company Scorecard is based on three performance criteria: first, Company-wide 2010 core revenue growth; second, 2010 growth in EPS; and third, a principles-based assessment by the Committee of the Company's overall performance. Upon review of performance against these criteria, the Committee may increase or decrease the size of the total incentive pool to ensure alignment with overall Company results. In no instance will the Company Scorecard permit the individual annual cash incentive for the Chairman, the CEO and other executive officers to exceed the maximum amount as determined by the pre-tax earnings formula.
2010 Performance-based Restricted Stock Unit Opportunity
To the cash component of our executive compensation program we also add an equity component. Where cash is tied to the achievement of short-term results, equity is directly linked to the creation of increased shareholder value over the longer term. Under our long-term incentive program, 50% of the total value of the executive's equity compensation is in the form of a performance-based restricted stock unit opportunity with the remaining 50% in the form of non-qualified stock options.
The performance-based restricted stock unit opportunity reinforces our pay for performance objective in that any actual award of restricted stock units must be earned based on attainment of the same performance goals that are used in the target annual cash incentive plan. The goals and process described above will also be used at the conclusion of 2010 to determine actual restricted stock unit grants relative to the 2010 performance-based restricted stock unit opportunity provided to the Chairman, the CEO and other executive officers. However, unlike the annual cash incentive plan, the performance-based restricted stock unit opportunity is capped at 100% if D&B's 3-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance (2008-2010) is less than the 60
th
percentile of the S&P 500 and compensation peer group. D&B's TSR performance at or above the 60
th
percentile adjusts the cap to 200% of opportunity. If, for example, the executive officer's actual cash incentive expressed as a percent of his or her target cash incentive opportunity is 125%, then the performance-based restricted stock unit award would be capped at 100% if D&B's TSR result is below the 60
th
percentile; however, if D&B's TSR performance is at or above the 60
th
percentile, then the performance-based restricted stock unit award would be 125% since the cap would be adjusted to 200% of opportunity.

Retirement of Director
On February 19, 2010, Victor A. Pelson announced that he is retiring from our Board of Directors effective in May 2010 immediately prior to our next Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer (the "") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items related to the Participant's participation in the Plan (""), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Employer. The Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSU grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSU, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividend equivalents or dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSU to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Company and/or Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Employer
Tax-Related Items
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Award, it is a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Shares that the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding of Tax-Related Items of the Company and/or the Employer. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from a payment of cash or check from the Participant, (2) withholding from the Participant's wages or other cash
 
compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer, (3) from proceeds of the sale of the Shares, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization), or (4) withholding from Shares to be issued upon vesting of the RSU. Anything in this Section 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the right of the Company or the Employer to withhold any Tax-Related Items for any portion of the RSUs that is considered deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be limited to the minimum amount permitted to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Code Section 409A.
(c) To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items (including withholding pursuant to applicable tax equalization policies of the Company or its Affiliates) by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the Company withholds in shares, it may deduct from the total number of Shares that have become vested that number of Shares having a fair market value equal to the applicable amount of withholding taxes due.
(d) Finally, the Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.
9. . If there is a Change in Control of the Company, any unvested RSUs shall become fully vested as of the date of the Change in Control the Participant remains in the continuous employ of the Company or its Affiliates from the Award Date until the date of the Change in Control.

(b) Anything in the provisions of this Award to the contrary notwithstanding, the delivery of the Shares subject to of the Award or any other payment under this Award that constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and becomes payable to the Participant by reason of his or her termination of employment shall not be made to such Participant unless his or her termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A). In addition, if such Participant is at the time of such separation from service a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), the delivery of the Shares (or other payment) described in the foregoing sentence shall be made to the Participant on the earlier of (i) the first day immediately following the expiration of the six-month period measured from such Participant's separation from service, or (ii) the date of the Participant's death, to the extent such delayed payment is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under U.S. Treasury Regulations issued under Code Section 409A.
(c) Until the Company determines otherwise, delivery of Shares on each applicable settlement date will be administered by the Company's transfer agent or an independent third-party broker selected from time to time by the Company.
 
11. .

In furtherance of this intent, the provisions of this Award will be interpreted, operated, and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions. The Committee may modify the terms of this Award, the Plan or both, without the consent of the Participant, beneficiary or such other person, in the manner that the Committee may determine to be necessary or advisable in order to comply with Code Section 409A and to avoid the imposition of any penalty tax or other adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. This Section 13 does not create an obligation on the part of the Company to modify the terms of this Award or the Plan and does not guarantee that the Award or the delivery of Shares under the Award will not be subject to taxes, interest and penalties or any other adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. The Company will have no liability to the Participant or any other party if the Award, the delivery of Shares upon settlement of the Award or other payment hereunder that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Code Section 409A, is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto.

Entire Agreement
 
07078. The Plan and this Award constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior understandings and agreements with respect to such subject matter. To the extent any provision of this Award is inconsistent or in conflict with any term or provision of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. Any action taken or decision made by the Committee arising out of or in connection with the construction, administration, interpretation or effect of this Award shall be within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Participant and all persons claiming under or through the Participant.
15. Nothing contained in the Plan or this Award shall give the Participant any right to be retained in the employment of the Company or its Affiliates or affect the right of any such Employer to terminate the Participant. The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not constitute an inducement to, or condition of, the employment of any Participant. The Plan is a discretionary plan, and participation by the Participant is purely voluntary. Further, the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. Participation in the Plan with respect to this Award shall not entitle the Participant to participate with respect to any other award in the future, or benefits in lieu of RSUs, even if RSUs have been granted repeatedly in the past. Any payment or benefit paid to the Participant with respect to this Award shall not be considered to be part of the Participant's "salary," and thus, shall not be taken into account for purposes of calculating any termination indemnity, severance pay, redundancy, dismissal, end of service payment, bonuses, long-service awards, retirement, pension, welfare benefits, or any other employee benefits. In no event should the Award be considered as compensation for or relating to, past services for the Company, the Employer, or any Affiliate of the Company, nor are RSUs and the Shares subject to the RSUs intended to replace any pension rights or compensation. All decisions with respect to future RSUs, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. In the event that the Participant is not an employee of the Company, the RSU grant will not be interpreted to form an employment contract or relationship with the Company, the

In consideration of the grant of RSUs, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from termination of the Participant's employment by the Company or the Employer (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Participant irrevocably releases the Company and the Employer from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by accepting this Award, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived the Participant's entitlement to pursue such claim. In the event of involuntary termination of the Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local labor laws), the Participant's right to receive RSUs and vest in RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of "garden leave" or similar period pursuant to local law). The Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Participant's RSU grant.
16. . This Award shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all successors and assigns of the Company and the Participant, including without limitation, the estate of the Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participant's creditors.

This Appendix forms part of the Award. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Award and the Plan.
This Appendix also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which the Participant should be aware with respect to the Participant's participation in the Plan.

Accordingly, the Participant is advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in the Participant's country may apply to the Participant's situation.
Finally, if the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which the Participant is currently working or transfers employment after the Grant Date, the information contained herein may not be applicable to the Participant.

3. . If the Participant's employment with the Company and its Affiliates terminates for any reason, other than a termination made by the Company without Cause (as defined in that certain Employment Agreement dated as of December 31, 2004, as amended, by and between the Company and Participant), prior to June 30, 2010, the Participant shall forfeit all rights to and interests in the RSUs. If the Participant's employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to June 30, 2010, the Participant's rights under this Award shall continue as if such employment terminated on or after June 30, 2010, pursuant to Section 4 of this Award.

Voting
6. . Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event that a dividend is paid on Shares, an amount equal to such dividend shall be credited for the benefit of the Participant based on the number of RSUs credited to the Participant as of the dividend record date, and such credited dividend amount shall be in the form of an additional number of RSUs (which may include fractional RSUs) based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date. The additional RSUs credited in connection with a dividend will be subject to the same restrictions as the RSUs in respect of which the dividend was paid, including, without limitation, the provisions governing time and form of settlement or payment applicable to the associated RSUs.
Dividend Equivalents
 
7. . The RSUs are non-transferable and may not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to effect any such disposition, or upon the levy of any such process, the RSUs that have not been settled shall immediately be forfeited.

8. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer (the "") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items related to the Participant's participation in the Plan (""), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Employer. The Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSU grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the RSU, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired and the receipt of any dividend equivalents or dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSU to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Company and/or Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Employer
Tax-Related Items
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Award, it is a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Shares that the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding of Tax-Related Items of the Company and/or the Employer. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items by one or a combination
 
of the following: (1) withholding from a payment of cash or check from the Participant, (2) withholding from the Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer, (3) from proceeds of the sale of the Shares, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant's behalf pursuant to this authorization), or (4) withholding from Shares to be issued upon vesting of the RSU. Anything in this Section 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the right of the Company or the Employer to withhold any Tax-Related Items for any portion of the RSUs that is considered deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be limited to the minimum amount permitted to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Code Section 409A.
(c) To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items (including withholding pursuant to applicable tax equalization policies of the Company or its Affiliates) by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the Company withholds in shares, it may deduct from the total number of Shares that have become vested that number of Shares having a fair market value equal to the applicable amount of withholding taxes due.
(d) Finally, the Participant shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section.
9. . If there is a Change in Control of the Company, any unvested RSUs shall become fully vested as of the date of the Change in Control the Participant remains in the continuous employ of the Company or its Affiliates from the Award Date until the date of the Change in Control.

10. .
Delivery of Shares
(a) The Shares subject to the Award shall be delivered on (i) the applicable Vesting Dates or, (ii) if earlier, the earliest vesting event contemplated under (1) Section 4 above in connection with the Participant's death or the termination of the Participant's employment due to Disability or Retirement or (2) Section 9 above in connection with a Change in Control; provided, however, that if the Award or settlement of the Award constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and the Change in Control is not a "change in control event" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, the Shares subject to the Award shall be delivered in accordance with the applicable Vesting Dates or, if earlier, the earliest vesting event contemplated under Section 4 in connection with the Participant's death or the termination of the Participant's employment due to Disability or Retirement.
(b) Anything in the provisions of this Award to the contrary notwithstanding, the delivery of the Shares subject to of the Award or any other payment under this Award that constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and becomes payable to the Participant by reason of his or her termination of employment shall not be made to such Participant unless his or her termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A). In addition, if such Participant is at the time of such separation from service a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), the delivery of the Shares (or other payment) described in the foregoing sentence shall be made to the Participant on the earlier of (i) the first day immediately following the expiration of the six-month period measured from such Participant's separation from service, or (ii) the date of the Participant's death, to the extent such delayed payment is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under U.S. Treasury Regulations issued under Code Section 409A.
(c) Until the Company determines otherwise, delivery of Shares on each applicable settlement date will be administered by the Company's transfer agent or an independent third-party broker selected from time to time by the Company.

The Company will have no liability to the Participant or any other party if the Award, the delivery of Shares upon settlement of the Award or other payment hereunder that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Code Section 409A, is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto.
