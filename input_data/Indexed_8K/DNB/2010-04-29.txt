Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Short Hills, NJ  April 29, 2010  D&B (NYSE: DNB), the leading provider of global business information, tools and commercial insight, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
"Our first quarter results for both International and North America were in line with our expectations. International delivered another strong quarter of double digit growth, as demand for our cross border data remains strong. As expected, North America's performance was similar to the prior quarter and we expect gradual improvement during the rest of the year as the economy improves and we move past the weak demand from 2009. We are comfortable with full year 2010 guidance ranges and look forward to sharing our strategic vision for the business and our roadmap for success at our upcoming Investor Day," stated Sara Mathew, D&B's President and CEO.
 
First Quarter 2010 Results
before non-core gains and charges for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, were $1.29; down 3% from $1.33 in the prior year similar period.
Diluted earnings per share
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 were $0.92, down 52% (includes a $0.26 charge described in the paragraph below), from $1.93 in the prior year similar period (which included a $0.62 tax benefit derived from our worldwide legal entity simplification).
Our first quarter diluted EPS, includes a $0.26 non-cash charge resulting from the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Healthcare Act of 2010"). The charge is due to a reduction in the value of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursement.
See attached Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges to earnings per share on a GAAP basis, as well as the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to evaluate the business.
for the first quarter of 2010 was $397.2 million, down 1% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (flat after the effect of foreign exchange). Deferred revenue was $577.2 million, up 2% before the effect of foreign exchange (up 4% after the effect of foreign exchange), continuing the positive trajectory that began during the fourth quarter of 2009.
Core revenue
Core revenue results for the first quarter of 2010 reflect the following by solution set:

for the first quarter of 2010 was $397.2 million. This result is down 4%, before the effect of foreign exchange (down 3% after the effect of foreign exchange), as compared to the prior year period, which included the results of our domestic Italian operations divested in the second quarter of 2009.
Total revenue
We reclassified revenue associated with the domestic portion of our Italian operations as non-core as of the quarter ending June 30, 2009, due to the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with that portion of the business (see the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2009). Total revenue for the first quarter of 2009 included $10.3 million of revenue associated with the domestic portion of our Italian operations, with no revenue from those operations in the first quarter of 2010.
before non-core gains and charges for the first quarter of 2010 was $102.7 million, down 11% from the prior year similar period and in line with our expectations. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $93.3 million, down 19% from the prior year similar period, which includes $4.8 million of costs related to the Strategic Technology Investment, announced in February 2010.
Operating income
before non-core gains and charges for the first quarter of 2010 was $66.2 million down 8% from the prior year similar period and in line with our expectations. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to D&B for the quarter was $47.0 million, down 55% from the prior year similar period, primarily due to an unfavorable comparison to the first quarter 2009 that included a tax benefit derived from worldwide legal entity simplification, as well as a charge in the first quarter of 2010 related to the reduction of a deferred tax asset attributable to the recently enacted Healthcare Act of 2010.
Net income attributable to D&B
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
for the first quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of legacy tax matters, was $110.1 million, in line with our expectations, compared with $107.7 million in the prior year similar period.The Company defines free cash flow as net

cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. On a GAAP basis, net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2010 was $128.5 million, compared with $122.9 million in the prior year similar period.
See attached Schedule 4 for additional detail.
during the first quarter of 2010 under the Company's discretionary repurchase program totaled $25.0 million (approximately 0.3 million shares), while repurchases made to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans totaled an additional $39.8 million (approximately 0.5 million shares).
Share repurchases
The Company ended the quarter with $218.7 million of cash and cash equivalents.
First Quarter 2010 Segment Results
North America
for the first quarter of 2010 was $304.9 million, down 6% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (down 5% after the effect of foreign exchange).
Core and total revenue
Overall, first quarter total North America revenue results were in line with the Company's expectations. Risk Management Solutions was slightly lower than anticipated while Sales & Marketing Solutions performed stronger than expected.
As a reminder, we continue to experience the negative revenue impact from the lower upfront sales commitments in 2009, which is predominantly felt in Risk Management Solutions due to the subscription nature of these products. We expect North American revenue to gradually improve throughout the year as we anniversary last year's lower upfront commitment levels and we benefit from the improving economy.
North America core and total revenue results for the first quarter of 2010 reflect the following:
 
 
Page 4 of 11
DNBi continues to perform very well as penetration increased to 62% of Risk Management Solutions revenue in the first quarter of 2010, compared to 51% in the first quarter of 2009 and we continue to see very good price lifts. As discussed in prior quarters, DNBi's growth was offset by continued declines in our legacy transactional products. Looking ahead, we expect Risk Management Solutions' revenue to gradually improve throughout the year, as the overhang from 2009 diminishes. As such, we believe full-year 2010 growth will decline in the low single digits.
 
The performance of Sales & Marketing Solutions improved from prior quarters and we expect this trend to continue through 2010. Our value added products are beginning to benefit from the improving economy and our retention rates improved in the quarter. Moving forward, we expect Sales & Marketing Solutions' full-year 2010 revenue to grow by low single digits.
 
for the first quarter of 2010 was $105.3 million, down 15% from the prior year similar period and in line with our expectations. The result was primarily due to lower revenue and increased investments in our business, partially offset by reengineering savings.
Operating income
International
for the first quarter of 2010 was $92.3 million, up 15% (up 6% organically) from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (up 22% after the effect of foreign exchange).
Core revenue

International continues to perform very well as we realize the benefits from our exposure to high growth emerging markets and strong demand for our cross border and value added products.
International core revenue results for the first quarter of 2010 reflect the following:
 
 
 
for the first quarter of 2010 was also $92.3 million, up 1% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (up 7% after the effect of foreign exchange). The results of the domestic portion of our Italian operation, which we divested in the second quarter of 2009, are included in the prior year period total revenue.
Total revenue
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the first quarter of 2010 was $13.4 million, up 15% from the prior year similar period and in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, lower costs from our divestiture of the domestic portion of our Italian operations, which we divested in the second quarter of 2009, and the benefit of reengineering savings.
Operating income
Strategic Technology Investment
During February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. The Company anticipates spending $110 million to $130 million over approximately the next two years to complete the program.
In the first quarter of 2010, the Company incurred $4.8 million of total pre-tax expense (or $0.06 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, all of which was included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below.
 
Page 6 of 11
While we anticipate the level of spending to increase throughout the remainder of the year, the program is on pace to meet our previous estimate for total pre-tax spend during 2010 of $45 million to $55 million. As we noted in our fourth quarter earnings release (February 4, 2010) approximately 60% of this spend will be recognized as an increase to D&B's non-core expenses and the remainder as capital expenditures.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2010 Guidance
D&B today reconfirmed the following financial guidance for the full year 2010:
 
 
 
Page 7 of 11
 
As a reminder, the impact of our Strategic Technology Investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009, filed February 25, 2010 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
2010 Investor Day
As previously announced, D&B will host its 2010 Investor Day event on Monday, May 10, 2010, at the Jumeirah Essex House in New York City (160 Central Park South at 59

Street). An event registration page for investors and analysts is now available on D&B's investor relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
