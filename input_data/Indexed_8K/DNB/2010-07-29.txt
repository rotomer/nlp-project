Second Quarter 2010 Results
before non-core gains and charges for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 were $1.23, up 2% from $1.21 in the prior year similar period.
Diluted earnings per share
On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 were $1.10 down 23%, from $1.43 in the prior year similar period, largely due to a one-time gain associated with the disposal of the domestic portion of our Italian operations.
See attached Schedule 3 for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share before non-core gains and charges to earnings per share on a GAAP basis, as well as the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to evaluate the business.
for the second quarter of 2010 was $397.3 million, down 3% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (down 2% after the effect of foreign exchange). Deferred revenue was $535.9 million, up 3% from the similar prior year period, continuing the positive trajectory that began in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Core revenue
Core revenue results for the second quarter of 2010 reflect the following by solution set:
 
 
 
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the second quarter of 2010 was $397.3 million, down 5%, both before and after the effect of foreign exchange, as compared to the prior year similar period. As a reminder, the prior year included the results of the domestic portion of our Italian operations which we divested in the second quarter of 2009.
Total revenue
 
 
 
We reclassified revenue associated with the domestic portion of our Italian operations as non-core as of the quarter ending June 30, 2009, due to the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with that portion of the business (see the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2009). Total revenue for the second quarter of 2009 included $11.6 million of revenue associated with the domestic portion of our Italian operations, with no revenue from those operations in the second quarter of 2010.
before non-core gains and charges for the second quarter of 2010 was $106.5 million, down 6% from the prior year similar period. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $90.5 million, down 18% from the prior year similar period. Our second quarter 2010 results includes $7.6 million of costs related to the Strategic Technology Investment, announced in February 2010 and a $6.8 million charge for impaired assets related to our QED acquisition resulting from an examination of such assets initiated in connection with recent matters with Federal Trade Commission.
Operating income
before non-core gains and charges for the second quarter of 2010 was $62.7 million, down 3% from the prior year similar period. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to D&B for the quarter was $56.0 million, down 27% from the prior year similar period, primarily due to a gain of $12.8 million related to the disposal of the domestic portion of our Italian operations during the second quarter of 2009.
Net income attributable to D&B
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
for the first six months of 2010, excluding the impact of legacy tax matters, was $172.5 million, including approximately $8.0 million related to the Strategic Technology Investment, compared with $192.0 million in the prior year similar period.The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. On a GAAP basis, net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2010 was $211.0 million, compared with $234.4 million in the prior year similar period.
Free cash flow
See attached Schedule 4 for additional detail.
 
 
 
during the second quarter of 2010 under the Company's discretionary repurchase program totaled $20.0 million (approximately 0.3 million shares), while repurchases made to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under employee benefit plans totaled an additional $10.0 million (approximately 0.1 million shares).
Share repurchases
The Company ended the quarter with $209.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, almost all of which is held in subsidiaries outside the United States.
Second Quarter 2010 Segment Results
North America
for the second quarter of 2010 was $300.9 million, down 6% from the prior year similar period both before and after the effect of foreign exchange.
Core and total revenue
We saw a sequential year-over-year improvement in Risk Management Solutions revenue; however, our Sales & Marketing Solutions weakened versus the prior quarter. We attribute the weakness to tight budget constraints with our customers, especially on the prospecting side.
We continue to expect our revenues will improve during the back half of the year as we work through the lower upfront sales commitments experienced during 2009 and we are taking actions to improve certain weaker segments of our businesses.
North America core and total revenue results for the second quarter of 2010 reflect the following:
 
DNBi continues to perform well as penetration increased to 63% of Risk Management Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2009, due to the on going migration of transaction based customers to DNBi as well as price lifts in the mid to high single digit range. Similar to prior quarters, DNBi's growth was more than offset by declines in our legacy transactional products. Looking ahead, we
 
 
 
 
The second quarter performance of Sales & Marketing Solutions mostly reflects weaker demand at the back-end of the quarter from our largest customers, as well as timing differences in contract renewals impacting our traditional lists and labels business.
 
before non-core gains and charges for the second quarter of 2010 was $105.2 million, down 5% from the prior year similar period. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $98.4 million, down 11% from the prior year similar period. The result was primarily due to lower revenue and a $6.8 million charge for impaired assets related to our QED acquisition resulting from an examination of such assets initiated in connection with recent matters with Federal Trade Commission.
Operating income
International
for the second quarter of 2010 was $96.4 million, up 11% (inorganic activity contributed 8 points of the growth) from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (up 14% after the effect of foreign exchange).
Core revenue
International continues to perform very well as we realize the benefits from our exposure to high growth emerging markets and strong demand for our cross border and value added products.
International core revenue results for the second quarter of 2010 reflect the following:
 
 
 
 
 
For full-year 2010, we continue to expect total International revenue to grow at a low double digit rate, driven by the launch of DNBi International and sustained high growth in our emerging markets.
for the second quarter of 2010 was $96.4 million, down 2% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (flat after the effect of foreign exchange). The results of the domestic portion of our Italian operation, which we divested in the second quarter of 2009, are included in the prior year similar period total revenue.
Total revenue
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the second quarter of 2010 was $19.3 million, down 15% from the prior year similar period. The decrease is primarily due to a tough comparison to the second quarter 2009 (in which operating income benefitted from lower expenses prior to the sale of our domestic Italian operation), partially offset by growth in our underlying business.
Operating income
Strategic Technology Investment
As a reminder, in February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. The Company anticipates spending $110 million to $130 million over the approximate two-year life of the program.
In the second quarter of 2010, the Company incurred $7.7 million of total pre-tax expense (or $0.11 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $3.8 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
 
 
 
Year to date, we have incurred $12.5 million of total pre-tax expense (or $0.19 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $3.8 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
The program continues to be on pace to meet our previous estimate for total pre-tax spend during 2010 of $45 million to $55 million, with approximately 60% of the amount recognized as an increase to D&B's non-core expenses and the remainder as capital expenditures (see attached Schedule 3 for additional detail).
During the second quarter, D&B achieved the following results regarding the milestones outlined during our 2010 Investor Day: i) opened a new application development center in Ireland that is focused on global applications development, ii) largely completed the migration of our Data Center to a new facility located in Conway, Arkansas and iii) increased the number of records in our data bases to 168 million (on track to reach our 2010 year-end goal of 175 million).
In addition, D&B is preparing for the fourth quarter 2010 release of the following: i) our replatformed version of DNB.com to enhance the value proposition for legacy transactional customers and ii) the launch of web services for our large customers to help them configure our data to embed into their workflows.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
 
 
 
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
D&B Announces Strategic Partnership
D&B announced it has entered into an agreement for the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its North America Self Awareness Solutions business, in a deal valued at approximately $100 million. Under the terms of the agreement, D&B will receive $10 million in cash at closing and is entitled to annual royalty payments from the buyer for data and brand licensing. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close on July 30, 2010.
The sale is part of a strategic relationship whereby the buyer will operate the acquired business under the name of Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp., and distribute D&B-branded products to the micro customer segment.
The deal is expected to reduce full-year 2010 core revenue by approximately $51 million and full-year 2009 core revenue by approximately $70 million. There will be no impact to total company operating income and our overall 2010 guidance remains unchanged.
As a reminder, D&B's North American Self Awareness Solutions business provides credit on self products for small and micro businesses. This transaction provides D&B with the ability to better focus our resources on our core customer segments and maximize shareholder value.
See schedule 7 for additional detail on the effect this Strategic Partnership will have on our core revenue for 2009 and 2010 year-to-date period.
 
 
 
Full Year 2010 Guidance
D&B today reconfirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2010:
 
 
 
 
As a reminder, the impact of our Strategic Technology Investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009, filed February 25, 2010 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
Second Quarter 2010 Teleconference
As previously announced, D&B will review its second quarter financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Friday, July 30, 2010, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call and other related information, will be accessible on D&B's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
