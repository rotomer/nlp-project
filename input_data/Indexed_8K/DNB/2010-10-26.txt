The momentum we have generated will enable us to exit 2010 and enter 2011 on a strong note," stated Sara Mathew, D&B's Chairman and CEO.

As a reminder, the current and prior year periods include the results of the North American Self Awareness Solutions business which we divested during the third quarter of 2010.
Total revenue
 
 
 
 
We reclassified revenue associated with our North American Self Awareness Solutions business as non-core as of the quarter ending September 30, 2010, due to the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with that business (see the Company's Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2010). Total revenue for the third quarter of 2009 included $16.8 million of revenue associated with the North American Self Awareness Solutions business, with $4.4 million of revenue from that business in the third quarter of 2010.

On a GAAP basis, operating income was $75.0 million down 19% from the prior year similar period due primarily to a $13.6 million charge for impaired intangible assets related to our Purisma business and $11.8 million of costs related to our Strategic Technology Investment.

On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to D&B for the current quarter was $56.5 million, up 5% from the prior year similar period. This was primarily impacted by a $14.1 million gain related to the disposal of North American Self Awareness Solutions business in the third quarter, offset by costs of $9.5 million associated with our Strategic Technology Investment and a charge of $8.6 million for impaired intangible assets related to our Purisma business.
Net income attributable to D&B
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.

On a GAAP basis, operating income was $93.5 million, down 11% from the prior year similar period.

See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the third quarter of 2010 was $14.4 million, down 19% from the prior year similar period. The decrease was primarily related to approximately $3.2 million of one-time transaction fees related to the D&B Australia acquisition as well as approximately $1.5 million negative impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by growth in the underlying business.
Operating income
Strategic Technology Investment
As a reminder, in February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. The Company announced spending $110 million to $130 million over the approximate two-year life of the program.
 
 
 
 
In the third quarter of 2010, the Company incurred $11.9 million of total pre-tax expenses ($0.18 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $0.7 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
Year-to-date, we have incurred $24.4 million of total pre-tax expense ($0.37 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $4.5 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
The program continues to be on pace to meet our previous estimate for total pre-tax spend during 2010 of $45 million to $55 million.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the third quarter of 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2010 Guidance
D&B today reaffirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2010:
 
 
 
 
As a reminder, the impact of our Strategic Technology Investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009, filed February 25, 2010 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
