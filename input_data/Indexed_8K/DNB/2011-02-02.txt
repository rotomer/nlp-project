Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded:
 
For the full year 2010, the Company recorded:
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Strategic Technology Investment
In February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers.
 
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company incurred $12.3 million of total operating expenses (or $0.18 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the non-core gains and charges, and $4.2 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
For the full year 2010, we have incurred $36.5 million of total operating expenses (or $0.55 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which was included in the non-core gains and charges, and $8.8 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
During 2010, D&B achieved the following results regarding the milestones outlined during our 2010 Investor Day: i) opened a new application development center in Ireland that is focused on global applications development, ii) completed the migration of our Data Center to a new facility located in Conway, Arkansas, iii) introduced web service driven products, including the replatformed version of DNB.com, and D&B 360 that leverages the concept of Data as a Service and iv) surpassed our stated year-end data enhancement goals for the number of records in our data bases (188 million actual vs. 2010 year-end goal of 175 million), number of trade scores (25 million actual vs. 2010 year-end goal of 16 million) and the number of linked records (17 million actual vs. 2010 year-end goal of 16 million).
During 2011, the project will largely center on the rebuild of our data supply chain. Given the critical nature of this function, we made the decision to develop the capability in-house, due to the strategic advantages and increased platform flexibility we realize by retaining this expertise. As a result of this change, we now expect the Strategic Technology Investment to be completed during the second half of 2012 and the total cost to be closer to the high end of our previous range of $110 to $130 million.
For the full year 2011, the Company anticipates spending between $55 to $65 million.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
 
 
 
 
2011 Financial Flexibility
D&B continues to create financial flexibility through several reengineering initiatives aimed at greater efficiency and productivity, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
D&B expects its ongoing financial flexibility initiatives to create $75 million to $80 million of financial flexibility in 2011, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. The Company expects to incur transition costs of approximately $5 million to $7 million and pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $10 million to $15 million associated with its ongoing reengineering efforts.
Full Year 2011 Guidance
D&B today provided the following financial guidance for the full year 2011:
 
 
 
 
The impact of our Strategic Technology Investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
Effective January 1, 2011, D&B prospectively adopted the new revenue recognition standard, Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") 2009-13 "Revenue Recognition  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements." The impact of this adoption resulted in accelerating revenue recognition from certain of our products sold in
 
 
 
 
multi-element arrangements that had previously been recognized on a ratable basis and to better reflect the economics of these arrangements. The impact to 2011 is included in our guidance outlined above and is not expected to have a material effect on our 2011 revenue, operating income, diluted EPS or our free cash flow.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Cash Dividend Increased
D&B today announced that it has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, up from D&B's prior quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 16, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2011.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009, filed February 25, 2010 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Teleconference
As previously announced, D&B will review its fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Thursday, February 3, 2011, at 8 a.m. ET.
