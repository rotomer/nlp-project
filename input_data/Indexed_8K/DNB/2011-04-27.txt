Short Hills, NJ  April 27, 2011 - D&B (NYSE: DNB), the world's leading source of commercial information and insight on businesses, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
"Our first quarter performance was in-line with our expectations and we remain on track to meet 2011 guidance. We continue to make good progress with our Strategic Technology Investment, meeting all key milestones during the quarter, and are on pace for completion in the second half of 2012. We are beginning to see positive momentum from the launch of new products, DNBi Professional and D&B360, and expect demand to build as the year unfolds," stated Sara Mathew, D&B's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
First Quarter 2011 Results

On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 were $1.00, up 9% from $0.92 in the prior year similar period.

See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the first quarter of 2011 was $403.6 million, up 1% before the effect of foreign exchange (up 2% after the effect of foreign exchange), as compared to the prior year similar period. As a reminder, total revenue for the first quarter of 2010 included the results of our North American Self Awareness Solutions business which we divested in the third quarter of 2010.
Total revenue
before non-core gains and charges for the first quarter of 2011 was $103.4 million, up 1% from the prior year similar period. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $89.3 million, down 4% from the prior year similar period due primarily to expenses related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
Operating income
before non-core gains and charges for the first quarter of 2011 was $64.5 million, down 3% from the prior year similar period due primarily to timing and tax planning initiatives. On a GAAP basis, net income
Net income attributable to D&B
 
 
 
 
 
attributable to D&B for the current quarter was $49.9 million, up 6% from the prior year similar period.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
for the first three months of 2011, excluding the impact of legacy tax matters, was $118.8 million, compared with $110.1 million in the prior year similar period. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles.

First Quarter 2011 Segment Results
In the first quarter of 2011, D&B realigned its geographic reporting segments in order to be more aligned with our business subsequent to the acquisition of Dun & Bradstreet Australia Holdings Limited ("D&B Australia") during the third quarter 2010. As such, along with North America, we now report two new segments, Asia Pacific and Europe & Other International Markets, which replace our prior International segment.
As a reminder, first quarter results for D&B's Asia Pacific and Europe & Other International Markets reporting segments are for the three month period ending February 28th. Therefore, the natural disasters in Japan that occurred during March 2011 had no impact to Asia Pacific's first quarter 2011 results. Additionally,
 
 
 
 
 
we anticipate only a small impact to our full year performance, resulting in no change to our 2011 guidance.
North America
for the first quarter of 2011 was $291.2 million, flat from the prior year similar period both before and after the effect of foreign exchange.
Core revenue
North America core revenue results for the first quarter of 2011 reflect the following:
 
 
 
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional details.
for the first quarter of 2011 was $291.2 million, down 5% from the prior year similar period both before and after the effect of foreign exchange. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2010 included the results of our Self Awareness Solutions business which we divested in the third quarter of 2010.
Total revenue
for the first quarter of 2011 was $106.9 million, up 2% from the prior year similar period, primarily due to lower technology expenses related to reduced data center costs as well as savings from our on-going Financial Flexibility program.
Operating income
Asia Pacific
for the first quarter of 2011 was $53.1 million, up 55% (the acquisition of D&B Australia contributed 58 percentage points of the growth) from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (up 62% after the effect of foreign exchange).
Core and total revenue
 
 
 
 
 
Asia Pacific core and total revenue results for the first quarter of 2011 reflect the following:
 
 
 
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
for the first quarter of 2011 was a loss of $1.9 million, compared to income of $0.1 million from the prior year similar period. The decrease was primarily related to ongoing challenges in Japan and the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Operating income/loss
Europe & Other International Markets
for the first quarter of 2011 was $59.3 million, up 2% from the prior year similar period before the effect of foreign exchange (down 1% after the effect of foreign exchange).
Core and total revenue
Europe & Other International Markets core and total revenue results for the first quarter of 2011 reflect the following:
 
 
 
See attached Schedules 4, 5 and 6 for additional detail.
 
 
 
 
 
for the first quarter of 2011 was $11.1 million, down 17% from the prior year similar period. The decrease was primarily related to the timing of investments, higher year-over-year amortization and marketing expenses related to the roll-out of DNBi and the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Operating income
Strategic Technology Investment
In February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers.
In the first quarter of 2011, the Company incurred $9.9 million of total pre-tax expenses (or $0.16 per diluted share) on the Strategic Technology Investment, which is included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $3.4 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to the Strategic Technology Investment.
For the full year 2011, the Company anticipates spending between $55 to $65 million for the Strategic Technology Investment.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the
 
 
 
 
 
Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2011 Guidance
D&B today reaffirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2011:
 
 
 
 
The impact of our Strategic Technology Investment has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2010, filed March 1, 2011 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful
 
 
 
 
 
information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
First Quarter 2011 Teleconference
As previously announced, D&B will review its first quarter financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Thursday, April 28, 2011, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call and other related information, will be accessible on D&B's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
