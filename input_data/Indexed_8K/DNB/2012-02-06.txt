Short Hills, NJ  February 6, 2012 - D&B (NYSE: DNB), the world's leading source of commercial information and insight on businesses, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011. The Company also announced its 2012 financial guidance and expected financial flexibility savings.
"Our 2011 results were in line with our expectations and we continue to make progress on our transformation. We are already reaping benefits from our Strategic Technology Initiative, or MaxCV, as we have accelerated the pace of new product innovation and lowered the cost to innovate. This is reflected in our profit and margin expectations for 2012, and we are very pleased with the progress. We
 
 
 
 
did experience a delay in one component of the project, the data supply chain, which will result in a higher program cost and a delay in the final cutover into 2013. We expect revenue growth to continue to accelerate as we complete the project," stated Sara Mathew, D&B's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

was approximately $598 million at the end of 2011, after adjusting for a one-time permanent increase to our 2009 deferred revenue balance of approximately $40 million that rolls forward each year. The adjustment is due to a change in our accounting convention for ratable revenue recognition.
Deferred Revenue
Historically, D&B's accounting convention recognized a full month of revenue for ratable products regardless of the day in the month a contract was signed. This has not had a material impact on our historical revenues and corresponding growth rates in any given year. Going forward, as new products from MaxCV are launched, many of which will be recognized ratably, the timing impact from the current monthly accounting convention may be magnified. Therefore, we are proactively changing our accounting convention to recognize ratable revenue on a daily basis.
On a GAAP basis, the deferred revenue balance is down 3%, primarily due to divestitures in our Asia Pacific segment.
for the full year 2011, excluding the impact of legacy tax matters, was $251.9 million, including approximately $55 million related to the Strategic Technology Investment, compared to $249.2 million in the prior year similar period.The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles. Net cash provided by operating activities for the full year 2011, excluding the impact of legacy tax matters, was $305.3 million, compared to $315.1 million in the prior year similar period. On a GAAP basis, net cash provided by operating activities for the full year 2011 was $312.9 million, compared to $319.4 million in the prior year similar period.

Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded:
 
For the full year 2011, the Company recorded:
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Strategic Technology Investment
In February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. We refer to this program as "MaxCV."
 
 
 
 
 
The most recent estimate was that the project would cost about $130 million and be completed in the second half of 2012. The Company now believes that the total cost will be approximately $160 million and be completed in the second half of 2013. These changes are due to a design feature in the plan for the new data supply chain that will require rework.
For 2012, the project will largely focus on continuing to rebuild the data supply chain as well as introducing additional web services. We expect MaxCV and the associated spending will be largely complete by the end of 2012, however, product and customer migrations are now targeted to be concluded in 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company incurred $12.2 million of total pre-tax operating expenses (or $0.19 per diluted share) on MaxCV, which was included in the non-core gains and charges, and $8.6 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to MaxCV.
For the full year 2011, we incurred $44.8 million of total operating expenses (or $0.69 per diluted share) on MaxCV, which was included in the non-core gains and charges, and $19.2 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to MaxCV.
For the full year 2012, the Company anticipates spending approximately $60 million on MaxCV. We expect approximately 70% of this amount to be operating expenses and 30% to be capital expenditures. The operating expenses will be included in non-core gains and charges.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
2012 Financial Flexibility
D&B continues to create financial flexibility through several reengineering initiatives aimed at greater efficiency and effectiveness, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D&B expects its ongoing financial flexibility initiatives to create $80 million to $90 million of financial flexibility in 2012, before any transition costs and restructuring charges and before any reallocation of savings generated by the initiatives. The Company expects to incur pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $20 million to $25 million associated with its ongoing reengineering efforts, as well as an additional $9 million to $12 million of restructuring costs related to the reorganization of Japan (details of the Japan transaction are described below).
D&B Announces Strategic Transactions
D&B has taken several actions to optimize our global business portfolio, positioning the Company towards higher growth and profitability, as follows:
Reorganization of Japan:
On February 1, 2012, D&B signed a definitive agreement to sell the domestic portion of our Japan operations to Tokyo Shoko Research, LTD. ("TSR"), our local joint venture partner since December 2007. D&B will also enter into commercial arrangements to provide TSR with global data for local Japanese customers and D&B will become the exclusive distributor of TSR data to our Worldwide Network partners.
D&B will receive $4.5 million in net cash consideration as well as $1.5 million to settle a receivable with TSR. Additionally, D&B is entitled to annual payments from TSR under the terms of commercial agreements for data, brand licensing and technology services.
The domestic operations generated approximately $64 million in revenue during 2011. The deal is expected to close on February 29
th
, subject to customary closing conditions.
Strengthens S&MS Portfolio in China:
During the fourth quarter of 2011, we entered into two transactions in China to strengthen our S&MS business, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
In November 2011, D&B acquired substantially all the assets of MicoMarketing, a provider of direct marketing services to B2B customers in China for approximately $14 million. This transaction adds more than 2.5 million business records to our data base and scales our operations in this market. Prior to the acquisition, MicroMarketing generated approximately $11 million of revenue for full-year 2011.
In December 2011, D&B divested its market research business in China, consisting of two joint venture companies, selling our equity shares in such companies to our partner for a total purchase price of $5 million. The business provides highly specialized and customized market information and has little connection to our core data assets.
D&B consolidated approximately $16 million from the joint venture for full-year 2011.
Divested Non-Core Businesses in North America:
Consistent with our MaxCV program, we divested two North American product lines that were sunset earlier in 2011, Purisma and a small supply management consulting business for an aggregate $3 million. These businesses were dependent on a high level of customization making them expensive to maintain and grow.
Combined, these two businesses generated approximately $5 million of revenue during the full-year 2011.
Schedule 7 depicts the effect these divestitures had on our core revenue for 2011, that will be the basis for which we provide 2012 revenue guidance.
Full Year 2012 Guidance
D&B today provided the following financial guidance for the full year 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The impact of MaxCV has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance, which is consistent with our treatment of non-core items.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Cash Dividend Increased
D&B today announced that it has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share, up from D&B's prior quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on March 14, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2012.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2010, filed March 1, 2011 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Teleconference
As previously announced, D&B will review its fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Tuesday,
 
 
 
 
 
February 7, 2012, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio, as well as a replay of the conference call and other related information, will be accessible on D&B's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
