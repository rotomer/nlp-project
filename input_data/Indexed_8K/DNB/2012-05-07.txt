On May 7, 2012, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the first quarter period ended March 31, 2012. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by reference.
 
On May 7, 2012, we issued a press release updating our 2012 full-year financial guidance. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 7.01 by reference.
 
On March 18, 2012, D&B announced we had temporarily suspended our Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co. Ltd. ("Roadway") operations in China, pending an investigation into allegations that certain data collection practices may have violated local Chinese consumer data privacy laws. In addition, we have been reviewing certain allegations that we may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other laws in our China operations. As previously reported, we are cooperating with the local Chinese investigation and have voluntarily reported this matter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice and we are cooperating with both agencies in our investigation.
In connection with the ongoing investigation as well as the time and cost to resolve these issues, we subsequently decided to permanently cease the operations of Roadway and we have begun the process of shutting down that business. However, we remain committed to our growth strategy in China and will continue to operate our other business-to-business Sales & Marketing and Risk Management businesses in that region.
D&B acquired Roadway's operations in 2009 and for full year 2011, Roadway generated approximately $22 million in revenue and $2 million of operating income.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
Short Hills, NJ  May 7, 2012 - D&B (NYSE: DNB), the world's leading source of commercial information and insight on businesses, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
"Our first quarter results were below expectations, due to unexpected weakness in North America and partially offset by strong performance in International. The weakness in North America coupled with the situation in China has necessitated a reduction to our full year revenue and free cash flow guidance. Despite the disappointing top line performance, we are leveraging our flexible business model to ensure we deliver our prior operating margin and EPS commitments. That said, our technology transformation remains on track and once completed, it will become the foundation to drive sustainable top line growth," stated Sara Mathew, D&B's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

The Company ended the first quarter of 2012 with $117.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and total gross debt of $842.8 million.
First Quarter 2012 Segment Results
As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2011, D&B realigned its geographic reporting segments into the following three classifications: i) North America, ii) Asia Pacific and iii) Europe & Other International Markets.
Simultaneously with the sale of the domestic portion of our Japanese operations to Tokyo Shoko Research, LTD. ("TSR"), our local joint venture partner, D&B entered in commercial agreements to provide TSR with global data for local Japanese customers and we became the exclusive distributor of TSR data to our Worldwide Network partners. While we will continue to manage our businesses through these three geographic segments, as of January 1, 2012, our Asia Pacific partnerships were reclassified out of our Europe and Other International Markets into our Asia Pacific segment (which now primarily consists of our operations in Australia, China, India and Asia Pacific Partnerships).
Schedule 7 depicts the effect this reclassification had on our segments for 2011, that is the basis for which we provide 2012 revenue guidance.

Operating income
MaxCV
In February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. We refer to this program as "MaxCV."
In the first quarter of 2012, the Company incurred $8.4 million of total pre-tax expenses (or $0.13 per diluted share) on MaxCV, which is included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $7.5 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to MaxCV.
For the full year 2012, the Company anticipates spending approximately $60 million on MaxCV.
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Update on the Investigation Related to China Operations
On March 18, 2012, D&B announced we had temporarily suspended our Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co. Ltd. ("Roadway") operations in China, pending an investigation into allegations that certain data collection practices may have violated local Chinese consumer data privacy laws. In addition, we have been reviewing certain allegations that we may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other laws in our China operations. As previously reported, we are cooperating with the local Chinese investigation and have voluntarily reported this matter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice and we are cooperating with both agencies in our investigation.
In connection with the ongoing investigation as well as the time and cost to resolve these issues, we subsequently decided to permanently cease the operations of
 
 
 
 
Roadway and we have begun the process of shutting down that business. However, we remain committed to our growth strategy in China and will continue to operate our other business-to-business Sales & Marketing and Risk Management businesses in that region.
D&B acquired Roadway's operations in 2009 and for full year 2011, Roadway generated approximately $22 million in revenue and $2 million of operating income.
Schedule 7 depicts the effect the shut down had on our core revenue for 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, that is the basis for which we provide 2012 revenue guidance.
Non-Core Charges
Related to Matter in China
During the first quarter of 2012, we incurred a $12.9 million impairment charge related to the shut down of Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co. Ltd.
For the full year 2012, we currently expect to incur non-core charges related to the shut down of Shanghai Roadway D&B Marketing Services Co. Ltd., as well as legal, audit and other professional services associated with the investigations in China, that combined equal approximately $25 million. These charges do not include the above impairment charge or any potential regulatory fees or fines associated with our China operations.
 
 
 
 
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded:
 
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2012 Guidance
D&B today revised its financial guidance for the full year 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The impact of MaxCV has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2011, filed February 29, 2012 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
First Quarter 2012 Teleconference
As previously announced, D&B will review its first quarter financial results in a conference call with the investment community on Tuesday, May 8, 2012, at 8 a.m. ET. Live audio as well as a replay of the conference call, will be accessible on D&B's Investor Relations Web site at http://investor.dnb.com.
