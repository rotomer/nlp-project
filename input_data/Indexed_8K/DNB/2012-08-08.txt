Increases Share Repurchase Program to $1 Billion
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $500 million to its existing share repurchase program bringing the total authorization to $1 billion.
As of today, there is $770 million available under the increased authorized program.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Full Year 2012 Guidance
D&B today reaffirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The impact of MaxCV has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
D&B Declares Quarterly Dividend
D&B announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share. This quarterly cash dividend is payable on September 18, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2011, filed February 29, 2012 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
