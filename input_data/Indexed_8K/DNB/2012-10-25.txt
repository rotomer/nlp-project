In February 2010, D&B announced a Strategic Technology Investment program aimed at strengthening its leading position in commercial data and improving its current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers. We refer to this program as "MaxCV."
In the third quarter of 2012, the Company incurred $6.7 million of total pre-tax expenses (or $0.11 per diluted share) on MaxCV, which is included in the Non-Core Gains and Charges noted below, and $6.1 million of capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles related to MaxCV.
For the full year 2012, the Company anticipates spending approximately $60 million on MaxCV.
 
 
 
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional detail.
Non-Core Gains and Charges
During the third quarters of 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded:
 
 
See attached Schedule 3 for additional explanations and details of these charges.
D&B's restructuring charges may be viewed as recurring as they are part of its Financial Flexibility initiatives. In addition to reporting GAAP results, the Company reports results before restructuring charges and other non-core gains and charges because they do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance and they may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of its ongoing business operations. For additional information, see the section titled "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
D&B Announces Changes to Global Leadership Team, Effective January 1, 2013
Mr. Conti joined D&B in June 2003 and has held various roles of increasing responsibility. These positions included: Leader of Corporate Strategy, Vice President of Small Business Solutions in North America, President of Europe, Latin America and Partnerships, Chief Administrative Officer and President, International.
Manny Conti has been named President, North America.
  Mr. Vielehr joined D&B in July 2005 and has held various roles of increasing responsibility. These positions included: Chief Information Officer and Leader, Technology, Chief Quality Officer, President, Integration Solutions, President, Global Risk & Analytics and President, North America.
Byron Vielehr has been named President, International and Global Operations.
 
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2012 Guidance
D&B today reaffirmed its financial guidance for the full year 2012:
 
 
 
 
The impact of MaxCV has been excluded from our operating income and diluted EPS guidance and included in our free cash flow guidance.
D&B does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because D&B is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of non-core gains and charges, such as restructuring charges and legacy tax matters, which are a component of the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-core gains and charges are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to D&B's results computed in accordance with GAAP.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
D&B reports non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and the schedules attached. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  How We Manage Our Business" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2011, filed February 29, 2012 with the SEC, for a discussion of how the Company defines these measures, why it uses them and why it believes they provide useful information to investors. Additionally, these measures are defined in Schedule 3 attached to this press release.
