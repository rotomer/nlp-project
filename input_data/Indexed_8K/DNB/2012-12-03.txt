Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On November 28, 2012 The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to its sale to the Underwriters of $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.250% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 notes") and $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes" and, together with the 2017 notes, the "Senior Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1. The Senior Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-182222) (the "Registration Statement") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The closing of the sale of the Senior Notes occurred on December 3, 2012. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Notes were approximately $741.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. The Company will use the aggregate net proceeds and cash on hand for the repayment of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility which expires on October 25, 2016, and to redeem all of the outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.000% Senior Notes due 2013 on December 31, 2012. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of its current and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under its senior credit facilities, and senior to all of its future subordinated debt. The Indenture (defined below) does not prohibit the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company or its subsidiaries.
The Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of March 14, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2012, between the Company and the Trustee. The First Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. The 2017 notes will mature on December 1, 2017, and the 2022 notes will mature on December 1, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2013. Each interest payment will be made to the persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture, filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 14, 2006, the First Supplemental Indenture, attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto, and the Form of 3.250% Senior Notes due 2017 and Form of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2022 attached as Exhibits 4.2 and 4.3 hereto, respectively.

The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or prevention and, upon such issuance, occurrence or prevention, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or prevention, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its commercially reasonable best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
(b) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, substantially in the form attached as Schedule IV hereto and file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
(c) If there occurs an event or development as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include an untrue statement of a material fact or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented.
(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
(f) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
(g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(h) The Company agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
(i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, during the period from the date of this Agreement through and including the date set forth on Schedule I hereto.
(j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

In addition, the Company shall have requested and caused Shearman & Sterling LLP to have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially to the effect that:
(i) the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder; and no facts came to the attention of such counsel which caused it to believe that on the Effective Date the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date and on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact
 
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case, other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion); and
(ii) no facts came to the attention of such counsel which caused it to believe that the Disclosure Package, as of the time of first sale of the Securities to the public, as assumed therein, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
In rendering such opinion and letter, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion and letter, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
In addition, the Representatives shall have received from Christie A. Hill, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, an opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially to the effect that:
(i) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the law of the State of Delaware;
(ii) all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(iii) the Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus; and
(iv) such counsel does not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries that would be required to be disclosed in the Preliminary Prospectus
 
or the Final Prospectus and is not so disclosed, and such counsel does not know of any documents that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed or of any documents that are required to be summarized in the Preliminary Prospectus and Final Prospectus and are not so summarized.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom such counsel believes to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) shall also include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.
(c) The Representatives shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer or the principal accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package and any supplements or amendments thereto and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice that would prevent its use or the use of the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the Commission; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no change or development that could reasonably be
 
expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(e) The Company shall have requested and caused PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached as Annex B hereto confirming that they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Company, at 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on the Closing Date.
7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which
 
any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting (Conflicts of interest")", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any
 
reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereto. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
Default by an Underwriter
 
, , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
10. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive

Such registration statement, including the prospectus dated June 19, 2012, and the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 28, 2012 is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement."
In connection with the Registration Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations as to the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.

(ii) For the period from October 1, 2012 to October 31, 2012, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated revenues or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur and except that the unaudited consolidated financial data for October 31, 2012 and 2011, which we were furnished by the Company, showed changes in the following:

On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change in capital stock, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur and except as described in the following sentence. We have been informed by officials of the Company that there continues to be an increase in long term debt that is estimated to be approximately $60 million.
 
 
 
However, it should be noted that the Company has not restated its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 to reflect its change in segments, including divested business disclosures.

"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the third business day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series shall adjust if either of Fitch or S&P, or any Substitute Rating Agency (as defined below), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities, in the manner described below.
If the rating of the Securities of this series from Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities shall increase from the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
If the rating of the Securities of this series from S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities shall increase from the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Securities of this series has been adjusted upward and either Fitch or S&P (or either Substitute Rating Agency), as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Securities to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Securities shall decrease such that the interest rate for the Securities equals the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance plus the applicable percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase. If Fitch or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of such Securities to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency increases its rating to BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Securities shall decrease to the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Fitch, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Securities be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Securities, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the senior Securities of that series from another Rating Agency, to the extent one exists, and if another such Rating Agency rates the Securities (such rating agency, a "Substitute Rating Agency"), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Securities pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating of the Securities but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Fitch or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Securities will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Securities on their date of issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table
above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, the interest rate on the Securities shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described herein will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Fitch or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency changes its rating of the Securities more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period shall control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease described herein relating to such agency's action.
If the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series is increased as described herein, the term "interest," as applicable to the Securities, shall be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with
respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No service charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Fitch or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Securities will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Securities on their date of issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Securities, the interest rate on the Securities shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities on the date of their issuance.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described herein will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. If Fitch or S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency changes its rating of the Securities more than once during any particular interest period, the last change by such agency during such period shall control for purposes of any interest rate increase or decrease described herein relating to such agency's action.
If the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series is increased as described herein, the term "interest," as applicable to the Securities, shall be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
This Security shall have the benefit of the covenants and agreements set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the security register, upon surrender of this Security for transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
