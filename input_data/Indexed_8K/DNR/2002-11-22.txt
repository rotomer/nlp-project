ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On November 21, 2002, Denbury Resources Inc. and affiliates of the Texas Pacific Group ("TPG") entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Lehman Brothers Inc., CIBC World Markets Corp., Raymond James and Associates, Inc. and Johnson Rice & Associates, L.L.C. (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which TPG is to sell to the Underwriters an aggregate of 7.0 million shares of Denbury's common stock, with a public offering price of $10.00 per share, which shares represent approximately 25.7% of the shares of Denbury common stock owned by TPG. Additionally, TPG has granted to the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 500,000 shares to cover over-allotments, if any. Denbury will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by TPG and this offering will not affect the number of Denbury shares issued and outstanding. Upon closing, TPG's ownership of Denbury's issued and outstanding common shares will drop from approximately 51% to approximately 38%. Representatives of TPG currently hold four of nine seats on Denbury's board of directors. No immediate plans have been made, nor do any arrangements exist, regarding whether or not representatives of TPG will continue to occupy four board seats. While TPG will have less than 50% of Denbury stock following this offering, they will still be Denbury's largest single stockholder and will still control such a large portion of Denbury stock that their effective control may not be diminished.

Purchase of the Stock by the Underwriters. On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement, each Selling Stockholder hereby agrees to sell the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite its name in Schedule 2 hereto, severally and not jointly, to the several Underwriters and each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite that Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto. Each Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase from each Selling Stockholder that number of shares of the Common Stock which represents the same proportion of the number of shares of the Firm Stock to be sold by each Selling Stockholder, as the number of shares of the Firm Stock set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 represents of the total number of shares of the Firm Stock to be purchased by all of the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement. The respective purchase obligations of the Underwriters with respect to the Firm Stock shall be rounded among the Underwriters to avoid fractional shares, as the Representatives may determine. In addition, the Selling Stockholders specified in Schedule 2 hereto grant to the Underwriters options to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of Option Stock. Such options are granted solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of Firm Stock and are exercisable as provided in Section 5 hereof.

Offering of Stock by the Underwriters. Upon authorization by the Underwriters of the release of the Firm Stock, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Stock for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus. 5. Delivery of and Payment for the Stock. Delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock shall be made at the office of Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 A.M., Houston, Texas time, on the third full business day following the date of this Agreement or at such other date or place as shall be determined by agreement between the Representatives, the Selling Stockholders and the Company. This date and time are sometimes referred to herein as the "FIRST DELIVERY DATE." On the First Delivery Date, the Selling Stockholders shall deliver or cause to be delivered certificates representing the Firm Stock to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Selling Stockholders of the purchase price by wire transfer in immediately available funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Stock shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the First Delivery Date. For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of the certificates for the Firm Stock, the Selling Stockholders shall, or shall cause a custodian to, make the certificates representing the Firm Stock available for inspection by the Representatives in New York, New York, not later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the First Delivery Date. At any time on or before the thirtieth day after the date of this Agreement, the options granted in Section 3 above may be exercised by written notice being given to the Company and the Selling Stockholders by the Representatives. Exercise of these options shall be exercised pro rata among the Selling Stockholders set forth in Schedule 2 hereto as determined by the Representatives.

taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein which consists solely of information set forth in Section 10(f) hereof; and provided further, however that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter in any such case with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact in the Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter (or the action in respect thereof) arises out of a sale by such Underwriter of Stock to a person who was not sent or given, at or prior to the closing of such sale to such person, a copy of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, if the Company had previously furnished (or made available) copies thereof to such Underwriter and the statement or omission in question contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter. (b) Each Selling Stockholders, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (2) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this Section to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon or in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or such Underwriter by such Selling Stockholder directly or through such Selling Stockholder's representatives, specifically for use in the preparation thereof; and shall reimburse each Underwriter, its officers and employees and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, its officers and employees or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Selling Stockholders shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, -24-
liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein which consists solely of the information specified in Section 10(f) hereof and provided, further, that with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Stock, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if copies of the Prospectus were timely delivered to the Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement and a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. However, in no event shall the Selling Stockholder be liable under the provisions of this Section 10 for any amount in excess of the total proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Stock by such Selling Stockholder (after deducting commissions, but before taxes and any other expenses) pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have to any Underwriter or any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter. (c) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and each Selling Stockholder and its officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person if any, who controls the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Securities Act from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Marketing Materials any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company, such Selling Stockholder and any such director, officer or controlling person of the Company or the Selling Stockholder for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, such Selling Stockholder or any such director, officer or controlling person of -25-
the Company or the Selling Stockholder in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, such Selling Stockholder or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person of the Company or the Selling Stockholder. (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 10 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure; and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 10. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Underwriters shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Underwriters and those other Underwriters and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company or any Selling Stockholder under this Section 10 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, it is advisable for the Underwriters, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company or Selling Stockholders. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. -26-
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 10(a), 10(b) or 10(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters shall be obligated to contribute under this Section 10(e) only with respect to losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with the information contained in Section 10(g) or Section 10(f), respectively, hereunder. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the shares of the Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholders or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10(e) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 10(e), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(e), (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged -27-
omission and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the offering of the Stock by such Selling Stockholder (after deducting commissions, but before taxes and any other expenses). No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 10(e) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (f) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Stock by the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of Stock under the caption "Underwriting" in, and the paragraphs addressing the underwriting discount, concessions and reallowances, stabilization, short positions, syndicate transactions and penalty bids appearing under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. 11. Defaulting Underwriters. If, on either Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Stock which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the respective proportions which the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Stock on such Delivery Date if the total number of shares of the Stock which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of shares of the Stock which it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3 hereof. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Delivery Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and the applicable Selling Stockholders to sell, the Option Stock) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Selling Stockholders, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 8 and 13 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, -28-
pursuant to this Section 11, purchases Firm Stock which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase. Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Selling Stockholders for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Stock of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives, the applicable Selling Stockholders or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company, counsel for the Selling Stockholders or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement. 12. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Underwriters by notice given to and received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 9(l) or 9(m) hereof, shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement. 13. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If any Selling Stockholder shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company or any Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company or the Selling Stockholders is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12 hereof by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, neither the Company nor the Selling Stockholders shall be obligated to reimburse any Underwriter on account of those expenses. 14. Notices, etc. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., Syndicate Registration Department, 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022, (Fax: 212-526-0943), with a copy, in the case of any notice pursuant to Section 8(c), to the Director of Litigation, Office of the General Counsel, Lehman Brothers Inc., 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022; (b) if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex, facsimile transmission or recognized overnight delivery service to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Phyl Rykhoek (Fax: (972) 673-2051); and (c) if to any Selling Stockholder, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex, facsimile transmission or recognized overnight delivery service to such Selling Stockholder at the address set forth on Schedule 2 hereto; -29-
provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 10(d) above shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex, facsimile transmission or recognized overnight delivery service to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its acceptance telex to the Underwriters, which address will be supplied to any other party hereto by the Underwriters upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. The Company and the Selling Stockholders shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Underwriters by Lehman Brothers Inc., and the Company and the Underwriters shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Selling Stockholders by a custodian. 15. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Company, the Selling Stockholders and their respective personal representatives and successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company and the Selling Stockholders contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (B) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 10(c) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, directors or general partners of the Selling Stockholders, as the case may be, officers of the Company who have signed the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company or a Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 15, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. 16. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf on them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Stock and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. 17. Definition of the Terms "Business Day" and "Subsidiary." For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "BUSINESS DAY" means any day on which the American Stock Exchange is open for trading and (b) "SUBSIDIARY" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations. 18. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York. 19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 20. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement. -30-
