Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On May 11, 2005, the Board of Directors of Denbury Resources Inc. (the "Company"), approved an amendment to its Director Compensation Plan (the "Director Plan") due to adoption of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 late last year. The Director Plan, adopted July 1, 2000, as amended on February 22, 2001, allows each non-employee director to make an election to receive his or her director's compensation either in cash or in shares of our common stock. The Director Plan was modified to no longer allow directors to defer receipt of their compensation. On the same date, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved a five-year extension of the term of the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan set to expire in August of 2005. Under this plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,750,000 shares of common stock, 1,477,102 of which have been issued to date, with all employees allowed to contribute up to 10% of their base compensation, with the Company matching 75% of the employee contributions. These combined amounts are then used to purchase stock at the end of each fiscal quarter at the current market price for the preceding ten trading days. Employees must hold shares purchased under this plan for a minimum of one year before disposition. For further information regarding the Director Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see the Company's Form 8-K filed with the Commission on April 12, 2005.
