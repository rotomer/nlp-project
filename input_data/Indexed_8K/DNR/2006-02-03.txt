Section 2  Financial Information
 
 
On January 31, 2006, Denbury Resources Inc. (the "Company" or "Denbury") completed its previously announced acquisition of three producing oil properties that are future potential carbon dioxide ("CO2") tertiary oil flood candidates from partnerships affiliated with Merit Energy Company. The assets include controlling interests in three fields: Tinsley Field approximately 40 miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi; Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, and the smaller South Cypress Creek Field near the Company's Eucutta Field in Eastern Mississippi.
 
The preliminary adjusted purchase price is approximately $248 million, after adjusting for interim net cash flow and minor purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded with the $150 million of senior subordinated notes issued in December 2005 and bank financing under the Company's existing credit facility, bringing the currently outstanding balance of the Company's bank debt to approximately $100 million.
 
The acquisition includes an eight inch pipeline (currently being used for natural gas storage) from the Company's Jackson Dome area to Tinsley Field. The Company plans to initially use this pipeline to transport CO2 to the Tinsley Field. The Company anticipates commencing initial tertiary development work at Tinsley Field in 2006 at a preliminarily estimated cost of $19 million, with more extensive development planned for 2007.
 
In order to transport CO2 to Citronelle Field in Alabama, a 60 to 70 mile extension will need to be added to the Company's nearly-completed Free State CO2 pipeline between Jackson Dome and the Company's Eastern Mississippi Eucutta Field. The Company is still reviewing Citronelle Field and has not yet determined a definitive timetable for tertiary development of Citronelle.
 
South Cypress Creek is a small field in Eastern Mississippi and will likely be developed after initial development of the Tinsley and Citronelle fields as an additional project for the Company's Eastern Mississippi Phase II CO2 project.
 
These three fields are currently producing approximately 2,200 BOE/d net to the acquired interests, and have proved reserves of approximately 14.4 million BOEs.

(3)        an amount equal to the sum of any downward adjustments provided elsewhere in this Agreement;
 
(4)        an amount equal to the sum of amounts held in suspense by Seller for the account of third parties (obligations for payment of which amounts to such third parties Buyer shall assume at Closing);

                   at any time that Buyer believes that circumstances with respect to the Bond have changed (such as a sale of a portion of the Assets with Buyer receiving satisfactory replacement security in favor of Seller), Buyer may request that Seller reduce the amount of the Bond.  Seller and Buyer will meet to discuss Buyer's request, and Seller, in its sole discretion, may decide whether or not to reduce the Bond;
(iii)               the Bond may be reduced only if, at the time of the request for reduction, the combined net equity of Buyer equals or exceeds One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000); and

ARTICLE 7. - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
7.1.
         Upon execution of and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right, at reasonable times during normal business hours, to conduct its investigation into the status of the physical and environmental condition of the Assets. If, in the course of conducting such investigation, but subject to Section 7.5, Buyer discovers that any Asset is subject to a material Environmental Defect, Buyer may raise such Environmental Defect in the manner set forth hereafter. For purposes hereof, the term "material" shall mean that the cost of remediating any single defect exceeds $50,000, the parties agreeing that such amount will be a per Asset threshold rather than a deductible. No later than 5:00 p.m., C.S.T., on January 13, 2006 (the "Environmental Defect Notice Date"), Buyer shall notify Seller in writing specifying such Environmental Defects, if any, the Assets affected thereby, and Buyer's good faith detailed calculation of the net reduction in value of the Assets affected by such defects (the "Environmental Defect Value"). Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall treat all information regarding any environmental conditions
 
 
as confidential, whether material or not, and shall not make any contact with any governmental authority or third party regarding same (except to the extent necessary to obtain the records of such parties) without the written consent of the other party unless required by law.
 
7.2.
         If Buyer fails to notify Seller prior to or on the Environmental Defect Notice Date, of any Environmental Defects, all defects will be deemed waived, Seller shall be released from any liability therefor, the Parties shall proceed with Closing, Seller shall be under no obligation to correct the defects, and Buyer shall assume the risks, liability and obligations associated with such defects. Seller may, but shall be under no obligation to, correct at its own cost and expense such defects on or before the Closing Date.
 
7.3.
         Subject to Section 7.4, in the event that Buyer provides Seller with an Environmental Defect Notice, Seller, at its sole option, shall, (i) agree to cure or remediate any Defect within a reasonable time after Closing, (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of the Environmental Defect Value, or (iii) provide Buyer with indemnification for any damages, claims or expenses arising from such Environmental Defect in the form attached as Exhibit G.
 
7.4.
         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to any remedy relating to an alleged Environmental Defect unless and except to the extent that the aggregate cost associated with remedying all alleged Environmental Defects not cured or indemnified against by Seller exceeds Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the "Aggregate Environmental Deductible") and Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with any and all alleged Environmental Defects up to the Aggregate Environmental Deductible. No refund shall be owing with respect to any alleged Environmental Defect for which Seller, at its option, delivers to Buyer an indemnity for such alleged Environmental Defect pursuant to Section 7.3(iii).
 
7.5.
    Buyer acknowledges that prior to the execution of this Agreement it has had a satisfactory and sufficient opportunity to inspect, test and examine the Assets located in Mobile County, Alabama to the full extent of Buyer's requirements and by execution of this Agreement Buyer accepts the Mobile County, Alabama Assets "as is, where is."  Buyer agrees that no condition of any Asset in Mobile County, Alabama shall be considered grounds for an Environmental Defect, and no such condition shall be applied against the Aggregate Environmental Deductible in Section 7.4 or the option to terminate in Article IX.
 
ARTICLE 8. - TITLE DEFECTS AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
For purposes hereof, the terms set forth below shall have the meanings assigned thereto.
 
 
 
 
(a)        "Allocated Value" shall mean the dollar amount allocated to each producing Asset as set forth on Exhibit B.
 
(b)        "Defensible Title", subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances (as hereinafter defined), means, as to the Leases, such title held by Seller and reflected by appropriate documentation properly filed in the official records of the jurisdiction in which the Lease or Leases are located that (i) entitles Seller and will entitle Buyer, after Closing, to own and receive and retain, without suspension, reduction or termination, payment of revenues for not less than the net revenue interest shown on Exhibit B of all oil and gas produced, saved and marketed from or attributable to the well or unit indicated through the plugging, abandonment and salvage of such wells; (ii) obligates Seller, and will obligate Buyer after Closing, to bear the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development and operation of such well or unit through the plugging, abandonment and salvage of such wells in an amount not greater than the expense interest of Seller set forth in Exhibit B (unless Seller's net revenue interest therein is proportionately increased); (iii) the Assets are free and clear of any liens, burdens or encumbrances of any kind or character, and (iv) there are no impairments (including a failure or breach under any agreement or contract) that, in the opinion of a reasonably operator, would materially restrict, impair or extinguish Buyer's right to own an applicable Asset (other than consent requirements, such requirements being addressed in Article 10). "Defensible Title" as to personal property included in the Assets, means title that is free and clear of all material liens, burdens or encumbrances of any kind or character (including, but not limited to claims, demands, damages, liabilities, judgments and causes of action), subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances.
 
(c)        "Title Defect" shall mean any matter which causes Seller to have less than Defensible Title to any of the Assets as of the Closing Date.
 
(d)        "Title Defect Property" shall mean any Lease or Asset or portion thereof burdened by a Title Defect.
 
 
(i)         defects in the early chain of title consisting of failure to recite marital status or the omission of succession or heirship proceedings;
 
(ii)         defects or irregularities arising out of prior oil and gas leases which, on their face, expired more than ten (10) years prior to the Effective Time, and which have not been released of record, and which have not been maintained in force and effect by production or operations pursuant to the terms of such leases;
 
(iii)       tax liens and mechanic's liens for amounts not yet due and payable, or those that are being contested in good faith by Seller in the ordinary course of business;
 
 
 
 
(iv)       to the extent any of the following do not materially diminish the value of, or impair the conduct of operations on, any of the Assets and do not impair Seller's right to receive the revenues attributable thereto: (x) easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other rights in respect of surface operations, pipelines, grazing, hunting, fishing, logging, canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like, and (y) easements for streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, railways and other similar rights-of-way, on, over or in respect of property owned or leased by Seller or over which Seller owns rights of way, easements, permits or licenses;
 
(v)  all lessors' royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried interest, production payments, reversionary interests and other burdens on or deductions from the proceeds of production if the net cumulative effect of such burdens or deductions does not reduce the net revenue interest of Seller in any well affected thereby as reflected in Exhibit B or impair the right to receive revenues attributable thereto;
 
(vi)       preferential rights to purchase and required third party consents to assignments and similar agreements with respect to which waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate parties, or the appropriate time period for asserting the rights has expired without an exercise of the rights prior to the Closing Date;
 
(vii)      all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other actions by governmental entities and tribal authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or interests if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance;
 
(viii)     defects or irregularities of title arising out of events or transactions which have been barred by limitations;
 
(ix)       any encumbrance or other matter having an aggregate adverse effect on the value of the Assets of less than $50,000, the parties agreeing that such amount will be a per Asset threshold rather than a deductible; and
 
(x)        any encumbrance or other matter (whether or not constituting a "Title Defect") expressly waived in writing by Buyer.
 
 
No later than 5:00 p.m., C.S.T., on January 13, 2006 (the "Title Defect Notice Date"), Buyer may provide Seller written notice of any Title Defect (a "Title Defect Notice") along with a description of those matters which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Defects and setting forth in detail Buyer's calculation of the value for each Defect. Seller may elect, at its sole cost and expense, but without obligation, to cure all or any portion of such Defects. Buyer's failure to deliver to Seller such notice on or before the Defect Notice Date shall be deemed a waiver by Buyer of all Defects that Seller does not have notice of
 
 
on such date. Any defect or deficiency concerning Seller's title to the Assets not asserted by Buyer prior to the Title Defect Notice Date shall be deemed waived by Buyer for all purposes (including any Title Defect adjustment to the Purchase Price); provided, however, such waiver shall not effect or impair the warranties of Seller set forth in Section 8.5 or the indemnity obligations of Seller set forth in Section 17.3.
 
 
(a)           Subject to Section 8.6, in the event that Buyer provides Seller with a Title Defect Notice, Seller, at its sole option, shall, (i) agree to cure or remediate any Title Defect in accordance with subparagraph (b) below, (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of the Title Defect Value, or (iii) provide Buyer with indemnification for any damages, claims or expenses arising from such Title Defect.
 
(b)           In the event Seller elects to cure or remediate a Title Defect pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i) above, Closing with respect to the portion of the Assets affected by such Title Defect will be deferred (the "Closing Deferred Property"). Closing with respect to all other Assets will proceed as provided in this Agreement, but the base Purchase Price delivered to Seller at such initial Closing will be reduced by the allocated value of all Closing Deferred Properties. If Seller cures any Title Defect within sixty (60) days after Closing (the "Cure Period"), then the Closing with respect to the Closing Deferred Property for which such Title Defect has been cured will proceed and will be finalized within seven (7) days following the end of the Cure Period. If Seller fails or refuses to cure any Title Defect prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, then Seller shall have the option to either (i) sell the Property to Buyer for an amount equal to the difference between the allocated value and the amount of the Title Defect Value; or (ii) sell the Property to Buyer for an amount equal to the allocated value and provide Buyer with indemnification for any damages, claims or expenses arising from such Title Defect.
 
 
In determining the value of a Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value"), it is the intent of the Parties to include, to the extent possible, only that portion of the lands, leases and wells or other Assets, whether an undivided interest, separate interest or otherwise, materially and adversely affected by the defect. The Title Defect value shall in no event exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset. Subject to such limitation; the Title Defect Value shall be determined by the parties in good faith taking into account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
(i)
         
the Allocated Value of the leases, lands and wells or other Assets affected by the Title Defect;
 
(ii)
         
the reduction in the warranted net revenue interest of the Title Defect Property, or the amount by which the cost sharing percentage for such property is greater than the warranted working interest;
 
 
 
 
(iii)
                        
the productive status of the Title Defect Property (i.e., proved developed producing, etc.) and the present value of the future income expected to be produced therefrom;
 
(iv)
                        
if the Title Defect represents only a possibility of title failure, the probability that such failure will occur;
 
 
(vi)           if the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the leases, lands or wells, the cost of removing such lien or encumbrance.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be contained in this
Article 8
, Buyer understands and agrees that the Allocated Values set forth in
Exhibit B
for a well or unit are for currently producing zones and that any loss of depth rights or acreage associated with such a well or unit will not have a Title Defect Value unless such loss causes a decrease in expense or net revenue interest in the currently producing zone.
 
8.5.
         
Burdens
.
SELLER SHALL CONVEY SELLER'S INTERESTS IN AND TO THE ASSETS TO BUYER SUBJECT TO ALL ROYALTIES, OVERRIDING ROYALTIES, BURDENS, AND ENCUMBRANCES, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF TITLE EXCEPT AS TO ALL PERSONS CLAIMING OR TO CLAIM AN INTEREST IN THE ASSETS BY, THROUGH OR UNDER SELLER BUT NOT OTHERWISE AND NOT AS TO CLAIMS OF FAILURE OR IMPAIRMENT OF TITLE DUE TO GAPS IN PRODUCTION OR A LACK OF PRODUCTION IN PAYING QUANTITIES, AS PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF ASSIGNMENT, BILL OF SALE AND CONVEYANCE ATTACHED AS
EXHIBIT C
HERETO. IMBALANCES WITH RESPECT TO OIL OR NATURAL GAS ARE GOVERNED BY
ARTICLE 18
HEREOF. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH IMBALANCES SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A TITLE DEFECT.
 
8.6.
         
Aggregate Title Deductible
.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to any remedy relating to an alleged Title Defect unless and except to the extent that the aggregate cost associated with remedying all alleged Title Defects not cured or indemnified against by Seller exceeds Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) and Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with any and all alleged Title Defects up to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000). No refund shall be owing with respect to any alleged Title Defect for which Seller, at its option, delivers to Buyer an indemnity for such alleged Title Defect pursuant to Section 8.3.
 
ARTICLE 9. - OPTION TO TERMINATE
 
If the aggregate of the values attributable to all Title Defects determined pursuant to Article 8 plus the value of all Environmental Defects determined pursuant to Article 7 (before reduction pursuant to the application of the deductibles in Sections 7.4 and 8.6 and
 
 
without reduction of such amount by reason of an indemnification by Seller) shall exceed FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ($15 million), either Buyer or Seller may, at its sole option, terminate this Agreement without any further obligation by giving written notice by 12:00 noon Dallas time on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date. In the event of such termination, Seller shall return the Performance Deposit to Buyer, without interest, within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of termination and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability hereunder. Subject to Seller's right to dispute such Title Defect Values and Environmental Defect Values and refer such issue to arbitration pursuant to Section 19.22, the Parties shall use Buyer's good faith estimate of such Defect Values for purposes of this Article 9.
 
ARTICLE 10. - PREFERENTIAL PURCHASE RIGHTS AND CONSENTS
 
 
(a)        Seller and Buyer agree that each shall use all reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all such action as may be necessary to consummate and make effective the transaction provided in this Agreement and to assure that it will not be under any material corporate, legal, or contractual restriction that could prohibit or delay the timely consummation of such transaction.
 
(b)        Promptly after execution of this Agreement, Seller shall notify all holders of (i) preferential rights to purchase the Assets ("Preferential Purchase Rights"), (ii) rights of consent to the assignment of the Assets, or (iii) rights of approval to the assignment of the Assets, and of such terms and conditions of this Agreement to which the holders of such rights are entitled. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any Preferential Purchase Rights are exercised, any consents or approvals denied, or if the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised or consents or approvals having been received. If prior to Closing, any such Preferential Purchase Rights are timely and properly exercised, or Seller is unable to obtain a necessary consent or approval prior to Closing, the interest or part thereof so affected shall be eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such interest or part thereof as provided in Exhibit B. If any additional Preferential Purchase Rights are discovered after Closing, or if a third party Preferential Purchase Rights holder alleges improper notice, then Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in giving effect to any such valid third party Preferential Purchase Rights. In the event any such valid third party Preferential Purchase Rights are validly exercised after Closing, Buyer's sole remedy against Seller shall be return by Seller to Buyer of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated under Exhibit B to the portion of the assets on which such rights are exercised and lost by Buyer to such third party. The parties agree that the Allocated Values for properties subject to Preferential Purchase Rights shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all liability and claims related to the reasonableness of such values.
 
 
 
 
Right has not been asserted prior to Closing and for which the time for election to exercise such Preferential Purchase Right has not expired, Closing with respect to the portion of the Assets subject to such outstanding obligations (the "Third Party Interests") will occur as scheduled and Buyer shall take the Third Party Interests subject to any such remaining Preferential Purchase Rights and shall indemnify Seller for any losses incurred by Seller in connection therewith.
 
(d)
      
In the event that the applicable Transfer Requirement with respect to any of the Assets has not been waived, complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall hold title to the Asset(s) affected by such unresolved Transfer Requirement for the benefit of Buyer, and Buyer shall be entitled to all benefits and shall bear all liabilities, costs and expenses associated the or related to such Assets, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller in relation to such Assets to the full extent applicable to Assets conveyed to Buyer under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. For purposes of this Article 10, "Transfer Requirement" means any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any person which is required to be obtained, made or complied with for or in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or encumbrance of any Asset or any interest therein, other than any consent of, notice to, filing with, or other action by governmental bodies in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and/or gas leases or interests therein, or surface contracts or interests therein, if they are not required prior to the assignment of such oil and/or gas leases, surface contracts or interests or they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance (including consents from the Bureau of Land Management or state agencies).
 
 
ARTICLE 11. - COVENANTS OF SELLER
 
 
(a)        From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and until the Closing, and subject to Section 11.2 and the constraints of applicable operating and other agreements, Seller shall operate, manage, and administer the Assets as a reasonable and prudent operator and in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with its past practices, and shall carry on its business with respect to the Assets in substantially the same manner as before execution of this Agreement. Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to preserve in full force and effect all Leases, operating agreements, easements, rights-of-way, permits, licenses, and agreements which relate to the Assets in which Seller owns an interest, and shall perform all obligations of Seller in or under all such agreements relating to the Assets; provided, however, Buyer's sole remedy for Seller's breach of its obligations under this Section 11.1(a) shall be limited to the amount of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated in Exhibit B to that portion of the Assets affected by such breach. Seller
 
 
With respect to emergency actions taken by Seller in the face of serious risk to life, property, or the environment, without prior approval of Buyer pursuant to the provisions above, Seller will advise Buyer of its actions as promptly as reasonably possible and consult with Buyer as to any further related actions.
shall, except for emergency action taken in the face of serious risk to life, property, or the environment (1) submit to Buyer, for prior written approval, all requests for operating or capital expenditures and all proposed contracts and agreements relating to the Assets which involve individual commitments of more than $50,000; (2) consult with, inform, and advise Buyer regarding all material matters concerning the operation, management, and administration of the Assets, including providing Buyer with weekly reports on production numbers upon request by Buyer; (3) obtain Buyer's written approval prior to voting under any operating, unit, joint venture, partnership or similar agreement; and (4) not approve or elect to go nonconsent as to any proposed well or plug and abandon or agree to plug and abandon any well without Buyer's prior written approval. On any matter requiring Buyer's approval under this Section 11.1(a), Buyer shall respond within five (5) days to Seller's request for approval and failure of Buyer to respond to Seller's request for approval within such time shall release Seller from the obligation to obtain Buyer's approval before proceeding on such matter.
 
(b)        Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any suit, lessor demand action, or other proceeding before any court, arbitrator, or governmental agency and any cause of action which relates to the Assets or which might result in impairment or loss of Seller's interest in any portion of the Assets or which might hinder or impede the operation of the Assets.
 
 
 
To the extent Seller is not the operator of any of the Assets, the obligations of Seller in Section 11.1 concerning operations or activities which normally or pursuant to existing contracts are carried out or performed by the operator, shall be construed to require only that Seller use all reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of such Assets to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.

"Casualty Loss" and limited to property damage or taking only), Buyer and Seller must agree prior to Closing either (i) to delete that portion of the Assets which is subject to the Casualty Loss from the Assets, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the value allocated to the deleted interest as set out in Exhibit B, or (ii) for Buyer to proceed with the purchase of such Assets, notwithstanding any such destruction or taking (without reduction of the Purchase Price) in which case Seller shall pay, at the Closing, to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by third parties by reason of the destruction or taking of such Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all insurance proceeds received by Seller as well as all of the right, title and interest of Seller in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from third parties arising out of such destruction or taking; provided, however, if the value of that portion of the Assets affected by the Casualty Loss, not to exceed that allocated in Exhibit B, exceeds $15,000,000, Buyer and Seller shall each have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notification to the other, the transaction shall not close and thereafter neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any liability or further obligations to the other hereunder. In the event of such termination, Seller shall return the Performance Deposit to Buyer, without interest, within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of termination and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability hereunder. Prior to Closing, Seller shall not voluntarily compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable by reason of any Casualty Loss without first obtaining the written consent of Buyer.
 
ARTICLE 16. - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
 
 
 
If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement does not close because (a) a condition to Buyer's obligation to close, as set forth in Section 12.2, is not satisfied, or because (b) Buyer terminates this Agreement under the provisions of Articles 9 or 15, or as elsewhere provided for and allowed in this Agreement, unless Buyer chooses the remedy of specific performance, if applicable, as set forth in Section 16.2, Seller will refund the Performance Deposit to Buyer, without interest, within five (5) days following the later of the Closing Date or any extension thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.If for any reason other than those set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, Buyer fails, refuses or is unable to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement on or before the Closing Date, as it may be extended in accordance herewith,

Upon failure of Seller to comply herewith by the Closing Date, as it may be extended in accordance herewith, Buyer, at its sole option and in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or equity, may (i) enforce specific performance, or (ii) terminate this Agreement. In the event Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement as set forth above, Seller shall immediately return the Performance Deposit to Buyer.
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of this Agreement shall not prejudice or impair Buyer's obligations under Section 6.3 and 6.4 (and the confidentiality and indemnity agreements referenced therein).

ARTICLE 18. - GAS IMBALANCES
 
Seller and Buyer will use their best efforts to update (to the Effective Time) the gas imbalance volume amounts listed on
Exhibit F
. If, prior to the Final Settlement Date, either party hereto notifies the other party hereto that the volumes set forth in

ARTICLE 19. - MISCELLANEOUS
 
 
The parties hereto agree that prior to Closing, prior to making any public announcement or statement with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the party desiring to make such public announcement or statement shall consult with the other party hereto and exercise its best efforts to (i) agree upon the text of a joint public announcement or statement to be made by both of such parties; or (ii) obtain written approval of the other party hereto to the text of a public announcement or statement to be made solely by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to require either party to obtain approval of the other party hereto to disclose information with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to any state or federal governmental authority or agency to the extent (i) required by applicable law or by any applicable rules, regulations or orders of any governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction; or (ii) necessary to comply with
 
 
disclosure requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or other recognized exchange or over the counter, and applicable securities laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that neither Buyer nor Seller shall make any public announcement until Buyer has delivered the Performance Deposit to Seller.
 
 
Buyer shall be solely responsible for all filings and recording of assignments and other documents related to the Assets and for all fees connected therewith, and Buyer shall furnish copies of all such filed and/or recorded documents to Seller. Seller shall not be responsible for any loss to Buyer because of Buyer's failure to file or record documents correctly or promptly. Buyer shall promptly file all appropriate forms, declarations or bonds with federal and state agencies relative to its assumption of operations and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with such filings.
 
 
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event Exhibit A incorrectly or insufficiently describes or references or omits the description of a property or interest intended to be conveyed hereby as described in Sections 1.12 or 1.14, Seller agrees to, within a reasonable time after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written request, together with supporting documentation satisfactory to Seller, correct such Exhibit and/or execute an amended assignment or other appropriate instruments necessary to transfer the property or interest intended to be conveyed hereby to Buyer.
(a)        After the Closing each of the parties will execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other such further instruments, and take such other action, as may be reasonably requested in order to more effectively assure to said party all of the respective properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, and privileges intended to be assigned, delivered or inuring to the benefit of such party in consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(b)        Buyer agrees to maintain the files and records of Seller that are acquired pursuant to this Agreement for seven (7) years after Closing. Buyer shall provide Seller and its representatives reasonable access to and the right to copy such files and records for the purposes of (i) preparing and delivering any accounting provided for under this Agreement and adjusting, prorating and settling the charges and credits provided for in this Agreement; (ii) complying with any law, rule or regulation affecting Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date; (iii) preparing any audit of the books and records of any third party relating to Seller's interest in the Assets prior to the Closing Date, or responding to any audit prepared by such third parties; (iv) preparing tax returns; (v) responding to or disputing any tax audit; or (vi) asserting, defending or otherwise dealing with any claim or dispute under this Agreement.
 
(c)        Buyer agrees that within thirty (30) days after Closing or within thirty (30) days after operations are actually transferred, whichever is later, it will remove or cause to be removed the names and marks used by Seller and all variations and derivatives thereof
 
 
and logos relating thereto from the Assets and will not thereafter make any use whatsoever of such names, marks and logos.
 
(d)        To the extent not obtained or satisfied as of Closing, Seller agrees to continue to use all reasonable efforts, but without any obligation to incur any cost or expense in connection therewith, and to cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain for Buyer (i) access to files, records and data relating to the Assets in the possession of third parties; and (ii) access to wells constituting a part of the Assets operated by third parties for purposes of inspecting same.
 
(e)        Buyer shall comply with all current and subsequently amended applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations applicable to the Assets and shall promptly obtain and maintain all permits required by governmental authorities in connection with the Assets.
 
Buyer shall be under no obligation to collect on behalf of Seller any receivables or other funds included in the Excluded Assets.
(f)        Notwithstanding anything in this Section 19.3 to the contrary,
 
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and any communication or delivery hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given and received when actually delivered to the address of the parties to be notified as set forth below and addressed as follows:
 
If to Seller, as follows:
 
 
 
If to Buyer:
 
5100 Tennyson Parkway, Suite 3000
Plano, TX 75024
Attention:Ray Dubuisson
 
 
Provided, however, that any notice required or permitted under this Agreement will be effective if given verbally within the time provided, so long as such verbal notice is followed by written notice thereof in the manner provided herein within twenty-four (24) hours
 
 
following the end of such time period. Any party may, by written notice so delivered to the other, change the address to which delivery shall thereafter be made.
 
 
Buyer shall bear and pay (i) all state or local government sales, transfer, gross proceeds, or similar taxes incident to or caused by the transfer of the Assets to Buyer, (ii) all documentary, transfer and other state and local government taxes incident to the transfer of the Assets to Buyer; and (iii) all filing, recording or registration fees for any assignment or conveyance delivered hereunder. Each party shall bear its own respective expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and Closing of this transaction, including it own consultants' fees, attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, and other similar costs and expenses.
 
 
Any of the terms, provisions, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party waiving compliance. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect such party's right to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition, or of the breach of any term, provision, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of any other term, provision, covenant, representation or warranty.
 
 
All the terms, provisions, covenants, obligations, indemnities, representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The rights and obligations of each party under this Agreement to indemnify and be indemnified are personal to that party and may not be assigned or transferred to any other party, firm, corporation or other entity, without the prior, express and written consent of the other party, and such consent may be withheld for any reason, including convenience. Any attempt to assign this Agreement as it relates to obligations to indemnify the other party over the objection or without the express written consent of the other party shall be absolutely void. Seller may condition its consent to assign such indemnification obligations on Buyer providing Seller with an appropriate guarantee of its assignee's performance. This paragraph is not intended to restrict Buyer's ability to assign the Assets or any portion thereof after Closing without the consent of Seller, but in the event Buyer sells or assigns all or a portion of the Assets, the indemnity obligations under this Agreement shall remain in effect between Buyer and Seller as to all the Assets regardless of such assignment.
 
 
 
 
 
(a)        Seller and Buyer agree that this transaction is not subject to the reporting requirement of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and that, therefore, IRS Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement, is not required to be and will not be filed for this transaction. In the event the parties mutually agree that a filing of Form 8594 is required, the parties will confer and cooperate in the preparation and filing of their respective forms to reflect a consistent reporting of the agreed upon allocation.
 
(b)        Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay all taxes attributable to or arising from the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay all taxes attributable to or arising from the ownership or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time. Any party which pays such taxes for the other party shall be entitled to prompt reimbursement upon evidence of such payment. Each party shall be responsible for its own federal income taxes, if any, as may result from this transaction.
 
(c)        If this transaction is determined to result in state sales or transfer taxes, Buyer shall be solely responsible for any and all such taxes due on the Assets acquired by Buyer by virtue of this transaction. If Buyer is assessed such taxes, Buyer shall promptly remit same to the taxing authority. If Seller is assessed such taxes, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any such taxes paid by Seller to the taxing authority.
 
 
This Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof, including the Purchase Price, shall be maintained confidential by Buyer and Seller until Closing; provided, however, that this Agreement and the terms and provisions thereof may be disclosed to Buyer's lenders, if any, and their consultants and representatives, who shall be required to keep such information confidential.
 
 
It is expressly understood and agreed that Seller retains its right to receive its proportionate share of the proceeds (net of a proportionate share of any reasonable audit expenses) from any audits relating to activities prior to the Effective Time, and Seller shall likewise assume and pay (or reimburse Buyer, as applicable) for Seller's share of liabilities resulting from any such audits attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 17.3; provided, however, that this provision is intended to clarify, rather than alter the parties liabilities as allocated pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.
 
 
Each party consents to the other party's assignment of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to its Qualified Intermediary (as that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-l(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) in connection with effectuation of a like-kind exchange. However, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment of
 
 
this Agreement to a Qualified Intermediary does not release either party from any of their respective liabilities and obligations to each other under this Agreement. Each party agrees to cooperate with the other to attempt to structure the transaction as a like-kind exchange.
 
 
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OTHERWISE APPLICABLE TO SUCH DETERMINATIONS. ANY ACTION PERMITTED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO BE COMMENCED IN COURT SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY IN STATE COURT LOCATED IN COLLIN COUNTY, TEXAS, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY HAVE TO SUCH VENUE OR FORUM.
 
 
This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between the Parties and replaces and supersedes all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings related to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral. No other agreement, statement, or promise made by any party, or to any employee, officer or agent of any party, which is not contained in this Agreement shall be binding or valid. This Agreement may be supplemented, altered, amended, modified or revoked by writing only, signed by the Parties hereto. The headings herein are for convenience only and shall have no significance in the interpretation hereof. The Parties stipulate and agree that this Agreement shall be deemed and considered for all purposes, as prepared through the joint efforts of the Parties, and shall not be construed against one party or the other as a result of the preparation, submittal or other event of negotiation, drafting or execution thereof. It is understood and agreed that there shall be no third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and that the provisions hereof do not impart enforceable rights in anyone who is not a party or a successor or assignee of a party hereto.
 
 
 
If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and if it cannot be so modified, it shall be deemed deleted and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue and remain in full force and effect.
 
 
 
All Exhibits attached to this Agreement, and the terms of those Exhibits which are referred to in this Agreement, are made a part hereof and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Assets set out in Section 1.14(d) shall be provided by Seller to Buyer as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date at a location to be specified by Seller. Any transportation, postage, or delivery costs from Seller's offices shall be at Buyer's sole cost, risk and expense.
 
 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all of the representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and agreements of or by the parties hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of the Assignment and Conveyance indefinitely.
 
 
Regardless of the date set for the Final Settlement, Buyer and Seller agree that their intent is to allow for the earliest practical forwarding of revenue and reimbursement of expenses between them, and Seller and Buyer recognize that either may receive funds or pay expenses after the Final Settlement Date which are properly the property or obligation of the other. Therefore, upon receipt of net proceeds or payment of net expenses due to or payable by the other party hereto, whichever occurs first, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall submit a statement to the other party hereto showing the relevant items of income and expense. Payment of any net amount due by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, on the basis thereof shall be made within ten days of receipt of the statement.
 
 
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each and every counterpart shall be deemed for all purposes one (1) agreement.
 
 
Seller makes no representation as to Buyer's ability to be appointed operator of any of the Assets.
 
 
(a)Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation any dispute as to the construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability or breach of this Agreement, shall be exclusively and finally settled by arbitration in accordance with this Section 19.22. Any Party may submit such a dispute, controversy or claim to arbitration by notice (the "Arbitration Notice") to the other Party.
        
 
 
 
 
(b)The arbitration shall be heard and determined by one arbitrator agreed to by the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator within ten (10) days after receipt of the Arbitration Notice by the last Party to receive such Notice, then the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") shall submit to the Parties a list of arbitrators who are knowledgeable experts in the oil and gas industry. Sellers (acting collectively) and Buyer shall each rank the arbitrators on the AAA list and shall submit such ranking to the AAA within ten (10) days after receipt of the AAA list. The AAA shall select the arbitrator with the highest ranking on both the Sellers' and Buyer's ranking lists. The AAA shall disqualify any arbitrator if the AAA determines that such arbitrator has a financial interest in the outcome of the dispute, controversy or claim or has any business, social or family relationship with any of the Parties or is otherwise not disinterested.
        
 
(c)Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Parties to the arbitration proceedings:
        
 
 
(2)
            
The sole arbitrator shall be and remain at all times wholly independent and impartial;
 
(3)The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as amended from time to time;
        
 
(4)Any procedural issues not determined under the AAA arbitral rules shall be determined by the arbitration act and any other applicable laws of the State of Texas, other than those laws which would refer the matter to another jurisdiction;
        
 
(5)
            
The costs of the arbitration proceedings (including attorneys' fees and costs) shall be borne in the manner determined by the sole arbitrator;
 
(6)
            
The decision of the sole arbitrator shall be (i) reduced to writing; (ii) final and binding without the right of appeal; (iii) the sole and exclusive remedy regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented to the arbitrator; (iv) made and promptly paid in U.S. dollars free of any deduction or offset; and (v) issued to require to the maximum extent permitted by law that any costs or expenses incident to enforcing the award be charged against the Party resisting such enforcement;
 
(7)
            
Consequential, punitive or other similar damages shall not be allowed except those payable to third parties for which liability is allocated among the Parties by the arbitral award;
 
(8)The award shall include interest from the date of any breach or violation of this Agreement, as determined by the arbitral award, and from the date of the award until paid in full, at the prime rate in effect at Bank of America, Houston, Texas, (or any successor thereto) plus 2%;
        
 
 
 
 
9)Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the person or the assets of the Party owing the judgment or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be;
         
 
(10)The arbitration shall proceed in the absence of a Party who, after due notice, fails to answer or appear. An award shall not be made solely on the default of a Party, but the arbitrator(s) shall require the Party who is present to submit such evidence as the arbitrator(s) may determine is reasonably required to make an award; and
      
 
(11)If the arbitrator should die, withdraw or otherwise become incapable of serving, or refuse to serve, a successor arbitrator shall be selected and appointed in the same manner as the original arbitrator.
      
 
(12)
                 
The referral of any issue to arbitration under this Section 19.22 shall not, in and of itself, result in a delay of Closing unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.
 
 
those full time and part time field employees (hourly and salaried) of Seller, who currently perform substantially all of their services with respect to the Assets, as identified by Seller within thirty (30) Business Days after execution of this Agreement, but prior to the Closing Date ("For purposes of this Agreement, a "Transferred Employee" is a Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to this Section 19.23(a).
(a)        Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer may make an offer of employment to
Business Employees").
 
(b)f within the six (6) month period commencing on the Closing Date a Transferred Employee incurs an "Involuntary Termination of Employment," Buyer shall pay Seller a Severance Amount with respect to such terminated Transferred Employee. For purposes of this Section 19.23(b), the term "Involuntary Termination of Employment" means the termination of the Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer (i) by Buyer or one of its affiliates without "Cause" or (ii) by the Transferred Employee for "Good Reason." For purposes of this Section 19.23(b), the term "Cause" means (i) the willful and continued failure by the Transferred Employee to perform his or her duties, or (ii) the willful engaging of the Transferred Employee in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to Buyer. For purposes of this Section 19.23(b), the term "Good Reason" means (i) the assignment to the Transferred Employee of any duties or responsibilities that are substantially diminished as compared to the Transferred Employee's duties as of date of
        Buyer agrees to pay Seller at Closing an amount equal to the sum of (i) four (4) months salary/wages, and (ii) four (4) months COBRA premiums, with respect to each Business Employee who does not constitute a Transferred Employee pursuant to Section 19.23 (as computed with respect to each Business Employee, a "Severance Amount,"). In addition, i
 
 
hire by Buyer, (ii) a reduction in the amount of the Transferred Employee's aggregate annualized salary, or hourly base rate of pay, as applicable, plus the individual's target cash bonus opportunity below the amount of the Transferred Employee's aggregate annualized salary, or hourly base rate of pay, as applicable, plus the individual's target cash bonus opportunity with Seller as of date of hire by Buyer, or (iii) the relocation of the Transferred Employee's principal place of employment would require an increase of more than 50 miles in his commute from his residence to his principal place of employment.
 
(c)With respect to events following the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for sending timely and appropriate notices to all Transferred Employees required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and all other applicable laws relating to plant or facility closings or otherwise regulating the termination of employees. To the extent that any liability is incurred under any such laws based on Buyer's actions after the Closing, Buyer shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all obligations and liabilities incurred under WARN and other such laws relating to this transaction.
