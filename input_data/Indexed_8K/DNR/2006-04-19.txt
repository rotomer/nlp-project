Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On April 19, 2006, the Denbury Resources Inc. filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 that contained the following disclosures regarding preliminary estimates of selected available operational and financial information for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, that were previously non-public information:
Based on preliminary estimates, the Company's production for the first quarter of 2006 is expected to be between 35,000 to 36,000 BOE/d. Production by area is expected to be approximately 12,400 BOE/d from the non-CO2 floods in Mississippi, 9,750 BOE/d from CO2 floods, 8,350 BOE/d from Louisiana, 4,000 BOE/d from the Barnett Shale, and approximately 1,000 BOE/d from Alabama, in each case plus or minus up to 250 BOE/d. First quarter preliminary estimates include two months of production from the three properties acquired in late January 2006, production from which is estimated to contribute approximately 1,400 BOE/d to estimated total first quarter production.
Each fiscal quarter we charge to earnings any changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts. We preliminarily estimate that this non-cash charge for the first quarter of 2006 will be approximately $10.9 million; for the quarter we also will record for the first time a non-cash charge to earnings estimated to be up to $3.0 million to reflect the adoption on January 1, 2006 of SFAS No. 123(R) related to compensation expense for share-based compensation.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
