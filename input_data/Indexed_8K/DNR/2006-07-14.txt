Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
 
On July 14, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in the base salary for all executive officers  (7 individuals) of Denbury effective August
 
1, 2006.   This percentage increase in officer base salaries matches the 5% raise in base salaries given to all other Company employees effective July 1, 2006.    The Company's Board of Directors considers these salary increases necessary in order to keep the Company's compensation competitive with that of its industry peers and to better retain its officers and employees given the continued high activity levels in the oil and gas exploration and production industry and accompanying intense competition for personnel.
