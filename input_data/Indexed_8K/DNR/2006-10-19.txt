Exhibit 99.1
News Release Released at 7:30 a.m. CDT
     DALLAS  October 19, 2006  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") announced the following items:
Operations Update
     Based on preliminary data, the Company anticipates that its third quarter 2006 total production will be about the same as production in the second quarter of 2006, which averaged 37,474 BOE/d, more than 35% higher than the average production during the third quarter of 2005, a quarter that was negatively affected by hurricanes. Preliminary indications are that modest increases in Barnett Shale and Eastern Mississippi production levels were almost equally offset by slight decreases in Louisiana natural gas production and temporary delays in tertiary oil production.
     In Louisiana, the Westervelt No. 2 well drilled in the Company's Gumbo prospect in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana has been completed and is currently producing at a gross rate of approximately 13.8 MMcf/d and 580 Bbls/d. This rate is lower than the initial gross rate of over 21 MMcf/d and 810 Bbls/d produced approximately a month earlier. Production and associated flowing tubing pressure declines are greater than initially anticipated and likely indicates substantially lower proved reserves than the originally estimated two million net BOE in the immediate area around the well. The Company's net revenue interest is approximately 29% in this well. The Company remains optimistic about the potential of the prospect area and has spudded a second well which is expected to yield results in the first quarter of 2007.
     Production from the Company's currently producing tertiary properties in Southwest Mississippi is expected to be slightly less than the 10,376 BOE/d the Company reported in the second quarter of 2006. These temporary fluctuations in production do not indicate any issue with the proved and potential oil reserves recoverable with CO because the correlation between oil production and CO injections remains high. The lag in production is due to a series of various delays in obtaining equipment or completing facilities causing the Company's CO injections to be below forecasted amounts. The Company is currently reviewing the impact such delays have on its forecasts and plans to update such forecasts before its analyst meeting in November.

     Total Jackson Dome CO production is estimated to average about 350 MMcf/d in the third quarter of 2006. Although potential production capacity is over 500 MMcf/d, the ability to produce these volumes and transport it to the Company's CO floods has been constrained awaiting completion of additional drying capacity and associated pipeline infrastructure. The Company expects its new Barksdale drying plant and associated in-field pipelines to be completed by December, delayed from the original target of July 2006. This drying plant will add 300 MMcf/d of drying capacity which should give the Company significant spare drying capacity and the new pipelines will give the Company increased flexibility in being able to direct and adjust the flow of CO to various oil fields.

     In East Mississippi the Company's Phase 2 construction of recycling facilities at Soso, Eucutta and Martinville is almost complete and they should be fully operational in the next month, with oil production expected to commence in the near future.
