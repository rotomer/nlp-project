Section 8  Other Events
 
 
This week the Company
has entered into natural gas derivative swaps for 2007 designed to mitigate a portion of the price volatility risk associated with its forecasted 2007 natural gas production. Denbury has swapped in a forward sale, on an initial no-cash-cost basis, a total of 75 MMcf/day of natural gas for the calendar year at prices ranging from $7.95 to $7.99 per MMBtu. This represents approximately 90% of the Company's currently forecasted natural gas production for 2007. The value of these derivative contracts will be marked -to-market at the end of each fiscal quarter as the Company does not use hedge accounting to record its derivative contracts
