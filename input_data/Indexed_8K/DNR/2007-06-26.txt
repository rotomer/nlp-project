EXHIBIT 99.1
News Release Released at 8:00 a.m. CDT
DALLAS  June 25, 2007 Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced that is has entered into an agreement with Rentech Inc. (AMEX:RTK) to purchase all of the CO captured from a planned synthetic fuel plant to be built in Natchez, Mississippi, which is scheduled to commence operations in the next four to five years. Denbury is expected to purchase between 350 MMcf/d and 400 MMcf/d of captured CO from Rentech, a by-product of this proposed plant's anticipated production of 25,000 Bbs/d of clean synthetic diesel fuel. The base purchase price of this COis currently expected to be slightly higher than the base price of COfrom the Company's two other contracted synthetic sources (at today's oil price), but the higher base price for COfrom this plant is expected to be offset by a higher percentage of future potential carbon emissions credits generated by this sequestration process.

The Company has previously signed CO purchase contracts for two other planned gasification plants proposed by Faustina Hydrogen Products LLC, one expected to be built near Donaldsonville, Louisiana and another planned for construction near Beaumont, Louisiana. If all three plants are built, these synthetic sources will provide the Company with an aggregate of 750 MMcf/d to 850 MMcf/d of CO by 2012. The base price of CO from all of these synthetic sources is currently expected to be 1.5 to 2.0 times higher than the Company's most recent all-in cost for its CO from natural sources (calculated based upon today's oil prices and roughly equivalent pressures). These predicted synthetic CO prices are expected to be competitive with prices for CO from Denbury's natural sources after adjusting for the Company's share of carbon emissions credits using estimated current prices of CO carbon credit futures. The Company plans to connect these manufactured sources of COto the Company's natural source of COwhich will allow the Company to allocate production as required between the two sources.

Gareth Roberts, CEO of Denbury, commented on the transaction, saying: "We plan to use the CO produced from this proposed plant to further expand our tertiary operations in the Gulf Coast area. By injecting this CO, a by-product of the proposed plant, into mature oil fields, we not only help to protect the environment by reducing greenhouse gases, but also produce additional oil to help reduce our nation's need for imported oil."

This press release, other than historical financial information, contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to proposed gasification plants and anticipated COproduction levels therefrom as detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. These reports are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. These statements are based on assumptions concerning commodity prices, existing market conditions, scheduling, engineering assumptions, anticipated legislation and assumptions regarding carbon credit futures market that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and the Company's future performance are both subject to a wide range of business risks, and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Actual results may vary materially.
