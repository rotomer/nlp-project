Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 19, 2008, the principal wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR), Denbury Onshore, LLC, entered into an agreement with a privately-owned company, Wapiti Energy, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Wapiti Operating, LLC and Wapiti Gathering, LLC to purchase a 91.4% working interest (approximate net revenue interest of 77.6%) in Conroe Field, an oil field with oil reserves that have the potential to be extracted using Carbon Dioxide for tertiary flooding. The Company will succeed the seller as operator of the field.
The primary assets are north of Houston, Texas. The transaction is expected to close in October 2008, subject to our due diligence and other conditions to closing customary for transactions of this type. The acquisition price is $600 million and is subject to adjustment at the closing date or during the subsequent 36 months if oil futures prices exceed $121 per barrel (the "Base Price") as follows:
On August 20, 2008, we transferred to the seller $30 million as a performance deposit which will be credited to the purchase price at closing. If the conditions to closing are satisfied and the acquisition is not consummated by October 1, 2008 due to our failure to perform our material obligations, then we will forfeit the performance deposit.
We plan to fund the acquisition initially with bank debt, which will require an anticipated increase in our bank credit line. Currently our borrowing base under our credit agreement is $1.0 billion with the commitment amount set at $350 million. The borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint based on our assets, as confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. The banks have the option to participate in any borrowing
 
request by us in excess of the commitment amount, up to the borrowing base limit, although the banks are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of the commitment amount. We intend to follow up with other sources of funds including possibly other debt financing or the sale of our Barnett Shale properties in North Texas.
We plan to build an eighty mile pipeline to transport to the Conroe Field the COto be used for tertiary flooding. For more details on our expected expenditures to extract oil from the Conroe Field, see the attached press release.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release Released at 7:30 a.m. CDT
     DALLAS  August 21, 2008  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") announced today that it has entered into an agreement with a privately-owned company to purchase a 91.4% interest in Conroe Field, a significant potential tertiary flood north of Houston, Texas, for $600 million, plus additional potential consideration if oil prices exceed $121 per barrel during the next three years as further discussed below. Closing is expected in early October 2008 and is subject to normal title, environmental and other due diligence. The Company plans to temporarily fund the acquisition with bank debt by seeking an increase in its bank credit line, but intends to ultimately seek more permanent financing which may include other debt financing or the sale of its Barnett Shale properties in North Texas.
Highlights of Purchase Agreement
 
Update on CO
2
Sources
     The Company is continuing to pursue additional sources of CO, particularly anthropogenic (man-made) sources in the Gulf Coast and in other areas that could be connected to our CO pipeline infrastructure. In this regard, to date the Company has signed three CO offtake agreements to purchase CO from proposed gasification projects, which if constructed could deliver as much as 800 MMcf/d of CO. In addition to these three CO offtake contracts, the Company has signed an additional seven Letters of Intent ("LOI") for additional proposed gasification projects. The potential volume of CO from these seven projects would bring the Company's total potential anthropogenic CO, volumes, including potential volumes under the three existing contracts, to approximately 2.5 Bcf/d. The Company has typically entered into LOIs for proposed projects during the development stage and then has negotiated CO offtake agreements before a project enters into the financing phase. The Company is currently negotiating offtake agreements for five of the seven projects under LOIs, and thus would expect to enter into additional CO offtake agreements in the near future. The five projects currently under negotiation have a combined 1.2 Bcf/d of additional potential CO volumes, which would more than double the Company's currently contracted volumes of anthropogenic CO. While it is likely that less than all of the proposed projects will actually be constructed, the Company continues to believe that a sufficient number of the projects will be built (or additional projects will be developed) to provide CO volumes matching or exceeding its estimated deliverability from Jackson Dome.

     In addition to the Company's efforts focused on potential gasification projects, the Company has begun discussions pertaining to several existing facilities that are presently emitting CO. The majority of these projects have substantially lesser volumes (20 to 40 MMcf/d) than the proposed gasification projects, but these existing facilities are all located in close proximity to the Company's Green Pipeline. Thus, addition of these sources could be accomplished without construction of significant pipeline laterals. CO from these existing sources could be captured and transported through the Green Pipeline in approximately one-half the time that it will take to construct the proposed gasification projects.

     Finally, the Company is in the final stages of completing its 136 square mile 3D survey in the Jackson Dome area to potentially identify the location of additional volumes of natural CO. At this time, the Company does not have any additional information other than the geological leads that led the Company to conduct the seismic survey. All but one of eleven structures in the Jackson Dome area that have been tested contain significant volumes of CO, and thus the Company believes it is reasonable to expect to develop additional CO reserves from structures identified or delineated by this seismic survey.

CEO Comments
     Gareth Roberts, CEO of Denbury, commented on the Conroe Unit acquisition, saying: "This agreement provides for a significant strategic addition for Denbury, the largest potential tertiary flood we have acquired to date. This will significantly expand our area of operations and growth opportunities in the Texas Gulf Coast region and allow us to more completely utilize the Green Pipeline that is in progress. While the exact timing of the Conroe Unit flood is difficult to forecast at this point, it is our goal to begin flooding this field within the next five years. We are continuing to pursue additional sources of CO, particularly anthropogenic sources in the Gulf Coast area, which if all are developed, would potentially provide us with over 2.5 Bcf/d of CO. While we know that it is highly unlikely that all the proposed plants will be built, we believe that it is reasonable to assume that those that are built will allow us to match or exceed our anticipated volumes from our natural COsource at Jackson Dome. As we desire to keep our balance sheet strong, we plan to investigate the possible sale of our Barnett Shale properties to pay for the Conroe Unit acquisition, potentially in a tax-free like-kind exchange. However, if we are not able to obtain a reasonable price for our Barnett properties, we would still have sufficient credit to finance this acquisition with bank or other debt. This purchase is very significant for us and the effective exchange of the Barnett properties for a large tertiary flood candidate is exactly the transaction we have been looking for. This will make us even more focused on our tertiary operations, which continue to provide Denbury with growth opportunities for years into the future."

     Denbury Resources Inc. is a growing independent oil and natural gas company. The Company is the largest oil and natural gas operator in Mississippi, owns the largest reserves of CO used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and holds significant operating acreage in the Barnett Shale play near Fort Worth, Texas, onshore Louisiana and Alabama, and properties in Southeast Texas. The Company's goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through tertiary recovery operations, combined with a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices.
