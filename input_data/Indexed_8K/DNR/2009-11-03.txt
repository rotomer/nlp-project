Denbury Third Quarter 2009 Production Update
      In light of the delayed quarterly results, the Company is announcing limited third quarter information. Production for the third quarter of 2009 averaged 42,659 BOE/d, an 11% increase from third quarter 2008 production after adjusting for the 2009 sale of 60% of the Company's Barnett Shale natural gas assets. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company's tertiary production averaged 24,347 Bbls/d, a 23% increase from third quarter 2008 production.
     As previously announced, as a result of the sale of 60% of the Company's Barnett Shale properties, the Company lowered its 2009 production guidance to an adjusted full year 2009 average of 47,500 BOE/d, and the Company is reaffirming this annual target. As a result of a combination of minor factors, the Company is reducing its 2009 tertiary production guidance by 1%, from 24,500 Bbls/d to 24,200 Bbls/d, which represents a 25% increase over its 2008 average tertiary production level. The Company's tertiary production has continued to increase early in the fourth quarter and has averaged between 25,500 and 26,000 Bbls/d during the last two weeks of October 2009, on track to meet its revised annual target of 24,200 Bbls/d. The Company anticipates that its average 2010 tertiary production will be approximately 27,000 Bbls/d, a projected 12% increase over 2009 projected levels.
