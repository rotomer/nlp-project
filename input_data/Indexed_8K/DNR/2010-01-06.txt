Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On December 30, 2009, Denbury Resources Inc. ("Denbury"), completed its previously announced sale of its remaining 40% interest in its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon Oil & Gas LLC ("Talon"), a privately held company, for a purchase price of $210 million, subject to closing adjustments. The effective date of the purchase and sale agreement was December 1, 2009. The assets sold in the transaction, which completed the sale of all of Denbury's Barnett Shale assets, included oil and gas leases, real property, personal property, incidental rights, and the December 1, 2009 inventory of unsold hydrocarbons attributable to the leases. Production from these Barnett Shale assets averaged approximately 4,596 BOE/d during the third quarter of 2009. The proceeds of the sale were used to reduce outstanding bank debt. The sale was structured as a deferred like-kind exchange in conjunction with Denbury's purchase of Conroe Field that closed on December 18, 2009.
In June and July 2009, Denbury sold 60% of its interest in its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon for a net purchase price of $259.8 million. The proceeds of the sale were used to repay bank debt. The effective date of the agreement for this sale was June 1, 2009.
The attached unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the sale of 40% of Denbury's interest in its Barnett Shale natural gas assets as if the sale occurred on September 30, 2009. The effect of the earlier sale of 60% of Denbury's interest in its Barnett Shale natural gas assets is reflected in Denbury's historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2009, as the earlier sale occurred prior to September 30, 2009. The attached unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30 , 2009 include the sale of 60% and subsequent sale of 40% of Denbury's interest in the Barnett Shale natural gas assets as if each occurred on January 1, 2008.

     Exhibit 99.1  Pro forma Financial Information

Exhibit 99.1
     The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations give effect to the following transactions:
     . In May 2009, Denbury Resources Inc. ("Denbury") entered into an agreement to sell 60% of its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon Oil and Gas LLC ("Talon"), a privately held company, for $270 million (before closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was June 1, 2009, and consequently operating net revenues after June 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. In June 2009, Denbury completed approximately three-quarters of the sale and closed the remaining portion of the sale in July 2009. Net proceeds of the sale were $259.8 million (after closing adjustments and net of $8.1 million paid on natural gas swaps transferred in the sale). Denbury used the net proceeds from the sale to repay bank debt. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting.
May 2009 Sale of 60% of Denbury's Barnett Shale Natural Gas Assets
     In December 2009, Denbury closed the sale of its remaining 40% interest in Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon for $210 million (before closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was December 1, 2009. The proceeds of this sale were used to reduce outstanding bank debt. Denbury does not expect to record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. Further, the sale was structured as a deferred like-kind exchange in conjunction with its December 2009 purchase of Conroe Field in order to defer most of the tax impacts of the sale.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet which follows gives effect to the sale of 40% of Denbury's Barnett Shale natural gas assets as if the sale occurred on September 30, 2009. The effect of the May 2009 sale of 60% of its Barnett Shale natural gas assets is included in its historical condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2009 as the sale occurred prior to September 30, 2009.
