     On March 9, 2010, Denbury Resources Inc. ("Denbury) entered into a new Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the 23 other lenders party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"). The information regarding the Credit Agreement provided in Item 2.03 below is incorporated by reference herein.
Cash Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations for Encore Senior Subordinated Notes; Supplements to Indentures Governing Encore Senior Subordinated Notes
     On March 10, 2010, Denbury accepted for purchase all 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "6.25% Securities"), 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "6.0% Securities"), and 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "7.25% Securities" and, together with the 6.25% Securities and the 6.0% Securities, the "Securities") of Encore Acquisition Company ("Encore") tendered by holders pursuant to cash tender offers and consent solicitations commenced by Denbury on February 8, 2010. An aggregate of (1) $108,216,000 principal amount of the 6.25% Securities, or 72 percent of the outstanding 6.25% Securities, (2) $268,801,000 principal amount of the 6.0% Securities, or 90 percent of the outstanding 6.0% Securities, and (3) $123,515,000 principal amount of the 7.25% Securities, or 82 percent of the outstanding 7.25% Securities, were tendered pursuant to the offers.

The offers and the solicitations expired at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on March 10, 2010.
     The tender of Securities also constituted the delivery of consents of holders of the Securities to eliminate or modify certain provisions contained in each indenture governing the Securities (each an "Encore Indenture" and, collectively, the "Encore Indentures"). Denbury received sufficient consents in the solicitations to amend the Encore Indentures.
     On March 9, 2010, Encore merged with and into Denbury, and Denbury became party to the Encore Indentures as successor to Encore. The description of the Encore Indentures and the 9.5% Indenture, as defined in Item 2.03, is incorporated by reference from Item 2.03.
     Effective as of March 10, 2010, the Encore Indentures governing each series of Securities were amended as follows:
 
The foregoing amendments to the Encore Indentures do not apply to the 9.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "9.5% Securities").
     Effective as of March 10, 2010, the Encore Indenture governing the 7.25% Securities also was amended, solely as it relates to the 7.25% Securities, as follows:
     In addition, the following Denbury subsidiaries were added as guarantors under the Encore Indentures: (1) Denbury Onshore, LLC, (2) Denbury Gathering & Marketing, Inc., (3) Denbury Operating Company, (4) Denbury Marine, L.L.C., (5) Tuscaloosa Royalty Fund LLC, (6) Denbury Green Pipeline-Texas, LLC and (7) Denbury Encore Holdings Inc. These Denbury subsidiaries also were added as guarantors for the 9.5% Securities.
     The foregoing description of the supplemental indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the supplemental indentures attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1.4, 4.2.4 and 4.3.6, and incorporated by reference herein. A copy of the related press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Consummation of Acquisition of Encore Acquisition Company
     On Tuesday evening, March 9, 2010, following approval by the stockholders of both Denbury and Encore at special meetings held that morning and subsequent satisfaction of conditions precedent that afternoon and evening, including completion of required closing documentation, the merger of Encore with and into Denbury (the "Merger"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 31, 2009, between Denbury and Encore (the "Merger Agreement") was consummated upon filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State that evening. Trading in Encore's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") (NYSE: EAC) terminated after market close on Tuesday, March 9, 2010.
     The Merger was financed through a combination of $1 billion of 8/% Senior Subordinated Notes of Denbury due 2020, which closed on February 10, 2010, and the Credit Agreement described in Item 2.03 herein in greater detail, entered into on March 9, 2010.

     In the Merger, Denbury issued approximately 134.4 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $829.4 million in cash to Encore stockholders. The Denbury shares issued to Encore stockholders represent approximately 33.9% of Denbury's issued and outstanding common stock after the Merger, based upon the number of Denbury shares outstanding at January 31, 2010.
     Encore shareholders received the following consideration for each share of Encore common stock they owned, depending upon the elections, if any, which they made, and the collar, proration and allocation features of the Merger Agreement so that, in the aggregate, 30% of the consideration for the outstanding shares of Encore common stock consists of cash, and the remaining 70% of the consideration consists of shares of Denbury common stock:
     1. Mixed cash/stock electing (or non-electing) Encore stockholders received $15 in cash and 2.4048 shares of Denbury common stock;
     2. All-cash electing Encore stockholders received $46.48 in cash and 0.2417 of a share of Denbury common stock; and
     3. All-stock electing Encore stockholders (or those whose Encore restricted stock bonuses converted into Denbury restricted stock) received 3.4354 shares of Denbury common stock.
     All Encore stock options fully vested and their value was paid in cash. All Encore restricted stock vested and each holder had the opportunity to make the same elections as other holders of Encore common stock as described above, except for shares of Encore restricted stock granted as a 2009 bonus
 
pursuant to the Encore annual incentive program, which were converted into restricted shares of Denbury common stock. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, fractional shares of Denbury common stock will not be issued, and in lieu thereof, Encore stockholders received cash for their fractional share interests based on the closing price of Denbury common stock on the NYSE on Monday, March 8, 2010.
     The number of Denbury shares to be issued to Encore public holders was determined in accordance with Section 2.1 of the Merger Agreement, with the exchange ratio of the number of shares of Denbury common stock to be exchanged for each share of Encore common stock determined by dividing $35.00 (in the case of mixed cash/stock elections, or no elections) or $50.00 (in the case of all-stock elections) by the volume weighted average price of Denbury common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the second full trading day prior to the effective time of the Merger, being the 20 trading days beginning February 8, 2010 through and including March 8, 2010, or a volume weighted average price of $14.5543 per Denbury share (all as more fully provided in the Merger Agreement), subject to the collar, proration, and allocation features provided therein.
     The Merger is structured to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such that each Encore stockholder generally should be subject to U.S. federal income tax only on the cash it receives in the Merger.
     A copy of the Merger Agreement has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 2.1 to Denbury's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2009 and as Annex A to Denbury's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-163521) and is incorporated into this Item 2.01 by reference.
     The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the description of the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to Denbury's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2009 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
New $1.6 Billion Credit Facility
     On March 9, 2010, Denbury entered into the Credit Agreement as defined in Item 1.01 above. The aggregate amount of the commitments of the lenders under the Credit Agreement is $1.6 billion. Availability under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which is redetermined semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 and upon requested special redeterminations. The Credit Agreement provides for an initial borrowing base of $1.6 billion. The borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed based on the reserves and certain other oil and natural gas assets of Denbury and its restricted subsidiaries, as confirmed by the banks, while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The borrowing base is adjusted at the banks' discretion and is based in part upon external factors over which Denbury has no control. If the borrowing base were to be less than outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, Denbury would be required to repay the deficit over a period of four months. The loans under the Credit Agreement mature in March 2014.
     Denbury's new bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of the proved oil and natural gas
 
properties of Denbury's restricted subsidiaries and by the equity interests of Denbury's restricted subsidiaries. In addition, Denbury's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by its restricted subsidiaries. The restricted subsidiaries include most of the subsidiaries of the combined company after the Merger.
     The Credit Agreement contains several restrictive covenants including, among others: (1) a prohibition on the payment of dividends to parties other than Denbury and its restricted subsidiaries; (2) a requirement to maintain positive working capital, as determined under the Credit Agreement; (3) a maximum permitted ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA of Denbury and its restricted subsidiaries; and (4) a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions. Additionally, there is a limitation on the aggregate amount of forecasted oil and natural gas production that can be economically hedged with oil or natural gas derivative contracts. Denbury was in compliance with all of the bank covenants as of the consummation of the Merger.
     Loans under the Credit Agreement are subject to varying rates of interest based on (1) the total outstanding borrowings in relation to the borrowing base and (2) whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or a base rate loan. Eurodollar loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin indicated in the Credit Agreement, and base rate loans bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin indicated in the Credit Agreement. The "Eurodollar rate" for any interest period (either one, two, three, six, nine or twelve months, as selected by Denbury) is the rate per year equal to LIBOR, as published by Reuters or another source designated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., for deposits in dollars for a similar interest period. The "base rate" is calculated as the highest of (1) the annual rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its "prime rate," (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent, and (3) the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Encore Indentures and the Encore Indenture with Respect to the 9.5% Securities
     On March 9, 2010, upon the Merger of Encore with and into Denbury, Denbury became successor in interest to Encore under the Encore Indentures as defined and described in Item 1.01 incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference and under the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 27, 2009 to the Indenture of Encore dated as of November 16, 2009 with respect to the 9.5% Securities in the amount of $225 million (the "9.5% Indenture"). The material terms are as follows:
 
     The Encore Indentures continue to have, and the 9.5% Indenture also has, covenants limiting the sale of assets and providing a put right by holders upon change of control. The foregoing description of the Encore Indentures and the 9.5% Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the indentures and the related supplemental indentures attached hereto as Exhibits 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.3.5 and 4.3.6, and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
Special Stockholders Meeting Held March 9, 2010
     Special meetings of the stockholders of both Denbury and Encore were held on March 9, 2010, to consider and vote upon proposals to adopt the Merger Agreement, which provides for, among other things, the Merger of Encore with and into Denbury, and in Denbury's case the issuance of Denbury common stock to Encore stockholders as part of the Merger consideration.

Item 8.01 Other Events.

Denbury has succeeded, by virtue of the Merger, to Encore's position as obligor on all Encore senior subordinated notes which remain outstanding after the cash tender offers described in Item 1.01 above, and, in accordance with, and as required by, the applicable indentures, Denbury has notified the holders thereof of their right to resell those notes to Denbury at 101% of the face amount thereof as a result of the change of control of Encore as a result of the Merger on March 9, 2010. A copy of the press release announcing the change of control offer is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto.

INDENTURE dated as of April 2, 2004, among ENCORE ACQUISITION COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the guarantors listed on the signature pages hereto and WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). Each party agrees as follows for the benefit of the other parties and for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Company's Initial Securities, Exchange Securities and Private Exchange Securities (collectively, the "Securities"): ARTICLE 1 Definitions and Incorporation by Reference SECTION 1.01. Definitions. "Additional Assets" means (1) any property, plant or equipment used in a Related Business; (2) the Capital Stock of a Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of such Capital Stock by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) Capital Stock constituting a minority interest in any Person that at such time is a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that any such Restricted Subsidiary described in clause (2) or (3) above is primarily engaged in a Related Business. "Additional Securities" means, subject to the Company's compliance with Section 4.03, 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2014 issued from time to time after the Issue Date under the terms of this Indenture (other than pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.07, 2.09 or 3.06 of this Indenture and other than Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued pursuant to an exchange offer for other Securities outstanding under this Indenture).

The Initial Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to the Appendix, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms of the Securities set forth in the Appendix and Exhibit A are part of the terms of this Indenture. SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. The Company's seal shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities and may be in facsimile form. If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless. A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver $150 million of 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2014, and, at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities for original issue in an aggregate principal amount specified in such order, in each case upon a written order of the Company signed by two Officers or by an Officer and either an Assistant Treasurer or an Assistant Secretary of the Company. Such order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated and, in the case of an issuance of Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 after the Issue Date, shall certify that such issuance is in compliance with Section 4.03. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as any Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service of notices and demands. - 39 -
SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent. The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities. SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. Prior to each due date of the principal of and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. SECTION 2.05. Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders. SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met. - 40 -
SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security. Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company. SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security. If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent is not prohibited from paying such money to the Securityholders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. SECTION 2.09. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities. SECTION 2.10. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. - 41 -
SECTION 2.11. Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. SECTION 2.12. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use numbers assigned by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures ("CUSIP") and corresponding International Securities Identification Numbers ("ISIN") (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers and corresponding "ISIN's" (if then generally in use) in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or ISIN numbers. SECTION 2.13. Issuance of Additional Securities. The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.03, to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture. With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officers' Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information: (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture; (2) the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities; provided, however, that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code; and (3) whether such Additional Securities shall be Transfer Restricted Securities and issued in the form of Initial Securities as set forth in the Appendix to this Indenture or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in Exhibit A. - 42 -

The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000.

In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section. SECTION 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption.

Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date). Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder. SECTION 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

SECTION 3.07. Special Mandatory Redemption. Following the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger, the Company shall redeem the Securities as a whole (the "Special Mandatory Redemption"), upon notice as provided in this Section 3.07, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

SECTION 4.06. Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless: (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair market value (including as to the value of all non-cash consideration) (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, an Officer or an officer of such Restricted Subsidiary with responsibility for such transaction, which determination shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with this provision), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition; (2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or cash equivalents, Additional Assets or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Cash Consideration"); and - 55 -
(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Company (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be): (A) first, to the extent the Company elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness (other than any Disqualified Stock) of a Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; (B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the extent the Company elects, to acquire Additional Assets or to make capital expenditures in the Oil and Gas Business within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and (C) third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clauses (A) and (B), to make an offer to the holders of the Securities (and to holders of other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company designated by the Company) to purchase Securities (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to and subject to the conditions contained in this Indenture; provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A) or (C) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased. Upon any Asset Disposition by an Oil and Gas Royalty Trust in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will apply the Net Available Cash therefrom as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.06 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.06 exceeds $20.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.06, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness. - 56 -
For the purposes of this Section 4.06, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: (1) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Securities or any Subsidiary Guaranty) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to (1) a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (2) an assignment agreement that includes, in lieu of such a release, the agreement of the transferee or its parent company to indemnify and hold harmless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from and against any loss, liability or cost in respect of such assumed liability (provided, however, that such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) shall have an Investment Grade Rating (with no indication of a negative outlook or credit watch with negative implications, in any case, that contemplates such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) failing to have an Investment Grade Rating) at the time the indemnity is entered into); (2) any non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that is converted, monetized, sold or exchanged by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or cash equivalents within 120 days of receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in Section 4.06(a)(2) shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation. The requirement of Section 4.06(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed to be satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement. (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Securities (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase Securities (an "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and shall purchase Securities tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Securities (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the - 57 -
accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Securities will be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Securities (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 4.06 if the Net Available Cash not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) or (B) is less than $20.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer. (c) (1) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Securities purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.06(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision (which at a minimum will include (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Company, the most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report, other than Current Reports describing Asset Dispositions otherwise described in the information furnished with such notice (or corresponding successor reports), (B) a description of material developments in the Company's business subsequent to the date of the latest of such Reports, and (C) if material, appropriate pro forma financial information) and all instructions and materials necessary to tender Securities pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3). (2) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.06(a) and (b). On such date, the Company shall also irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with - 58 -
any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Securities delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Securities, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.06. (3) Holders electing to have a Security purchased shall be required to surrender the Security, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Security which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered. (4) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.06. A Security shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder. (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.06. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. SECTION 4.07. Limitation on Affiliate Transactions. (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, employee compensation arrangements or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless: (1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate; - 59 -
(2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $10.0 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and a majority of the non-employee directors of the Company disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and have approved the relevant Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and (3) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $25.0 million, the Board of Directors shall also have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or is not less favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate. (b) Section 4.07(a) will not prohibit: (1) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited to be made pursuant to Section 4.04; (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment and severance arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans, phantom stock or other incentive plans approved by the Board of Directors; (3) loans or advances to officers, directors and employees in the ordinary course of business of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, but in any event not to exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate outstanding at any one time; (4) any transaction with a Restricted Subsidiary or joint venture or similar entity which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, joint venture or similar entity; (5) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; (6) reasonable fees and reasonable compensation paid to, and indemnity and similar arrangements provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company's senior management; and - 60 -
(7) any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date or any renewals, extensions or replacements of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or replacements are not less favorable to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries than the original agreement in effect on the Issue Date) and the transactions evidenced thereby. SECTION 4.08. Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, then unless the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem all the Securities each Holder shall have the right to require that the Company repurchase such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the terms contemplated in Section 4.08(b). In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company (including the Revolving Credit Facility) restrict or prohibit the repurchase of Securities following such Change of Control, then prior to the mailing of the notice to Holders provided for in Section 4.08(b) below but in any event within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall (1) repay in full all such Senior Indebtedness or (ii) obtain the requisite consents under the agreements governing such Senior Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the Securities as provided for in Section 4.08(b). (b) Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Securities and shall have delivered irrevocable notice of redemption to the Trustee, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer") stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); (2) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization, each after giving effect to such Change of Control); (3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and (4) the instructions, as determined by the Company, consistent with this Section 4.08, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Securities purchased. (c) Holders electing to have a Security purchased will be required to surrender the Security, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the purchase date. Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the purchase date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the -61-
name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Security which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased. (d) On the purchase date, all Securities purchased by the Company under this Section 4.08 shall be delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall pay the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Holders entitled thereto. (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.08, the Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. (f) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.08, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 4.08 by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. SECTION 4.09. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien securing Indebtedness of any kind except for Permitted Liens, on or with respect to any of its assets, whether owned at the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, unless (A) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Obligations, the Securities are secured by a Lien on such assets that is senior in priority to such Lien and (B) in the case of any other Lien, the Securities are either secured equally and ratably with such Indebtedness or are secured by a Lien on such assets that is senior in priority to such Lien. SECTION 4.10. Future Guarantors. The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that Incurs any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with the last clause of Section 4.03(b)(16)) to, at the same time, execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Securities on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in this Indenture. SECTION 4.11. Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company an Officers' Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of the Company they would normally have knowledge of any Default and whether or not the signers know of any Default that occurred during such period. If they do, the certificate shall describe the Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Company also shall comply with TIA Section 314(a)(4). -62-
SECTION 4.12. Further Instruments and Acts. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture. SECTION 4.13. Suspension of Covenants. (a) During any period that the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating and no Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be subject to Sections 4.03(a), (b), (c) or (d), 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.10 or 5.01(a)(3) (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). (b) In the event that the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of Section 4.13(a), and subsequently one or both of S&P and Moody's downgrades the rating assigned to the Securities below BBB-, in the case of S&P, and below Baa3, in the case of Moody's, then the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants (subject to subsequent suspension if the Securities again receive an Investment Grade Rating), and, with respect to Restricted Payments proposed to be made after the time of such downgrade, the permissibility of such proposed Restricted Payments will be calculated in accordance with Section 4.04 as though Section 4.04 had been in effect since the Issue Date. ARTICLE 5 Successor Company SECTION 5.01. When Company May Merge or Transfer Assets. (a) The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one transaction or a series of transactions, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, any Person, unless: (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (2) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.03(a); -63-
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture; and (5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such transaction and will not be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such transaction had not occurred; provided, however, that Section 5.01(a)(3) will not be applicable (A) to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into, conveying, transferring or leasing all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor, (B) to the Company merging with an Affiliate of the Company solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction or (C) at a time when the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants. For purposes of this Section 5.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company. The Successor Company (if not the Company) shall be the successor to the Company and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, and the predecessor Company, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities. (b) The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one transaction or series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless: (1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than Encore Operating, L.P. and any Subsidiary Guarantor that directly or indirectly holds an equity interest in Encore Operating, L.P.) that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets, if in connection therewith the Company complies with its obligations under Section 4.06 in respect of such disposition, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Subsidiary) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary was organized or under the laws of the United States of America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and, if such Person is not already a Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary, if any, under its Subsidiary Guaranty; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), -64-
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) in the event a Guaranty Agreement is executed and delivered pursuant to clause (1) above, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with this Indenture. ARTICLE 6 Defaults and Remedies SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs if: (1) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Security when the same becomes due and payable, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by Article 10, and such default continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by Article 10; (3) the Company fails to comply with Section 3.07 or 5.01; (4) the Company fails to comply with Section 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, or 4.10 (other than a failure to purchase Securities when required under Section 4.06 or 4.08) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice specified below; (5) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with any of its agreements in this Indenture (other than those referred to in clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice specified below; (6) Indebtedness of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $10.0 million; provided, that if such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such Indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 10 days from the continuance of such default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default and any consequential acceleration of the Securities shall be automatically rescinded, so long as such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree; (7) the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case; -65-
(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case; (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case; (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its property; or (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary; or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days; or (9) any judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million above the coverage under applicable insurance policies and indemnities as to which the relevant insurer or indemnitor has not disclaimed responsibility is entered against the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary, remains outstanding for a period of 60 consecutive days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the "judgment default provision"); or (10) a Subsidiary Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Subsidiary Guaranty) for five days after notice or a Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty (the "Guaranty Failure Provision"). The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. A Default under clauses (4), (5) or (10) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the -66-
Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default". The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (6) or (10) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5) or (9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities) by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default with respect to all of the Securities and its consequences (including, without limitation, waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchases of, Securities or a solicitations of consents in respect of the Securities) except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security, (ii) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to this Indenture or (iii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured and shall cease to exist, -67-
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Securityholder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities make a request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Securityholder. SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07. -68-
SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order: FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07; SECOND: to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and, if such money or property has been collected from a Subsidiary Guarantor, to holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case to the extent required by Articles 10 and 12; THIRD: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and FOURTH: to the Company. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid. SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities. SECTION 6.12. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede -69-
the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE 7 Trustee SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05. (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section. (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. (f) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. -70-
(g) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (h) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA. SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document, but may accept the same as conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of such statement or the correctness of such opinions. (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care. (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence. (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Securities shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel. SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in the Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication. -71-
SECTION 7.05. Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such Security, if any), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is not opposed to the interests of Securityholders. The Trustee shall not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any Event of Default, except failure of the Company to cause to be made any required payment to the Trustee, unless the Trustee shall be specifically notified of such default by the Company or by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then outstanding by a notice delivered to the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and, in the absence of such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume no Default exists. SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. As promptly as practicable after each June 15 beginning with the June 15 following the date of this Indenture, and in any event prior to August 15 in each year, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of June 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities. -72-
The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law. SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company may remove the Trustee if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee. SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. -73-
In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have. SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Section 310(a). The Trustee shall be a corporation, bank or banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any state that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trustee power and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA Section 310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA Section 310(b)(1) are met. SECTION 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated. ARTICLE 8 Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance SECTION 8.01. Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance. (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Securities have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c), cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company. (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08 and 4.09 and -74-
the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) and the limitations contained in Sections 5.01(a)(3) ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and 6.01(8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guaranty. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates. (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive. SECTION 8.02. Conditions to Defeasance. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if: (1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be; (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be; (3) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the 123-day period; (4) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement binding on the Company and is not prohibited by Article 10; -75-
(5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred; (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; (8) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the jurisdiction or organization of the Company (if other than the United States) to the effect that (A) Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for income tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance, and will be subject to income tax of such jurisdiction on the same amounts, and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and (9) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities as contemplated by this Article 8 have been complied with. Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3. SECTION 8.03. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities. Money and securities so held in trust are not subject to Article 10. SECTION 8.04. Repayment to Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time. Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of -76-
principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors. SECTION 8.05. Indemnity for Government Obligations. The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations. SECTION 8.06. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations under their respective Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. ARTICLE 9 Amendments SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. Subject to Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Securityholder: (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; (2) to comply with Article 5; (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; provided, however, that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code; (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Securities, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, to secure the Securities or to confirm the release, termination or discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under this Indenture; (5) to add to the covenants of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor; -77-
(6) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, this Indenture under the TIA; (7) to make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Securityholder; or (8) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision in the Offering Circular in the section "Description of the Notes" to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture, the Guarantees or the Securities. However, no amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of this Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor then outstanding unless such holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or its Representative) consents to such change or as otherwise permitted by the notes, debentures, bonds or other similar instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness. The consent of the holders of the Securities is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.01. SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities, or waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provisions hereof or thereof, without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities). However, without the consent of each Securityholder affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Securities held by a non-consenting Holder): (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver; (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security; (3) reduce the principal amount of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Security; (4) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or is required to be redeemed in accordance with Article 3; -78-
(5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security; (6) impair the right of any Securityholder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Securityholder's securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Securityholder's Securities; (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 or the second sentence of this Section 9.02; (8) make any change in the ranking or priority of any Security that would adversely affect the Securityholders; or (9) make any change in any Subsidiary Guaranty that would adversely affect the Securityholders in any material respect. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02. SECTION 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect. SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers. A consent to an amendment, a supplement or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent, supplement or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment, a supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and any subsequent Holder of such Security or any Security that evidences all or any part of the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any -79-
such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date. SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment. SECTION 9.06. Trustee To Sign Amendments. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. SECTION 9.07. Payment for Consent. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. ARTICLE 10 Subordination SECTION 10.01. Agreement To Subordinate. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 10, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Securities shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and only Indebtedness of the Company which is Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article 10 shall be subject to Section 10.12. -80-
SECTION 10.02. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property: (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment of principal of or interest on the Securities; and (2) until such Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Securityholders would be entitled but for this Article 10 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Securityholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the Securities. SECTION 10.03. Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company. The Company shall not pay the principal of or interest on the Securities or make any deposit pursuant to Section 8.01 and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Securities (collectively, "pay the Securities") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the Securities without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the Securities for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to the Company) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be entitled to resume payments on the Securities after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. The Securities shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the -81-
Company during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days. SECTION 10.04. Acceleration of Payment of Securities. If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or their Representatives) of the acceleration. SECTION 10.05. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over. If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this Article 10 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. SECTION 10.06. Subrogation. After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article 10 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the Company and Securityholders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 10.07. Relative Rights. This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall: (1) impair, as between the Company and Securityholders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms; or (2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders. SECTION 10.08. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company. No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with this Indenture. -82-
SECTION 10.09. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent. Notwithstanding Section 10.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article 10 would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 10. The Company, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 10 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 10 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07. SECTION 10.10. Distribution or Notice to Representative. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any). SECTION 10.11. Article 10 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Accelerate. The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in this Article 10 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 10 shall have any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Securities. SECTION 10.12. Trust Moneys and Escrow Funds Not Subordinated. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from either (i) money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article 8 by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities or (ii) any funds received by the Trustee or Paying Agent from the Escrow Agent following the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 10, and none of the Securityholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company. SECTION 10.13. Trustee Entitled To Rely. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of -83-
such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 10, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 10. SECTION 10.14. Trustee To Effectuate Subordination. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Securityholders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in this Article 10 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 10.15. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10 or otherwise. SECTION 10.16. Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness. ARTICLE 11 Subsidiary Guaranties SECTION 11.01. Guaranties. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the -84-
Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 11 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 11.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 11.02 and 11.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation -85-
when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 11.01. Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 11.01. SECTION 11.02. Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. SECTION 11.03. Successors and Assigns. This Article 11 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. SECTION 11.04. No Waiver. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 11 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 11 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. SECTION 11.05. Modification. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 11, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for -86-
the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. SECTION 11.06. Release of Subsidiary Guarantor. Upon (a) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (c) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article 11 without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release. ARTICLE 12 Subordination of Subsidiary Guaranties SECTION 12.01. Agreement To Subordinate. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 12, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guaranty of Senior Indebtedness of the Company) shall rank senior to the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. SECTION 12.02. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property: (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Securityholders would be entitled but for this Article 12 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Securityholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as Subsidiary Guaranty. -87-
SECTION 12.03. Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make its Subsidiary Guaranty or purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any Securities or other Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to such Subsidiary Guarantor) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such -88-
Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days. SECTION 12.04. Demand for Payment. If a demand for payment is made on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 11, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand. SECTION 12.05. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over. If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this Article 12 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear. SECTION 12.06. Subrogation. After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article 12 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 12.07. Relative Rights. This Article 12 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall: (1) impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article 11; or (2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders. SECTION 12.08. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company. No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Subsidiary Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture. SECTION 12.09. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent. Notwithstanding Section 12.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 12. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of -89-
Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 12 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 12 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07. SECTION 12.10. Distribution or Notice to Representative. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any). SECTION 12.11. Article 12 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Demand Payment. The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article 12 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 12 shall have any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty. SECTION 12.12. Trustee Entitled To Rely. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 12. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 12, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 12. SECTION 12.13. Trustee To Effectuate Subordination. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may -90-
be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Securityholders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in this Article 12 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 12.14. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 12 or otherwise. SECTION 12.15. Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors on Subordination Provisions. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness. ARTICLE 13 Miscellaneous SECTION 13.01. Trust Indenture Act Controls. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control. SECTION 13.02. Notices. Any notice or communication shall be in writing and delivered in person or mailed by first-class mail addressed as follows: if to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor: Encore Acquisition Company 777 Main Street Suite 1400 Fort Worth, TX 76102 Attention: Roy W.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Securityholder shall be mailed to the Securityholder at the Securityholder's address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Securityholder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Securityholders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. SECTION 13.03. Communication by Holders with Other Holders. Securityholders may communicate pursuant to TIA Section 312(b) with other Securityholders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities. The Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA Section 312(c). SECTION 13.04. Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent. Upon any request or application by the Company to the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action under this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee: (1) an Officers' Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with; and (2) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with. SECTION 13.05. Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion. Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a covenant or condition provided for in this Indenture shall include: (1) a statement that the individual making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition; -92-
(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such individual, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such individual, such covenant or condition has been complied with. SECTION 13.06. When Securities Disregarded. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination. SECTION 13.07. Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar. The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or a meeting of Securityholders. The Registrar and the Paying Agent may make reasonable rules for their functions. SECTION 13.08. Legal Holidays. A "Legal Holiday" is a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions are not required to be open in the State of New York, Texas or Minnesota. If a payment date is a Legal Holiday, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period. If a regular record date is a Legal Holiday, the record date shall not be affected. SECTION 13.09. Governing Law. This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York but without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another jurisdiction would be required thereby. SECTION 13.10. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or this Indenture or of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty or this Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release shall be part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. SECTION 13.11. Successors. All agreements of the Company in this Indenture and the Securities shall bind their respective successors. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors. -93-

[FORM OF] REVERSE SIDE OF [INITIAL] SECURITY 6.25% Senior Subordinated Security Due 2014 1. Interest Encore Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above; provided, however, that if a Registration Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, additional interest will accrue on this Security at a rate of 0.25% per annum (increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum after each consecutive 90-day period that occurs after the date on which such Registration default occurs up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00%) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. The Company will pay interest semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2004. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from April 2, 2004. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 2. Method of Payment The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). 3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a United States banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar. -5-
4. Indenture The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of April 2, 2004 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.03 of the Indenture, to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock; make investments; issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; create liens on assets; transfer or sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; restrict dividends or other payments of subsidiaries; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries. During any period that the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both S&P and Moody's and no Default has occurred and is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 5. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Company shall not be entitled to redeem the Securities at its option prior to April 15, 2009. On and after April 15, 2009, the Company shall be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Securities upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount on the redemption date), plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 15 of the years set forth below: In addition, prior to April 15, 2007, the Company shall be entitled at its option on one or more occasions to redeem Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) in an -6-
aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) issued prior to the redemption date at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 106.250%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds from one or more Public Equity Offerings; provided, however, that (1) at least 65% of such aggregate principal amount of Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Securities held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or its Affiliates); and (2) each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the related Public Equity Offering. Prior to April 15, 2009, the Company may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) the Securities (which includes the Additional Securities, if any) at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (1) the principal amount thereof, plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus (3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date. 6. Notice of Redemption Except as described in paragraph 7 below, notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 7. Escrow; Special Mandatory Redemption The Initial Purchasers of the Initial Securities have deposited the gross proceeds of the offering thereof with the Escrow Agent on the Issue Date. The Escrow Agent will hold such funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and, subject to the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement, it will either disburse such funds to the Company and the Initial Purchasers or disburse them to the Trustee or the Paying Agent for application to the mandatory redemption of the Initial Securities following the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger. Following the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger, the Company shall redeem the Securities as a whole, upon notice as provided below, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6, notice of such mandatory redemption shall be given within five Business Days of the date of the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the redemption date, to the Escrow Agent and to each Holder, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register, and such notice shall state: -7-
(1) that the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger has occurred; (2) the redemption date, which shall be on or before July 30, 2004; (3) the redemption price; (4) that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable upon each Security to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date; and (5) the place or places where each Security is to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price. Any notice of redemption given pursuant to this paragraph 7 may be modified by the Company to conform with the applicable requirements of the Depositary if any of the Securities subject to such notice are then represented by one or more Global Securities. 8. Put Provisions Upon a Change of Control, then unless the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem all the Securities, any Holder of Securities will have the right to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Securities of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. 9. Subordination The Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness of the Company must be paid before the Securities may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorizes the Trustee to give it effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose. 10. Guaranty The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior subordinated basis by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. 11. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000.

by law or permitted by the Indenture.

Persons Deemed Owners The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 13. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment. 14. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be. 15. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture and the Securities may be amended or supplemented, and compliance with any provision of the Indenture may be waived, with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities.

16. Defaults and Remedies Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; (ii) default in payment of principal on the Securities at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise, or failure by the Company to redeem or purchase Securities when required; (iii) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $10.0 million, provided that such acceleration is not rescinded within a period of 10 days from the occurrence of such acceleration; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (vi) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million; and (vii) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guaranties.

[FORM OF] REVERSE SIDE OF [EXCHANGE] SECURITY [OR PRIVATE EXCHANGE SECURITY] 6.25% Senior Subordinated Security Due 2014 1. Interest Encore Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation (such corporation, and its successors and assigns under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, being herein called the "Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate per annum shown above[; provided, however, that if a Registration Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, additional interest will accrue on this Security at a rate of ..25% per annum (increasing by an additional .25% per annum after each consecutive 90-day period that occurs after the date on which such Registration Default occurs up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per annum) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured.](1) The Company will pay interest semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2004. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from April 2, 2004. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 2. Method of Payment The Company will pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered holders of Securities at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 next preceding the interest payment date even if Securities are canceled after the record date and on or before the interest payment date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The Company will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of the Securities represented by a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by The Depository Trust Company. The Company will make all payments in respect of a certificated Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by mailing a check to the registered address of each Holder thereof; provided, however, that payments on a certificated Security will be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if such Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). - ------------------ (1) Insert if at the date of issuance of the Exchange Security or Private Exchange Security (as the case may be) any Registration Default has occurred with respect to the related Initial Securities during the interest period in which such date of issuance occurs. -3-
3. Paying Agent and Registrar Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a United States banking association (the "Trustee"), will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated Wholly Owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-registrar. 4. Indenture The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated April 2, 2004 ("Indenture"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. Sections 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and the Act for a statement of those terms. The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.03 of the Indenture, to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock; make investments; issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries; engage in transactions with affiliates; create liens on assets; transfer or sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; restrict dividends or other payments of subsidiaries; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries; and engage in business activities unrelated to its current activities. During any period that the Securities have an Investment Grade Rating from both S&P and Moody's and no Default has occurred and is continuing, certain covenants will be suspended. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. 5. Optional Redemption Except as set forth below, the Company shall not be entitled to redeem the Securities at its option prior to April 15, 2009. On and after April 15, 2009, the Company shall be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Securities upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount, on the redemption date) plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 15 of the years set forth below: -4-
In addition, prior to April 15, 2007, the Company shall be entitled at its option on one or more occasions to redeem Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) issued prior to the redemption date at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 106.250%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds from one or more Public Equity Offerings; provided, however, that (1) at least 65% of such aggregate principal amount of Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Securities held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or its Affiliates); and (2) each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the related Public Equity Offering. Prior to April 15, 2009, the Company may at its option redeem all (but not less than all) the Securities (which includes the Additional Securities, if any) at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (1) the principal amount thereof, plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus (3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date. 6. Notice of Redemption Except as described in paragraph 7 below, notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000. If money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the redemption date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or before the redemption date and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such date interest ceases to accrue on such Securities (or such portions thereof) called for redemption. 7. Escrow; Special Mandatory Redemption The Initial Purchasers of the Initial Securities have deposited the gross proceeds of the offering thereof with the Escrow Agent on the Issue Date. The Escrow Agent will hold such funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and, subject to the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement, it will either disburse such funds to the Company and the Initial Purchasers -5-
or disburse them to the Trustee or the Paying Agent for application to the mandatory redemption of the Initial Securities following the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger. Following the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger, the Company shall redeem the Securities as a whole, upon notice as provided below, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 6, notice of such mandatory redemption shall be given within five Business Days of the date of the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the redemption date, to the Escrow Agent and to each Holder, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register, and such notice shall state: (1) that the Special Mandatory Redemption Trigger has occurred; (2) the redemption date, which shall be on or before July 30, 2004; (3) the redemption price; (4) that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable upon each Security to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date; and (5) the place or places where each Security is to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price. Any notice of redemption given pursuant to this paragraph 7 may be modified by the Company to conform with the applicable requirements of the Depositary if any of the Securities subject to such notice are then represented by one or more Global Securities. 8. Put Provisions Upon a Change of Control, then unless the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem all the Securities, any Holder of Securities will have the right to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Securities of such Holder at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date) as provided in, and subject to the terms of, the Indenture. 9. Subordination The Securities are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. To the extent provided in the Indenture, Senior Indebtedness of the Company must be paid before the Securities may be paid. The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, to the subordination provisions contained in the Indenture and authorizes the Trustee to give it effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for such purpose. -6-
10. Guaranty The payment by the Company of the principal of, and premium and interest on, the Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior subordinated basis by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. 11. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange The Securities are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before a selection of Securities to be redeemed or 15 days before an interest payment date. 12. Persons Deemed Owners The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 13. Unclaimed Money If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall pay the money back to the Company at its request unless an abandoned property law designates another Person. After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment. 14. Discharge and Defeasance Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be. 15. Amendment, Waiver Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture and the Securities may be amended or supplemented, and compliance with any provision of the Indenture may be waived, with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee shall be entitled to amend or supplement the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or to comply with Article 5 of the Indenture, or to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to add -7-
guarantees with respect to the Securities, including Subsidiary Guaranties, or to secure the Securities, or to confirm the release, termination or discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture, or to add additional covenants or surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, or to comply with any request of the SEC in connection with qualifying the Indenture under the Act, or to make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Securityholder, or to conform the text of the Indenture or the Securities to any provision in the Offering Circular in the section "Description of Notes" to the extent that such provision in the "Description of Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guarantees or the Securities. 16. Defaults and Remedies Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; (ii) default in payment of principal on the Securities at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 7 of the Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise, or failure by the Company to redeem or purchase Securities when required; (iii) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $10.0 million, provided that such acceleration is not rescinded within a period of 10 days from the occurrence of such acceleration; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (vi) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million; and (vii) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guaranties. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the Holders. 17. Trustee Dealings with the Company Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. -8-
18. No Recourse Against Others A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities. 19. Authentication This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security. 20. Abbreviations Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Securityholder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act). 21. CUSIP Numbers Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon. 22. Holders' Compliance with Registration Rights Agreement Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance hereof, acknowledges and agrees to the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement, including the obligations of the Holders with respect to a registration and the indemnification of the Company to the extent provided therein. 23. Governing Law THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
Registrar and Paying Agent
          The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar, Paying Agent or co-registrar not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent.
          The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities.
          SECTION 2.04. . Prior to each due date of the principal of and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.
Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust
          SECTION 2.05. . The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.
Securityholder Lists
          SECTION 2.06. . The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are
Transfer and Exchange
 
presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.
          SECTION 2.07. . If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
Replacement Securities
          Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
          SECTION 2.08. . Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
Outstanding Securities
          If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
          If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent is not prohibited from paying such money to the Securityholders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
          SECTION 2.09. . Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities.
Temporary Securities
          SECTION 2.10. . The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation.

The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company unless the Company directs the Trustee to deliver canceled Securities to the Company. The Company may not issue

          SECTION 2.11. . If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly mail to each Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
Defaulted Interest
          SECTION 2.12. . The Company in issuing the Securities may use numbers assigned by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures ("CUSIP") and corresponding International Securities Identification Numbers ("ISIN") (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers and corresponding "ISIN's" (if then generally in use) in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; , , that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or ISIN numbers.

          SECTION 3.02. . If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate and in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000. Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts of $1,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption.

          (e) Notwithstanding Sections 4.03(a) and (b), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness if such Indebtedness is subordinate or junior ranking in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Person, as applicable, unless such Indebtedness is Senior Subordinated Indebtedness or is expressly subordinated in right of payment to Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Person.
          SECTION 4.04. .

          SECTION 4.06. .
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock
          (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:
 
          Upon any Asset Disposition by an Oil and Gas Royalty Trust in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will apply the Net Available Cash therefrom as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3).
          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.06 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.06 exceeds $20.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.06, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
          For the purposes of this Section 4.06, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:
 
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in Section 4.06(a)(2) shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
          The requirement of Section 4.06(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed to be satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement.
          (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Securities (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 4.06(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase Securities (an "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and shall purchase Securities tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Securities (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Securities will be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Securities (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 4.06 if the Net Available Cash not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.06(a)(3)(A) or (B) is less than $20.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer.
          (c) (1) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Securities purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.06(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than
 
30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision (which at a minimum will include (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Company, the most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report, other than Current Reports describing Asset Dispositions otherwise described in the information furnished with such notice (or corresponding successor reports), (B) a description of material developments in the Company's business subsequent to the date of the latest of such Reports, and (C) if material, appropriate pro forma financial information) and all instructions and materials necessary to tender Securities pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3).
          (2) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.06(a) and (b). On such date, the Company shall also irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Securities or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Securities delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Securities, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.06.
          (3) Holders electing to have a Security purchased shall be required to surrender the Security, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Security which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased. Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part shall be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered.
          (4) At the time the Company delivers Securities to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such
 
Securities are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.06. A Security shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
          (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to this Section 4.06. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.06, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations.

          The Successor Company (if not the Company) shall be the successor to the Company and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture, and the predecessor Company, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities.

United States Code
          A Default under clauses (4), (5) or (10) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
          The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (6) or (10) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5) or (9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
          SECTION 6.02. . If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event
Acceleration
 
of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
ipso
facto
          SECTION 6.03. . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
Other Remedies
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
          SECTION 6.04. . The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities) by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default with respect to all of the Securities and its consequences (including, without limitation, waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchases of, Securities or a solicitations of consents in respect of the Securities) except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security, (ii) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to this Indenture or (iii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured and shall cease to exist, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
Waiver of Past Defaults
          SECTION 6.05. . The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
Control by Majority
 
          SECTION 6.06. . Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Securityholder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless:
Limitation on Suits
     (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing;
     (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities make a request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
     (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;
     (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
     (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.
          A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Securityholder.
          SECTION 6.07. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
          SECTION 6.08. . If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07.
Collection Suit by Trustee
          SECTION 6.09. . The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
 
          SECTION 6.10. . If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:
Priorities
     FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
     SECOND: to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and, if such money or property has been collected from a Subsidiary Guarantor, to holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case to the extent required by Articles 10 and 12;
     THIRD: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest, respectively; and
     FOURTH: to the Company.
          The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.
          SECTION 6.11. . In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the Securities.
Undertaking for Costs
          SECTION 6.12. . The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws
          SECTION 7.01. .
Duties of Trustee
          (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and
 
skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs.
          (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
     (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section;

          (h) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the provisions of the TIA.
 
          SECTION 7.02. .
Rights of Trustee
          (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document, but may accept the same as conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of such statement or the correctness of such opinions.
          (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
          (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
          (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; , , that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence.
provided
however
          (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Securities shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.
          SECTION 7.03. . The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
Individual Rights of Trustee
          SECTION 7.04. . The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in the Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication.
Trustee's Disclaimer
          SECTION 7.05. . If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such Security, if any), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is not opposed to the interests of Securityholders.
Notice of Defaults
          The Trustee shall not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any Event of Default, except failure of the Company to cause to be made any required payment to the Trustee, unless the Trustee shall be specifically notified of such default by the Company or
 
by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then outstanding by a notice delivered to the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and, in the absence of such notice, the Trustee may conclusively assume no Default exists.
          SECTION 7.06. . As promptly as practicable after each June 15 beginning with the June 15 following the date of this Indenture, and in any event prior to August 15 in each year, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of June 15 that complies with TIA  313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b).
Reports by Trustee to Holders
          A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof.
          SECTION 7.07. . The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee against any and all loss, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees) incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
Compensation and Indemnity
          To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of and interest on particular Securities.
          The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall survive the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.
 
          SECTION 7.08. . The Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
Replacement of Trustee
     (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
     (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
     (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
     (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
          If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
          A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
          If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
          SECTION 7.09. . If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.
Successor Trustee by Merger
          In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Securities so
 
authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
          SECTION 7.10. . The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA  310(a). The Trustee shall be a corporation, bank or banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any state that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trustee power and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA  310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA  310(b)(1) are met.
Eligibility; Disqualification
          SECTION 7.11. . The Trustee shall comply with TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company
          SECTION 8.01. .
Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance
          (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Securities have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c), cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
          (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Securities and this Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08 and 4.09 and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) and the limitations contained in Sections 5.01(a)(3) ("covenant defeasance option").
 
The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
          If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and 6.01(8), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
          Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
          (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive.
          SECTION 8.02. . The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if:
Conditions to Defeasance
     (1) the Company irrevocably deposits in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
     (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
     (3) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the 123-day period;

     (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940;
 
     (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;
     (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;
     (8) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the jurisdiction or organization of the Company (if other than the United States) to the effect that (A) Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for income tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance, and will be subject to income tax of such jurisdiction on the same amounts, and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and
     (9) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities as contemplated by this Article 8 have been complied with.
          Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3.
          SECTION 8.03. . The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities. Money and securities so held in trust are not subject to Article 10.
Application of Trust Money
          SECTION 8.04. . The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time.
Repayment to Company
          Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
          SECTION 8.05. . The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed
Indemnity for Government Obligations
 
against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations.
          SECTION 8.06. . If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations under their respective Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
Reinstatement
          SECTION 9.01. . Subject to Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Securityholder:
Without Consent of Holders
     (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
     (2) to comply with Article 5;
     (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; , , that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code;
provided
however
     (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Securities, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, to secure the Securities or to confirm the release, termination or discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under this Indenture;
     (5) to add to the covenants of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor;
     (6) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, this Indenture under the TIA;
     (7) to make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the rights of any Securityholder; or
 
     (8) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision in the Offering Circular in the section "Description of the Notes" to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture or the Securities.
          However, no amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of this Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor then outstanding unless such holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or its Representative) consents to such change or as otherwise permitted by the notes, debentures, bonds or other similar instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness.
          The consent of the holders of the Securities is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
          After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.01.
          SECTION 9.02. . The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities, or waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provisions hereof or thereof, without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Securities). However, without the consent of each Securityholder affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Securities held by a non-consenting Holder):
With Consent of Holders
     (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security;
     (3) reduce the principal amount of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Security;
     (4) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may be redeemed in accordance with Article 3;
     (5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
     (6) impair the right of any Securityholder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Securityholder's securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Securityholder's Securities;
 
     (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 or the second sentence of this Section 9.02;
     (8) make any change in the ranking or priority of any Security that would adversely affect the Securityholders; or
     (9) make any change in any Subsidiary Guaranty that would adversely affect the Securityholders in any material respect.
          It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
          After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02.
          SECTION 9.03. . Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
          SECTION 9.04. . A consent to an amendment, a supplement or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent, supplement or waiver is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment, a supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and any subsequent Holder of such Security or any Security that evidences all or any part of the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee.
Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers
          The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
          SECTION 9.05. . If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
 
determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
          SECTION 9.06. . The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
Trustee To Sign Amendments
          SECTION 9.07. . Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Payment for Consent
          SECTION 10.01. . The Company agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 10, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Securities shall in all respects rank with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and only Indebtedness of the Company which is Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article 10 shall be subject to Section 10.12.
Agreement To Subordinate
pari
passu
          SECTION 10.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property:
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment of principal of or interest on the Securities; and
     (2) until such Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Securityholders would be entitled but for this Article 10 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Securityholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the Securities.
 
          SECTION 10.03. . The Company shall not pay the principal of or interest on the Securities or make any deposit pursuant to Section 8.01 and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Securities (collectively, "pay the Securities") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the Securities without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the Securities for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to the Company) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be entitled to resume payments on the Securities after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. The Securities shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company
 
          SECTION 10.04. . If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or their Representatives) of the acceleration.
Acceleration of Payment of Securities
          SECTION 10.05. . If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this Article 10 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
          SECTION 10.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article 10 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the Company and Securityholders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
          SECTION 10.07. . This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
     (1) impair, as between the Company and Securityholders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms; or
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders.
          SECTION 10.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
          SECTION 10.09. . Notwithstanding Section 10.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article 10 would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 10. The Company, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 10 with respect to any Senior
 
Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 10 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07.
          SECTION 10.10. . Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
          SECTION 10.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in this Article 10 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 10 shall have any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Securities.
Article 10 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Accelerate
          SECTION 10.12. . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article 8 by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article 10, and none of the Securityholders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
          SECTION 10.13. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 10, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 10.
Trustee Entitled To Rely
          SECTION 10.14. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
 
Securityholders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in this Article 10 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
          SECTION 10.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10 or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company
          SECTION 10.16. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions
          SECTION 11.01. . Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 11 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Guaranties
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the
 
Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 11.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
          Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 11.02 and 11.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
          In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in
 
Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 11.01.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 11.01.
          SECTION 11.02. . Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Limitation on Liability
          SECTION 11.03. . This Article 11 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns
          SECTION 11.04. . Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 11 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 11 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver
          SECTION 11.05. . No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 11, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification
          SECTION 11.06. . Upon (a) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (c) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article 11 without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor
 
          SECTION 12.01. . Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 12, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guaranty of Senior Indebtedness of the Company) shall rank senior to the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.
Agreement To Subordinate
pari
passu
          SECTION 12.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property:
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Securityholders would be entitled but for this Article 12 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Securityholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as Subsidiary Guaranty.
          SECTION 12.03. . No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make its Subsidiary Guaranty or purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any Securities or other Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During
Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
 
the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to such Subsidiary Guarantor) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
          SECTION 12.04. . If a demand for payment is made on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 11, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand.
Demand for Payment
          SECTION 12.05. . If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this Article 12 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
 
          SECTION 12.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article 12 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
          SECTION 12.07. . This Article 12 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
     (1) impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article 11; or
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders.
          SECTION 12.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Subsidiary Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
          SECTION 12.09. . Notwithstanding Section 12.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 12. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 12 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 12 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07.
 
          SECTION 12.10.         . Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
          SECTION 12.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article 12 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 12 shall have any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
Article 12 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Demand Payment
          SECTION 12.12. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 12. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 12, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 12.
Trustee Entitled To Rely
          SECTION 12.13. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Securityholders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in this Article 12 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
          SECTION 12.14. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 12 or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
 
          SECTION 12.15. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantors on Subordination Provisions
          SECTION 13.01. . If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control.

          Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Securityholder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Securityholders. If a notice or
 
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.
          SECTION 13.03. . Securityholders may communicate pursuant to TIA  312(b) with other Securityholders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities.

          SECTION 13.06. . In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination.
When Securities Disregarded

After any such payment, Holders entitled to the money must look only to the Company and not to the Trustee for payment.
13.
Discharge and Defeasance
          Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Securities and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Securities to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.

15.
Defaults and Remedies
          Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Securities; (ii) default in payment of principal on the Securities at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, upon acceleration or otherwise, or failure by the Company to redeem or purchase Securities when required; (iii) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Securities, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $10.0 million, provided that such acceleration is not rescinded within a period of 10 days from the occurrence of such acceleration; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (vi) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million; and (vii) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guaranties. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities may declare all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
          Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
          
 
\
trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Securityholders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the Holders.
16.
Trustee Dealings with the Company
          Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
17.
No Recourse Against Others
          A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities.

          If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of that action together with that Board Resolution shall be set forth in an Officers' Certificate or certified by the Secretary or an
 
Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate or Company Order setting forth the terms of the series.
          The Securities shall be subordinated in right of payment to Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in Article X.
SECTION 2.02 .
Denominations
     The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.01. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of that series denominated in Dollars shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiples thereof.
SECTION 2.03
Forms Generally.
          The Securities of each series shall be in fully registered form and in substantially the form or forms (including temporary or permanent global form) established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, securities exchange rule, the Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar governing documents, agreements to which the Company is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company). A copy of the Board Resolution establishing the form or forms of Securities of any series shall be delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 2.04 for the authentication and delivery of those Securities.
          The definitive Securities of each series shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the Officers executing those Securities, as evidenced by their execution thereof.
          The Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the following form:
     "This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
SECTION 2.04 .
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating
          Two Officers of the Company shall sign the Securities of each series on behalf of the Company by manual or facsimile signature. The Company's seal, if any, shall be impressed, affixed, imprinted or reproduced on the Securities and may be in facsimile form.
 
          If an Officer of the Company whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
          A Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Trustee, which signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security has been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company delivers that Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.13 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 12.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture that Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
          At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver those Securities for original issue on a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of those Securities or pursuant to such procedures reasonably acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by Company Order. That order shall specify the amount of the Securities to be authenticated, the date on which the original issue of Securities is to be authenticated, the name or names of the initial Holder or Holders and any other terms of the Securities of that series not otherwise determined. If provided for in those procedures, that Company Order may authorize (1) authentication and delivery of Securities of that series for original issue from time to time, with certain terms (including, without limitation, the Maturity date or dates, original issue date or dates and interest rate or rates) that differ from Security to Security and (2) may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agent, which instructions shall be promptly confirmed in writing.
          If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 2.01, in authenticating those Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to those Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Company Order referred to above and the other documents required by Section 12.04), and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying on,
     (a) an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Board Resolution and, if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken pursuant thereto, as contemplated by the second to last paragraph of Section 2.01; and
     (b) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:
          (i) if the form of those Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution, as is permitted by Section 2.01, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
          (ii) if the terms of those Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution, as is permitted by Section 2.01, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
          (iii) those Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in that Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws in effect from time to time affecting the rights of creditors generally, and the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
          If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel at the time of issuance of each such Security, but that Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of the series to be issued.
          The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate those Securities if the issuance of those Securities pursuant to this Indenture would affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
          The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. Unless limited by the terms of that appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by that agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.
          Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
SECTION 2.05 .
Registrar and Paying Agent
          The Company shall maintain an office or agency for each series of Securities where Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities of that series and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar, and the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
          The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to that Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. If the Company fails to appoint or
 
maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.
          The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent.
SECTION 2.06 .
Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust
          With respect to each series of Securities, the Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders of Securities of that series or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of that series and will notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed. Upon payment over to the Trustee and upon accounting for any funds disbursed, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as Paying Agent with respect to a series of Securities, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of that series all money held by it as Paying Agent. Each Paying Agent shall otherwise comply with TIA  317(b).
SECTION 2.07 .
Holder Lists
          The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Holders of each series of Securities and shall otherwise comply with TIA  312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar with respect to a series of Securities, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders of the Securities of that series, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA  312(a).
SECTION 2.08 .
Transfer and Exchange
          Except as set forth in Section 2.17 or as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.01, when Securities of any series are presented to the Registrar with the request to register the transfer of those Securities or to exchange those Securities for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same series of like tenor and of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements and the requirements of this Indenture for those transactions are met; provided, however, that the Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or by his attorney, duly authorized in writing, on which instruction the Registrar can rely.
          To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's written request and submission of
 
the Securities (other than Global Securities). No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable on exchanges pursuant to Section 2.12, 3.07 or 9.05). The Trustee shall authenticate Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to register the transfer or exchange of (a) any Security selected for redemption in whole or in part pursuant to Article III, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part or (b) any Security during the period beginning 15 Business Days before the mailing of notice of any offer to repurchase Securities of the series required pursuant to the terms thereof or of redemption of Securities of a series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the date of mailing.
SECTION 2.09 .
Replacement Securities
          If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been destroyed, lost or stolen and the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of that Security, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security of the same series if the Trustee's requirements are met. If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay that Security. If required by the Trustee or the Company, the Holder must furnish an indemnity bond that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
          Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
SECTION 2.10 .
Outstanding Securities
          The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Security effected by the Trustee hereunder and those described in this Section 2.10 as not outstanding.
          If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
          If the principal amount of any Security is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
          A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
 
SECTION 2.11 .
Original Issue Discount, Foreign-Currency Denominated and Treasury Securities
          In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, (a) the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security shall be the principal amount thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of that determination upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02, (b) the principal amount of a Security denominated in a foreign currency shall be the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for that currency, as that rate is certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "Exchange Rate") on the date of original issuance of that Security, of the principal amount (or, in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security, the Dollar equivalent, as determined by the Company by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of original issuance of that Security, of the amount determined as provided in (a) above), of that Security and (c) Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of that other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, amendment, supplement, waiver or consent, only Securities that the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
SECTION 2.12 .
Temporary Securities
          Until definitive Securities of any series are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities, but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
SECTION 2.13 .
Cancellation
          The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange, payment or redemption or for credit against any sinking fund payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, redemption, replacement or cancellation or for credit against any sinking fund. Unless the Company shall direct in writing that canceled Securities be returned to it, after written notice to the Company all canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the usual disposal procedures of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall maintain a record of their disposal. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
SECTION 2.14 .
Payments; Defaulted Interest
          Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 2.01 with respect to the Securities of any series, interest (except defaulted interest) on any Security that is payable, and is
 
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Persons who are registered Holders of that Security at the close of business on the record date next preceding that Interest Payment Date, even if those Securities are canceled after that record date and on or before that Interest Payment Date. Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any series, the Company will pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities in Dollars. Those amounts shall be payable at the offices of the Trustee, provided that at the option of the Company, the Company may pay those amounts (1) by wire transfer with respect to Global Securities or (2) by check payable in that money mailed to a Holder's registered address with respect to any Securities.
          If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities of any series, it shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest on the defaulted interest, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities of that series and in Section 4.01. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date. At least 15 days before any special record date selected by the Company, the Company (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the expense of the Company upon 20 days' prior written notice from the Company setting forth that record date and the interest amount to be paid) shall mail to Holders of any such series of Securities a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of that interest to be paid.
SECTION 2.15 .
Persons Deemed Owners
          The Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of that Security for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on, or any Additional Amounts with respect to that Security and for all other purposes. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Agent or any authenticating agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
SECTION 2.16 .
Computation of Interest
          Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year comprising twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 2.17 .
Global Securities; Book-Entry Provisions
          If Securities of a series are issuable in global form as a Global Security, as contemplated by Section 2.01, then, notwithstanding clause (10) of Section 2.01 and the provisions of Section 2.02, any such Global Security shall represent those of the outstanding Securities of that series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges or redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee (i) in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified in that Security or in a Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.04 or (ii) otherwise in
 
accordance with written instructions or such other written form of instructions as is customary for the Depositary for that Security, from that Depositary or its nominee on behalf of any Person having a beneficial interest in that Global Security. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.04 and, if applicable, Section 2.12, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified in that Security or in the applicable Company Order. With respect to the Securities of any series that are represented by a Global Security, the Company authorizes the execution and delivery by the Trustee of a letter of representations or other similar agreement or instrument in the form customarily provided for by the Depositary appointed with respect to that Global Security. Any Global Security may be deposited with the Depositary or its nominee, or may remain in the custody of the Trustee or the Security Custodian therefor pursuant to a FAST Balance Certificate Agreement or similar agreement between the Trustee and the Depositary. If a Company Order has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 12.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.
          Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee or the Security Custodian as its custodian, or under that Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee or the Security Custodian and any agent of the Company, the Trustee or the Security Custodian as the absolute owner of that Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the registered holder of a Global Security of any series may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action that a Holder of Securities of that series is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of that series and (ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or the Security Custodian or any agent of the Company, the Trustee, or the Security Custodian from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or shall impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Security.
          Notwithstanding Section 2.08, and except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.01, transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of that Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. Securities of any series shall be transferred to all beneficial owners of a Global Security of that series in exchange for their beneficial interests in that Global Security if, and only if, either (1) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for that Global Security and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of that notice, (2) an Event of Default has occurred with respect to that series and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from the Depositary to issue Securities of that series in lieu of all or a portion of that Global Security (in which case the Company shall deliver Securities of that series within 30 days of that request) or (3) the Company determines not to have the Securities of that series represented by a Global Security.
 
          In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee on receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Securities shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Securities of the same series of like tenor and amount.
          In connection with the transfer of all the beneficial interests in a Global Security of any series to beneficial owners pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in the Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Securities of that series of authorized denominations.
          Neither the Company nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, Securities by the Depositary, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the Depositary relating to those Securities. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay by the related Global Security Holder or the Depositary in identifying the beneficial owners, and each such Person may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, instructions from that Global Security Holder or the Depositary for all purposes (including with respect to the registration and delivery, and the respective principal amounts, of the Securities to be issued).
          The provisions of the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04 shall apply to any Global Security if that Global Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Global Security together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 12.05 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the cancellation or reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of the third paragraph of Section 2.04.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.03 and 2.14, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 with respect to Securities of any series, payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to any Global Security shall be made to the Person or Persons specified therein.
SECTION 3.01 .
Applicability of Article
     Securities of any series that are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article III.
 
SECTION 3.02 .
Notice to the Trustee
          If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to this Indenture, it shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Date and principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. The Company shall so notify the Trustee at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the redemption will comply with the provisions of this Indenture and of the Securities of that series. Any such notice may be canceled at any time prior to the mailing of that notice of redemption to any Holder of the Securities of that series and shall thereupon be void and of no effect.
     SECTION 3.03 .
Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed
          If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of that series of a specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the outstanding Securities of that series (and tenor) not previously called for redemption, either pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate. That redemption may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of that series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or of the principal amount of Global Securities of that series.
          The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
          For purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any of the Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount thereof which has been or is to be redeemed.
SECTION 3.04 .
Notice of Redemption
          Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities of a series to be redeemed, at the address of that Holder appearing in the register of Securities for that series maintained by the Registrar.
          All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
     (1) the Redemption Date;
     (2) the Redemption Price;
 
     (3) that, unless the Company defaults in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only remaining right of the Holders of those Securities is to receive payment of the Redemption Price on surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities redeemed;
     (4) if any Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and that on and after the Redemption Date, on surrender for cancellation of that Security to the Paying Agent, a new Security or Securities in the aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued without charge to the Holder;
     (5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price and the name and address of the Paying Agent;
     (6) that the redemption is for a sinking or analogous fund, if that is the case; and
     (7) the CUSIP number, if any, relating to those Securities.
          Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
SECTION 3.05 .
Effect of Notice of Redemption
          Once notice of redemption is mailed, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, those Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption Price, but interest installments whose maturity is on or prior to that Redemption Date will be payable on the relevant Interest Payment Dates to the Holders of record at the close of business on the relevant record dates specified pursuant to Section 2.01.
SECTION 3.06 .
Deposit of Redemption Price
          On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 2.06) an amount of money in same day funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to, the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date, other than Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on that date which have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation.
          If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless the Company defaults in the payment of that Redemption Price, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not those Securities are presented for payment, and the Holders of those Securities shall have no further rights with
 
respect to those Securities except for the right to receive the Redemption Price on surrender of those Securities. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid on surrender thereof for redemption, the principal of and premium, if any, any Additional Amounts, and, to the extent lawful, accrued interest thereon shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate specified pursuant to Section 2.01 or provided in the Securities or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, their initial yield to maturity.
SECTION 3.07 .
Securities Redeemed or Purchased in Part
          Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Security to be redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of that Security without service charge a new Security or Securities, of the same series and of any authorized denomination as requested by that Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered that is not redeemed.
SECTION 3.08 .
Purchase of Securities
          Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company and any Affiliate of the Company may at any time purchase or otherwise acquire Securities in the open market or by private agreement. Any such acquisition shall not operate as or be deemed for any purpose to be a redemption of the indebtedness represented by those Securities. Any Securities purchased or acquired by the Company may be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and, on that cancellation, the indebtedness represented thereby shall be deemed to be satisfied. Section 2.13 shall apply to all Securities so delivered.
SECTION 3.09 .
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
          The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of the minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." Unless otherwise provided by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.10. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of that series and by this Article III.
SECTION 3.10 .
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
          The Company may deliver outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of those Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of those Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of that series required to be made pursuant to the terms of that series of Securities; provided that those Securities have not been previously so credited. Those Securities shall be received and credited for that purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified
 
in those Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund, and the amount of that sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
SECTION 3.11 .
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
          Not less than 45 days prior (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivery of or by crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.10 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Failure of the Company to timely deliver that Officers' Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute the election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for that series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of that series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to that series as provided in this Section.
          If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof based on the applicable Exchange Rate on the date of original issue of the applicable Securities) or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, that cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of that series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If that amount shall be $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) or less and the Company makes no such request, then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof as aforesaid) is available. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed on that sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.04. That notice having been duly given, the redemption of those Securities shall be made on the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 3.05, 3.06 and 3.07.
SECTION 4.01 .
Payment of Securities
          The Company shall pay the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of each series on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities of that series and in this Indenture. Principal, premium, interest and any Additional Amounts shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent, other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, holds on that date money deposited by the
 
Company designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts then due.
          The Company shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal of and premium (if any) on Securities of any series, at a rate equal to the then applicable interest rate on the Securities of that series to the extent lawful; and it shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest on and any overdue payments of Additional Amounts with respect to Securities of that series (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate to the extent lawful.
SECTION 4.02
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
          The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent) where Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series may be presented for payment and where notices and demands to or on the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. Unless otherwise designated by the Company by written notice to the Trustee, that office or agency shall be the office of the Trustee in Fort Worth, Texas, which on the date hereof is located at 505 Main Street, Suite 301, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of that office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, those presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
          The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all those purposes and may from time to time rescind those designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for those purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
SECTION 4.03 .
SEC Reports; Financial Statements
     (a) The Company shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files the same with the SEC, copies of the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports (or copies of those portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall also comply with the provisions of TIA  314(a).
     (b) If the Company is not subject to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall furnish to all Holders of Rule 144A Securities and prospective purchasers of Rule 144A Securities designated by the Holders of Rule 144A
 
Securities, promptly on their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
SECTION 4.04 .
Compliance Certificate
     (a) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, a statement signed by an Officer of the Company, which need not constitute an Officers' Certificate, complying with TIA  314(a)(4) and stating that, in the course of performance by the signing Officer of the Company of his or her duties as such Officer of the Company, he or she would normally obtain knowledge of the keeping, observing, performing and fulfilling by the Company of its obligations under this Indenture, and further stating that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the Company has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every covenant contained in this Indenture and is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof (or, if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such Defaults or Events of Default of which that Officer may have knowledge and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto).
     (b) The Company shall, so long as Securities of any series are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, promptly on any Officer of the Company becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default under this Indenture, an Officers' Certificate specifying that Default or Event of Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
SECTION 4.05 .
Existence
          Subject to Article V hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and the existence of each of its Subsidiaries and all rights (charter and statutory) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve the existence of any Subsidiary of the Company or any such right if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and that the loss thereof would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not have any material adverse effect on the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture.
SECTION 4.06 .
Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws
          The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist on, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such
 
law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
SECTION 4.07 .
Additional Amounts
          If the Securities of a series expressly provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of that series Additional Amounts as expressly provided therein. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or the net proceeds received from the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, that mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this Section 4.07 to the extent that, in that context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.07, and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where that express mention is not made.
          Unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to Securities of any series, if the Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least ten days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal and any premium is made), and at least ten days prior to each date of payment of principal and any premium or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company shall furnish the Trustee and the Company's principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether that payment of principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities of that series who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge described in the Securities of that series. If any such withholding shall be required, then that Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any, required to be withheld on those payments to those Holders of Securities, and the Company will pay to that Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by this Section. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for and to hold them harmless against any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this Section 4.07.
SECTION 5.01 .
Limitations on Mergers, Consolidations and Other Transactions
          The Company shall not, in any transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate with any other Person into, or merge into, any other Person, or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of its assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:
 
     (1) the Person formed by that consolidation or into which the Company is merged, or to which that sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition shall be made (collectively, the "Successor"), expressly assumes by supplemental indenture the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to all the Securities and the performance of the Company's covenants and obligations under this Indenture and the Securities;
     (2) immediately after giving effect to that transaction or series of related transactions, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and
     (3) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the transaction and that supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture.
SECTION 5.02 .
Successor Person Substituted
          Upon any consolidation or merger of the Company or any sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of the assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 5.01, any Successor formed by that consolidation or into or with which the Company is merged or to which that sale, lease, conveyance, transfer or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities with the same effect as if that Successor had been named as the Company herein and the predecessor Company, in the case of a sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, shall be released from all obligations under this Indenture and the Securities.
SECTION 6.01 .
Events of Default
          Unless either inapplicable to a particular series or specifically deleted or modified in or pursuant to the supplemental indenture or Board Resolution establishing that series of Securities or in the form of Security for that series, an "Event of Default," wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, occurs if:
     (1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable and that default continues for a period of 30 days;
     (2) the Company defaults in the payment of (A) the principal of any Security of that series at its Maturity or (B) premium (if any) on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable;
     (3) the Company defaults in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and that default continues for a period of 30 days;
 
     (4) the Company fails to comply with any of its other covenants or agreements in, or provisions of, the Securities of that series or this Indenture (other than an agreement, covenant or provision that has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than that series) which shall not have been remedied within the specified period after written notice, as specified in the last paragraph of this Section 6.01;
     (5) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
          (A) commences a voluntary case,
          (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case,
          (C) consents to the appointment of a Bankruptcy Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
          (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
     (6) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days and that:
          (A) is for relief against the Company as debtor in an involuntary case,
          (B) appoints a Bankruptcy Custodian of the Company or a Bankruptcy Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of the Company, or
          (C) orders the liquidation of the Company; or
     (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series occurs.
          The term "Bankruptcy Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
          The Trustee shall not be deemed to know or have notice of a Default unless a Trust Officer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee receives written notice at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee of that Default with specific reference to that Default.
          When a Default is cured, it ceases.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, if the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to any Security is payable in a currency or currencies (including a composite currency) other than Dollars and such currency or currencies are not available to the Company for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company (a "Conversion Event"), the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making that payment in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar equivalent of the amount
 
payable in such other currency, as determined by the Company by reference to the Exchange Rate on the date of that payment, or, if that rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01, any payment made under such circumstances in Dollars where the required payment is in a currency other than Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture.
          Promptly after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee; and the Trustee, promptly after receipt of that notice, shall give notice thereof in the manner provided in Section 12.02 to the Holders. Promptly after the making of any payment in Dollars as a result of a Conversion Event, the Company shall give notice in the manner provided in Section 12.02 to the Holders, setting forth the applicable Exchange Rate and describing the calculation of those payments.
          A Default under clause (4) or (7) of this Section 6.01 is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by that Default (or, in the case of a Default under clause (4) of this Section 6.01, if outstanding Securities of other series are affected by that Default, then at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities so affected) notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default, and the Company fails to cure the Default within 90 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default."
SECTION 6.02 .
Acceleration
          If an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of any series at the time outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01 hereof) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by that default (or, in the case of an Event of Default described in clause (4) of Section 6.01, if outstanding Securities of other series are affected by that Default, then at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities so affected) by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of (or, if any of those Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) and all accrued and unpaid interest on all then outstanding Securities of that series or of all series, as the case may be, to be due and payable. Upon any such declaration, the amounts due and payable on those Securities shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs, those amounts shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the series affected by that default or all series, as the case may be, by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences (other than nonpayment of principal of or premium or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series (or of all series, as the case may be) have been cured or waived, except nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or any Additional Amounts that has become due solely because of the acceleration.
 
SECTION 6.03 .
Other Remedies
          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of that series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of that series or this Indenture.
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding with respect to Securities of any series even if it does not possess any of the Securities of that series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing on an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
SECTION 6.04 .
Waiver of Defaults
          Subject to Sections 6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series or of all series (acting as one class) by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to that series or all series, as the case may be, and its consequences (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of that series or all series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of that series or all series, provided that in each case that offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of that series or all series (but the terms of that offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)), except (1) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security or (2) a continued Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended or supplemented without the consent of each Holder affected. Upon any such waiver, that Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6.05 .
Control by Majority
          With respect to Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it relating to or arising under an Event of Default described in clause (1), (2), (3) or (7) of Section 6.01, and with respect to all Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Securities affected may direct in writing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it not relating to or arising under such an Event of Default. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with applicable law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with that direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification
 
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion from Holders directing the Trustee against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking that action.
SECTION 6.06 .
Limitations on Suits
          Subject to Section 6.07 hereof, a Holder of a Security of any series may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of that series only if:
     (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to that series;
     (2) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
     (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
     (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and
     (5) during that 60-day period, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
          A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder.
SECTION 6.07 .
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to that Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in that Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after those respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
SECTION 6.08 .
Collection Suit by Trustee
          If an Event of Default specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs and is continuing with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the amount of principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts remaining unpaid on the Securities of that series, and interest on overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, interest on overdue interest, and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
SECTION 6.09 .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
          The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any committee of creditors, as may be necessary or advisable to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceeding relative to the Company or its creditors or properties and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any Bankruptcy Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make those payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of those payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders of the Securities may be entitled to receive in that proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
SECTION 6.10 .
Priorities
          If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article VI, subject to Article X, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
          First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;
     Second: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which that money has been collected, for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on those Securities for principal, premium (if any), interest and any Additional Amounts, respectively; and
          Third: to the Company.
          The Trustee, on prior written notice to the Company, may fix record dates and payment dates for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Article VI.
          To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, if for the purpose of obtaining a judgment against the Company in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in
 
accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Business Day next preceding that on which final judgment is given. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any shortfall nor shall it benefit from any windfall in payments to Holders of Securities under this Section 6.10 caused by a change in exchange rates between the time the amount of a judgment against it is calculated as above and the time the Trustee converts the Judgment Currency into the Required Currency to make payments under this Section to Holders of Securities, but payment of that judgment shall discharge all amounts owed by the Company on the claim or claims underlying that judgment.
SECTION 6.11 .
Undertaking for Costs
          In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by a Holder or Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series.
SECTION 7.01 .
Duties of Trustee
          (a) If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series, and use the same degree of care and skill in that exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
          (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series:
     (1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee shall examine those certificates and opinions to determine whether, on their face, they appear to conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
 
     (1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of Section 7.01(b);
     (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof.
          (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01.
          (e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.
          (f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. All money received by the Trustee with respect to Securities of any series shall, until applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of that series.
SECTION 7.02 .
Rights of Trustee
     (a) The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
     (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require instruction, an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both to be provided. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on that instruction, Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the written advice of that counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
     (c) The Trustee may act through agents and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent appointed with due care.
     (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers conferred on it by this Indenture.
 
     (e) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company.
SECTION 7.03 .
May Hold Securities
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or any of its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. However, the Trustee is subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
SECTION 7.04 .
Trustee's Disclaimer
          The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities; it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities or any money paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision hereof; it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee; and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.
SECTION 7.05 .
Notice of Defaults
          If a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series occurs and is continuing and it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Securities of that series a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and Additional Amounts or any sinking fund installment with respect to the Securities of that series, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders of Securities of that series.
SECTION 7.06 .
Reports by Trustee to Holders
          Within 60 days after each May 15 of each year after the execution of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of a series and the Company a brief report dated as of that reporting date that complies with TIA  313(a); provided, however, that if no event described in TIA  313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date with respect to a series, no report need be transmitted to Holders of that series. The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports if and as required by TIA  313(c) and 313(d).
          A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders of a series of Securities shall be filed by the Company with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of that series are listed. The Company shall notify the Trustee if and when any series of Securities is listed on any stock exchange.
 
SECTION 7.07 .
Compensation and Indemnity
          The Company agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company agrees to reimburse the Trustee on request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred by it. Those expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
          The Company hereby indemnifies the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, except as set forth in the next paragraph. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel, and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of that counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent.
          The Company shall not be obligated to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability incurred by the Trustee through negligence or bad faith.
          To secure the payment obligations of the Company in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series. That lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
          When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
SECTION 7.08 .
Replacement of Trustee
          A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only on the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section 7.08.
          The Trustee may resign and be discharged at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to the Securities of that series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
     (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
     (2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
 
     (3) a Bankruptcy Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
     (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
          If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of those series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series). Within one year after the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of that series may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
          If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that series.
          If the Trustee with respect to the Securities of a series fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder of Securities of that series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that series.
          In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, each such successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
          In case of the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto in which each successor Trustee shall accept that appointment and that (1) shall confer to each successor Trustee all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of that successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall confirm that all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee. Nothing herein or in that supplemental indenture shall constitute those Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, and each such Trustee shall be trustee of a
 
trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. Upon the execution and delivery of that supplemental indenture, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, and each such successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of that successor Trustee relates. On the request of the Company or any successor Trustee, that retiring Trustee shall transfer to that successor Trustee all property held by that retiring Trustee as Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of that successor Trustee relates.
          Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee or Trustees pursuant to this Section 7.08, the obligations of the Company under Section 7.07 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee or Trustees.
SECTION 7.09
Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.
          Subject to Section 7.10, if the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee; provided, however, that in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to another corporation, the transferee corporation expressly assumes all of the Trustee's liabilities hereunder.
          In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to that authenticating Trustee may adopt that authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate those Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all those cases those certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
SECTION 7.10 .
Eligibility; Disqualification
          There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and authorized under those laws to exercise corporate trust power, shall be subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State (or the District of Columbia) authority and shall have, or be a Subsidiary of a bank or bank holding company having, a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.
          The Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA  310(a)(1), 310(a)(2) and 310(a)(5). The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA  310(b) during the period of time required by this Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the SEC the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA  310(b).
 
SECTION 7.11 .
Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company
          The Trustee is subject to and shall comply with the provisions of TIA  311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated therein.
SECTION 8.01 .
Termination of Company's Obligations
          (a) This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the Securities of a series (except as to any surviving rights of conversion or of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities expressly provided for herein and except that the Company's obligations under Section 7.07, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations under Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive), and the Trustee, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series, when:
          (1) either
          (A) all outstanding Securities of that series theretofore authenticated and issued (other than destroyed, lost or stolen Securities that have been replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
          (B) all outstanding Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation:
          (i) have become due and payable, or
          (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
          (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
and, in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as funds (immediately available to the Holders in the case of clause (i)) in trust for that purpose (x) cash in an amount, or (y) Government Obligations, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of cash in an amount or (z) a combination thereof, which will be sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (y) and (z)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Securities of that series for principal and any interest and any Additional Amounts to the date of
 
that deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or for principal, premium, if any, interest and any Additional Amounts to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; or
          (C) the Company has properly fulfilled such other means of satisfaction and discharge as is specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of that series;
     (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by it hereunder with respect to the Securities of that series; and

     (1) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders of Securities of that series, (i) money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of that series is to be made in an amount, or (ii) Government Obligations with respect to that series, maturing as to principal and interest at such times and in such amounts as will ensure the availability of money in the currency in which payment of the Securities of that series is to be made in an amount or (iii) a combination thereof, that is sufficient, in the opinion (in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay, without consideration of the reinvestment of any such amounts and after payment of all taxes or other charges or assessments in respect thereof payable by the Trustee, the principal of and premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to all Securities of that series on each date that such principal, premium (if any), interest or Additional Amounts are due and payable and (at the Stated Maturity thereof or on redemption as provided in Section 8.01(e)) to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply that money and/or the proceeds of those Government Obligations to the payment of said principal, premium (if any), interest and Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of that series as the same shall become due;

          In that event, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as set forth in this paragraph), and the Trustee, on demand of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge under this Indenture. However, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 7.07, 7.08 and 8.04, the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 and the rights, powers, protections and privileges accorded the Trustee under Article VII shall survive until all Securities of that series are no longer outstanding. Thereafter, only the Company's obligations in Section 7.07 and the Trustee's and Paying Agent's obligations in Section 8.03 shall survive with respect to Securities of that series.
          After making the irrevocable deposit pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) and following satisfaction of the other conditions set forth herein, the Trustee on request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series, except for those surviving obligations specified above.

     (1) no Default or Event of Default under clauses (5) and (6) of Section 6.01 hereof shall have occurred at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the
 
date of deposit contemplated by Section 8.01(b) (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of that period);
     (2) unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of that series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect referred to in Section 8.01(b)(4) with respect to that legal defeasance, which opinion is based on (i) a private ruling of the Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Company, (ii) a published ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or (iii) a change in the applicable federal income tax law (including regulations) after the date of this Indenture;

          (d) If and to the extent additional or alternative means of satisfaction, discharge or defeasance of Securities of a series are specified to be applicable to that series as contemplated by Section 2.01, the Company may terminate any or all of its obligations under this Indenture with respect to Securities of a series and any or all of its obligations under the Securities of that series if it fulfills such other means of satisfaction and discharge as may be so specified, as contemplated by Section 2.01, to be applicable to the Securities of that series.
          (e) If Securities of any series subject to subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 8.01 are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, the terms of the applicable trust arrangement shall provide for that redemption, and the Company shall make such arrangements as are reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

SECTION 8.04 .
Reinstatement
          If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations deposited with respect to Securities of any series in accordance with Section 8.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting that application, the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series and under the Securities of that series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 8.01; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of those Securities to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or the Paying Agent.
SECTION 9.01 .
Without Consent of Holders
          The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities or waive any provision hereof or thereof without the consent of any Holder:
          (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
          (2) to comply with Section 5.01;
 
     (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities, or to provide for the issuance of bearer Securities (with or without coupons);
     (4) to provide any security for any series of Securities or to add Guarantees of any series of Securities;
     (5) to comply with any requirement in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
     (6) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities (and if those covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Securities, stating that those covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of that series), or to surrender any right or power herein conferred on the Company;
     (7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of the Securities (and, if any such Event of Default is applicable to less than all series of Securities, specifying the series to which that Event of Default is applicable);
     (8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of that amendment or supplemental indenture that is adversely affected in any material respect by that change in or elimination of that provision;
     (9) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Section 2.01;
     (10) to supplement any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Securities pursuant to Section 8.01; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of Securities of that series or any other series of Securities in any material respect; or
     (11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.08.
          Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company in the execution of any supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained.
 
SECTION 9.02 .
With Consent of Holders
          Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture with the written consent (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of any one or more series or all series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of any one or more series or all series, provided that in each case that offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of each such series (but the terms of that offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)) of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of all series affected by that amendment or supplement (acting as one class).
          Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 9.06, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 9.06, join with the Company in the execution of that amendment or supplemental indenture.
          It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if that consent approves the substance thereof.
          The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of one or more series or of all series may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture with respect to Securities of that series (including waivers obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Securities of that series or a solicitation of consents in respect of Securities of that series, provided that in each case that offer or solicitation is made to all Holders of then outstanding Securities of that series (but the terms of that offer or solicitation may vary from series to series)).
          However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not:
     (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (2) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Security;
     (3) reduce the principal of, premium on or any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to, or change the Stated Maturity of, any Security or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable on a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02;
     (4) reduce the premium, if any, payable on the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may or shall be redeemed;
     (5) change any obligation of the Company to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any Security;
 
     (6) change the coin or currency or currencies (including composite currencies) in which any Security or any premium, interest or Additional Amounts with respect thereto are payable;
     (7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security pursuant to Sections 6.07 and 6.08, except as limited by Section 6.06;
     (8) make any change in the percentage of principal amount of Securities necessary to waive compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture pursuant to Section 6.04 or 6.07 or make any change in this sentence of Section 9.02;
     (9) modify the provisions of this Indenture with respect to the subordination of any Security in a manner adverse to the Holder thereof; or
     (10) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities.
          An amendment under this Section may not make any change that adversely affects the rights under Article X of any holder of an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company unless the holders of the issue pursuant to its terms consent to the change.
          A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series with respect to that covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
          The right of any Holder to participate in any consent required or sought pursuant to any provision of this Indenture (and the obligation of the Company to obtain any such consent otherwise required from that Holder) may be subject to the requirement that such Holder shall have been the Holder of record of any Securities with respect to which that consent is required or sought as of a date identified by the Company in a notice furnished to Holders in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
          After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of each Security affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail that notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 9.03
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
          Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply in form and substance with the TIA as then in effect.
 
SECTION 9.04 .
Revocation and Effect of Consents
          Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his or her Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
          The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date (which need not comply with Section 316(c) of the TIA) for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver or to take any other action under this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at that record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to that amendment, supplement or waiver or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not those Persons continue to be Holders after that record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after that record date unless consents from Holders of the principal amount of Securities required hereunder for that amendment or waiver to be effective shall have also been given and not revoked within that 90-day period.
          After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it is of the type described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 9.02 hereof. In that case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security.
SECTION 9.05 .
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
          If an amendment or supplement changes the terms of an outstanding Security, the Company may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security at the request of the Company regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of that amendment or supplement.
          Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any amendment or supplement may, and shall if required by the Company, bear a notation in form approved by the Company as to any matter provided for in that amendment or supplement.
SECTION 9.06
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
          The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplement authorized pursuant to this Article if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it. In signing or refusing to sign that amendment or supplement, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and,
 
subject to Section 7.01 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying on, an Opinion of Counsel provided at the expense of the Company as conclusive evidence that such amendment or supplement is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will be valid and binding on the Company in accordance with its terms.
SECTION 10.01 .
Securities Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness
          The Company and each Holder of a Security, by his or her acceptance thereof, agree that (a) the payment of the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to each and all the Securities and (b) any other payment in respect of the Securities, including on account of the acquisition or redemption of Securities by the Company, is subordinated, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article X, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed, and that these subordination provisions are for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
          Each Holder of a Security, by his or her acceptance thereof, acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article X are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to all Persons who, in reliance on such provisions, become holders of, or continue to hold, Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and such provisions are made for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and those holders are made obligees hereunder, and any one or more of them may enforce such provisions.
SECTION 10.02 .
No Payment on Securities in Certain Circumstances
     (a) Unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 2.01, no payment shall be made by or on behalf of the Company on account of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series or to acquire any of those Securities (including any repurchases of those Securities pursuant to the provisions thereof at the option of the Holder of those Securities) for cash or property (other than Junior securities of the Company), or on account of any redemption provisions of those Securities, in the event of default in payment of any principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness of the Company when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise (a "Payment Default"), unless and until that Payment Default has been cured or waived or otherwise has ceased to exist.
     (b) Unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 2.01, no payment shall be made by or on behalf of the Company on account of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of any series or to acquire any of those Securities (including any repurchases of those Securities pursuant to the provisions thereof at the option of the
 
Holder of those Securities) for cash or property (other than Junior securities of the Company), or on account of the redemption provisions of those Securities, in the event of any event of default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness permitting the holders of that Designated Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or other representative on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare that Designated Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, on written notice thereof to the Company and the Trustee by any holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee or other representative on behalf of the holders thereof) (the "Payment Blocking Notice"), unless and until that event of default shall have been cured or waived or otherwise has ceased to exist; provided, that such payments may not be prevented pursuant to this Section 10.02(b) for more than 179 days after an applicable Payment Blocking Notice has been received by the Trustee unless the Designated Senior Indebtedness in respect of which that event of default exists has been declared due and payable in its entirety, in which case no such payment may be made until that acceleration has been rescinded or annulled or that Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full. Unless otherwise specified with respect to Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 2.01, no event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of any Payment Blocking Notice (whether or not that event of default is on the same issue of Designated Senior Indebtedness) may be made the basis for the giving of a second Payment Blocking Notice, and only one such Payment Blocking Notice may be given in any period of 365 consecutive days.
     (c) In furtherance of the provisions of Section 10.01, in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.02, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company (other than Junior securities of the Company) shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities of any series or any Paying Agent with respect thereto at a time when that payment or distribution was prohibited by the provisions of this Section 10.02, then, unless that payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by this Section 10.02, that payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of Section 10.07) shall be received and held in trust by the Trustee or such Holders or Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and shall be paid or delivered by the Trustee or such Holders or Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid or unprovided for or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing that Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued, ratably, according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of that Senior Indebtedness of the Company held or represented by each, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company in full after giving effect to all concurrent payments and distributions to or for the holders of that Senior Indebtedness.
SECTION 10.03 .
Securities Subordinated to Prior Payment of All Senior Indebtedness on Dissolution, Liquidation or Reorganization
          Upon any distribution of assets of the Company or upon any dissolution, winding up, total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or
 
similar proceeding or upon assignment for the benefit of creditors:
     (a) the holders of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be entitled to receive payments in full before the Holders of Securities of any series are entitled to receive any payment (other than in the form of Junior securities of the Company) on account of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to those Securities;
     (b) any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than Junior securities of the Company), to which the Holders of Securities of any series or the Trustee on behalf of those Holders would be entitled, except for the provisions of this Article X, shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such a payment or distribution directly to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness or their representative, ratably according to the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all that Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to all concurrent payments and distributions to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness; and
     (c) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than Junior securities of the Company), shall be received by the Trustee or the Holders of Securities of any series or any Paying Agent with respect thereto (or, if the Company or any Affiliate of the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for any such payment or distribution shall be segregated or held in trust) on account of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of that series before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, that payment or distribution (subject to the provisions of Section 10.07) shall be received and held in trust by the Trustee or such Holder or Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of that Senior Indebtedness, or their respective representatives, ratably according to the respective amounts of that Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment as provided herein of all that Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to all concurrent payments and distributions and all provisions therefor to or for the holders of that Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that as to any holder of that Senior Indebtedness, as promptly as practical following notice from the Trustee to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness that such prohibited payment has been received by the Trustee, Holder(s) or Paying Agent (or has been segregated as provided above), that holder (or a representative therefor) notifies the Trustee of the amounts then due and owing on that Senior Indebtedness, if any, held by that holder, and only the amounts specified in those notices to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness.
SECTION 10.04 .
Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness
          Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided herein, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated (to the extent of the payments
 
or distributions made to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this Article X) to the rights of the holders of that Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets of the Company applicable to that Senior Indebtedness until all amounts owing on the Securities shall be paid in full. For the purpose of that subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the holders of that Senior Indebtedness by the Company, or by or on behalf of the Holders of the Securities by virtue of this Article X, which otherwise would have been made to those Holders shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and those Holders, be deemed to be payment by the Company or on account of that Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Article X are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of that Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
          If any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the Securities would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this Article X shall have been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Article X, to the payment of amounts payable under Senior Indebtedness of the Company, then those Holders shall be entitled to receive from the holders of that Senior Indebtedness any payments or distributions received by those holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company in excess of the amount sufficient to pay all amounts payable under or in respect of that Senior Indebtedness in full.
SECTION 10.05 .
Obligations of the Company Unconditional
          Nothing contained in this Article X or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company and the Holders of the Securities of any series, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to those Holders the principal of, premium (if any) and interest on and any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of those Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law on default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article X, of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received on the exercise of any such remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article X or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities, on any distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article X, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely on any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to those Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in that distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article X so long as that court has been apprised of the provisions of, or the order, decree or certificate makes reference to, the provisions of this Article X.
 
SECTION 10.06 .
Trustee Entitled to Assume Payments Not Prohibited in Absence of Notice
          The Trustee shall not at any time be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or any Paying Agent shall have received, no later than two Business Days prior to that payment, written notice thereof from the Company or from one or more holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or from any representative therefor and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02, shall be entitled in all respects conclusively to assume that no such fact exists.
SECTION 10.07 .
Application by Trustee of Amounts Deposited with It
          Amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee pursuant to and in accordance with Article VIII shall be for the sole benefit of Holders of the Securities of the series for the benefit of which those amounts were deposited, and, to the extent allocated for the payment of Securities of that series, shall not be subject to the subordination provisions of this Article X. Otherwise, any deposit of assets with the Trustee or the Paying Agent (whether or not in trust) for the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Securities shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 10.01, 10.02, 10.03 and 10.04; provided that if prior to two Business Days preceding the date on which by the terms of this Indenture any such assets may become distributable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of either principal of, premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to any Security), the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall not have received with respect to those assets the written notice provided for in Section 10.06, then the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall have full power and authority to receive those assets and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it on or after that date; and provided further that nothing contained in this Article X shall prevent the Company from making, or the Trustee from receiving or applying, any payment in connection with the redemption of Securities if the first publication of notice of that redemption (whether by mail or otherwise in accordance with this Indenture) has been made, and the Trustee has received that payment from the Company, prior to the occurrence of any of the contingencies specified in Section 10.02 or 10.03.
SECTION 10.08 .
Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of the Company or Holders of Senior Indebtedness
          No right of any present or future holders of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination provisions contained in this Article X shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may extend, renew, modify or amend the terms of the Senior Indebtedness or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange that security and otherwise deal freely with the Company, all without affecting the liabilities and obligations of the parties to this Indenture or the Holders of the Securities.
 
SECTION 10.09 .
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of Securities
          Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provisions contained in this Article X and to protect the rights of the Holders of the Securities pursuant to this Indenture, and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for that purpose, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors of the Company), the filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of his Securities in the form required in said proceedings and cause said claim to be approved. If the Trustee does not file a proper claim or proof of debt in the form required in that proceeding prior to 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim or claims, then the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative is hereby authorized to have the right to file and is hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of said Securities. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of Securities any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee or the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of the Securities in any such proceeding.
SECTION 10.10 .
Right of Trustee to Hold Senior Indebtedness
          The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all of the rights set forth in this Article X in respect of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company at any time held by it to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and nothing in this Indenture shall be construed to deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
SECTION 10.11 .
Article X Not to Prevent Events of Default
          The failure to make a payment on account of principal of or premium (if any) or interest on or any Additional Amounts with respect to the Securities by reason of any provision of this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 or in any way prevent the Holders of the Securities from exercising any right hereunder other than the right to receive payment on the Securities.
SECTION 10.12 .
No Fiduciary Duty of Trustee to Holders of Senior Indebtedness
          The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and shall not be liable to any of those holders (other than for its willful misconduct or gross negligence) if it shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders of the Securities or the Company or any other Person, cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article X or otherwise. Nothing in this Section 10.12 shall affect the obligation of any other such Person to hold that payment for the benefit of, and to pay that payment over to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative.
 
SECTION 10.13 .
Article Applicable to Paying Agent
          In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article X shall in that case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including that Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if that Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that this Section 10.13 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or that Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.
          Any series of Securities may be guaranteed by one or more of the guarantors. The terms and the form of any such Guarantee will be established in the manner contemplated by Section 2.01 for that particular series of Securities.
SECTION 12.01 .
Trust Indenture Act Controls
          If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of TIA  318(c), the imposed duties shall control.
SECTION 12.02 .

          Any notice or communication by the Company or the Trustee to the other is duly given if in writing and delivered in person or mailed by first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, facsimile or overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the other's address:

     Upon any Asset Disposition by an Oil and Gas Royalty Trust in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will apply the Net Available Cash therefrom as provided in Section 4.11(a)(3).
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.11 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.11 exceeds $20.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.11, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
     For the purposes of this Section 4.11, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:
     (1) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guaranty) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to (1) a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (2) an assignment agreement that includes, in lieu of such a release, the agreement of the transferee or its parent company to indemnify and hold harmless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from and against any loss, liability or cost in respect of such assumed liability (, , that such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) shall have an Investment Grade Rating (with no indication of a negative outlook or credit watch with negative implications, in any case, that contemplates such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) failing to have an Investment Grade Rating) at the time the indemnity is entered into);
provided

     (2) any non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that is converted, monetized, sold or exchanged by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or cash equivalents within 120 days of receipt.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in Section 4.11(a)(2) shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
     The requirement of Section 4.11(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed to be satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement.
 
          (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 4.11(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase Notes (an "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and shall purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 4.11 if the Net Available Cash not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.11(a)(3)(A) or (B) is less than $20.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer.
          (c) (1) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Notes purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.11(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision (which at a minimum will include (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Company, the most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report, other than Current Reports describing Asset Dispositions otherwise described in the information furnished with such notice (or corresponding successor reports), (B) a description of material developments in the Company's business subsequent to the date of the latest of such Reports, and (C) if material, appropriate pro forma financial information) and all instructions and materials necessary to tender Notes pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3).
     (2) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.11(a) and (b). On such date, the Company shall also irrevocably deposit with the
 
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.11.
     (3) Holders electing to have a Note purchased shall be required to surrender the Note, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased. Holders whose Notes are purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.
     (4) At the time the Company delivers Notes to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.11. A Note shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
          (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.11. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.11, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations.

     (1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate;
     (2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $10.0 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and a majority of the non-employee directors of the Company disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and have approved the relevant Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and
     (3) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $25.0 million, the Board of Directors shall also have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or is not less favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate.
     (b) Section 4.12(a) will not prohibit:
     (1) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited to be made pursuant to Section 4.09;

     (6) reasonable fees and reasonable compensation paid to, and indemnity and similar arrangements provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company's senior management; and

Change of Control

     (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture;
     (2) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
     (3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.08(a);
     (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; and
 
     (5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such transaction and will not be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such transaction had not occurred;
provided, however, that Section 5.01(a)(3) will not be applicable to (A) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into, conveying, transferring or leasing all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor, or (B) the Company merging with an Affiliate of the Company solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction within the United States of America or (C) at a time when the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants.
     For purposes of this Section 5.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
     The Successor Company (if not the Company) shall be the successor to the Company and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture, and the predecessor Company, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.
     (b) The Company shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless: (1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than Encore Operating, L.P. and any Subsidiary Guarantor that directly or indirectly holds an equity interest in Encore Operating, L.P.) that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets, if in connection therewith the Company complies with its obligations under Section 4.11 in respect of such disposition, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Subsidiary) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary was organized or under the laws of the United States of America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and, if such Person is not already a Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary, if any, under its Subsidiary Guaranty; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (3) in the event a Guaranty Agreement is executed and delivered pursuant to clause (1) above, the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with the Indenture.
 
SECTION 5.01.
Amendment of Section 6.01 of the Original Indenture.
     Section 6.01 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
     SECTION 6.01. . An "Event of Default" occurs if:
Events of Default
     (1) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Note when the same becomes due and payable, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by Article X of the Indenture, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;
     (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any Note when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, whether or not such payment shall be prohibited by Article X of the Indenture;
     (3) the Company fails to comply with Section 5.01 of the Indenture;
     (4) the Company fails to comply with Section 4.03, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, or 4.15 (other than a failure to purchase Notes when required under Section 4.11 or 4.13) and such failure continues for 30 days after the notice specified below;
     (5) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor fails to comply with any of its agreements in the Indenture (other than those referred to in clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after the notice specified below;
     (6) Indebtedness of the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $10.0 million; provided, that if such default is cured or waived or any such acceleration is rescinded, or such Indebtedness is repaid, within a period of 10 days from the continuance of such default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default and any consequential acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded, so long as such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree;
     (7) the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
 
     (8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;
     (9) any judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million above the coverage under applicable insurance policies and indemnities as to which the relevant insurer or indemnitor has not disclaimed responsibility is entered against the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary, remains outstanding for a period of 60 consecutive days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the "judgment default provision"); or
     (10) a Subsidiary Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Subsidiary Guaranty) for five days after notice or a Subsidiary Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty (the "Guaranty Failure Provision").
     The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
     The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
     A Default under clauses (4), (5) or (10) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
     The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (6) or (10) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5) or (9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
SECTION 5.02.
Amendment of Section 6.02 of the Original Indenture.
     Section 6.02 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
     SECTION 6.02. . If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) of the Indenture with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) of the Indenture with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Notes shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

     Article VIII of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
SECTION 8.01. .
Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance
     (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Notes (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Indenture) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Notes have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article III of the Indenture and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Notes, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Indenture), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then the Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c) of the Indenture, cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
     (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02 of the Indenture, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.03, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14 of the Indenture and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture, with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) and the limitations contained in Sections 5.01(a)(3) of the Indenture ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
     If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and 6.01(8) of the Indenture, with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3) of the Indenture. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
     Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.

survive until the Notes have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 of the Indenture shall survive.
SECTION 8.02. . The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if:
Conditions to Defeasance

     (3) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) of the Indenture with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the 123-day period;
     (4) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement binding on the Company and is not prohibited by Article X;
     (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940;
     (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;
     (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;
     (8) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the jurisdiction or organization of the Company (if other than the United States) to the effect that (A) Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for income tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance, and will be subject to income tax of such jurisdiction on the same amounts, and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and
 
     (9) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Notes as contemplated by this Article VIII have been complied with.

Repayment to Company
     Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
SECTION 8.05. . The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations.
Indemnity for Government Obligations
SECTION 8.06. . If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations under their respective Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article VIII until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
Reinstatement

SECTION 9.01. . Subject to Section 9.02 of the Indenture, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Notes without notice to or consent of any Holder:
Without Consent of Holders
     (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
     (2) to comply with Article V of the Indenture;
     (3) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; provided, however, that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code;
     (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, to secure the Notes or to confirm the release, termination or discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture;
     (5) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, the Indenture under the TIA;

(7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to the Notes;
     (8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only where there is no outstanding Note that is adversely affected in any material respect by that change in or elimination of that provision;
     (9) to supplement any of the provisions of the Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Notes pursuant to Article VIII; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holder of any Notes in any material respect;

     (11) to make any change to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision in the Prospectus Supplement in the section "Description of the Notes" that does not adversely affect the Holder of any Note.
     However, no amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of the Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor then outstanding unless such holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or its Representative) consents to such change or as otherwise permitted by the notes, debentures, bonds or other similar instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness.
 
     The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
     After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.01.

However, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

     After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02.

Payment for Consent
     Article X of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:

     (2) until such Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article X shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the Notes.
SECTION 10.03. . The Company shall not pay the principal of or interest on the Notes or make any deposit pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Indenture and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes (collectively, "pay the Notes") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the Notes without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the Notes for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to the Company) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be entitled to resume payments on the Notes after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. The Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period
Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company
 
by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
SECTION 10.04. . If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or their Representatives) of the acceleration.
Acceleration of Payment of Notes
SECTION 10.05. . If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article X should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
SECTION 10.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article X to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
SECTION 10.07. . This Article X defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in the Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
     (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms; or
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders.
SECTION 10.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with the Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
SECTION 10.09. . Notwithstanding Section 10.03 of the Indenture, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the Notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article X would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article X. The Company, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article X with respect to any Senior
 
Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article VII of the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article X shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 of the Indenture.
SECTION 10.10. . Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
SECTION 10.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Notes by reason of any provision in this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article X shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Notes.
Article X Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Accelerate
SECTION 10.12. . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article VIII of the Indenture by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article X, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
SECTION 10.13. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article X, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.02 of the Indenture are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article X. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article X, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article X, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Indenture shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article X.
Trustee Entitled To Rely
SECTION 10.14. . Each Holder by accepting a Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in this Article X and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
 
SECTION 10.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article X or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company
SECTION 10.16. . Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions
. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Notes when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Original Indenture (other than obligations solely with respect to Securities other than the Notes), this First Supplemental Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Original Indenture (other than obligations solely with respect to Securities other than the Notes), this First Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 10 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
SECTION 10.01.
Guaranties
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under the Original Indenture, this First Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Original Indenture, this First Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 10.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor
 
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
     Except as expressly set forth in Section 8.01(b) of the Indenture and Sections 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Original Indenture, this First Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
     In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI of the Indenture for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article VI of the Indenture, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 10.01.
 
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.
. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
SECTION 10.02.
Limitation on Liability
. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in the Original Indenture, this First Supplemental Indenture and in the Notes shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
SECTION 10.03.
Successors and Assigns
. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
SECTION 10.04.
No Waiver
. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
SECTION 10.05.
Modification
. Upon (a) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (c) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article 10 without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
SECTION 10.06.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by such Subsidiary
SECTION 11.01.
Agreement To Subordinate.
 
Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 11, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guaranty of Senior Indebtedness of the Company) shall rank senior to the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.
. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property:
SECTION 11.02.
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article 11 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders may receive shares of stock and any debt Notes of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as Subsidiary Guaranty.
. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make its Subsidiary Guaranty or purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any Notes or other Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs: (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to such Subsidiary Guarantor) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or
SECTION 11.03.
Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
 
Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
. If a demand for payment is made on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 10, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand.
SECTION 11.04.
Demand for Payment
. If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article 11 should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear.
SECTION 11.05.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
. After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article 11 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Holders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
SECTION 11.06.
Subrogation
. This Article 11 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
SECTION 11.07.
Relative Rights
     (1) impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Holders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article 10; or
 
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders.
. No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Subsidiary Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
SECTION 11.08.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
. Notwithstanding Section 11.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 11. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
SECTION 11.09.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 11 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article VII of the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 of the Indenture.
. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
SECTION 11.10.
Distribution or Notice to Representative
. The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article 11 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 11 shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
SECTION 11.11.
Article 11 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Demand Payment
. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
SECTION 11.12.
Trustee Entitled To Rely
 
holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 11. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 11, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Indenture shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 11.
. Each Holder by accepting a Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in this Article 11 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
SECTION 11.13.
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 11 or otherwise.
SECTION 11.14.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the Holders.

Trustee Dealings with the Company
     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
17.
No Recourse Against Others
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

     Upon any Asset Disposition by an Oil and Gas Royalty Trust in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary owns Capital Stock, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will apply the Net Available Cash therefrom as provided in Section 4.11(a)(3).
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.11, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this Section 4.11 except to the extent that the aggregate Net Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with this Section 4.11 exceeds $20.0 million. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this Section 4.11, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
     For the purposes of this Section 4.11, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents:
     (1) any liabilities, as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guaranty) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to (1) a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (2) an assignment agreement that includes, in lieu of such a release, the agreement of the transferee or its parent company to indemnify and hold harmless the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from and against any loss, liability or cost in respect of such assumed liability (, , that such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) shall have an Investment Grade Rating (with no indication of a negative outlook or credit watch with negative implications, in any case, that contemplates such indemnifying party (or its long-term debt securities) failing to have an Investment Grade Rating) at the time the indemnity is entered into);
provided
however
     (2) any non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that is converted, monetized, sold or exchanged by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or cash equivalents within 120 days of receipt.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 75% limitation referred to in Section 4.11(a)(2) shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any Asset Disposition in which the cash or cash equivalents portion of the consideration received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing provision on an after-tax basis, is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Disposition complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation.
     The requirement of Section 4.11(a)(3)(B) shall be deemed to be satisfied if an agreement (including a lease, whether a capital lease or an operating lease) committing to make the acquisitions or expenditures referred to therein is entered into by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary within the time period specified in such clause and such Net Available Cash is subsequently applied in accordance with such agreement within six months following such agreement.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     (b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to Section 4.11(a)(3)(C), the Company shall make such offer to purchase Notes (an "Offer") on or before the 366th day after the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, and shall purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (and such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof) without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest (or, in respect of such other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, such lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in this Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Company will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of $1,000 principal amount or multiples thereof. The Company shall not be required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company) pursuant to this Section 4.11 if the Net Available Cash not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.11(a)(3)(A) or (B) is less than $20.0 million (which lesser amount shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). Upon completion of such an offer to purchase, Net Available Cash will be deemed to be reduced by the aggregate amount of such offer.
     (c) (1) Promptly, and in any event within 10 days after the Company becomes obligated to make an Offer, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee and send, by first-class mail to each Holder, a written notice stating that the Holder may elect to have his Notes purchased by the Company either in whole or in part (subject to prorating as described in Section 4.11(b) in the event the Offer is oversubscribed) in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount, at the applicable purchase price. The notice shall specify a purchase date not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice (the "Purchase Date") and shall contain such information concerning the business of the Company which the Company in good faith believes will enable such Holders to make an informed decision (which at a minimum will include (A) the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (including audited consolidated financial statements) of the Company, the most recent subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed subsequent to such Quarterly Report, other than Current Reports describing Asset Dispositions otherwise described in the information furnished with such notice (or corresponding successor reports), (B) a description of material developments in the Company's business subsequent to the date of the latest of such Reports, and (C) if material, appropriate pro forma financial information) and all instructions and materials necessary to tender Notes pursuant to the Offer, together with the information contained in clause (3).
     (2) Not later than the date upon which written notice of an Offer is delivered to the Trustee as provided below, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate as to (A) the amount of the Offer (the "Offer Amount"), including information as to any other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness included in the Offer, (B) the allocation of the Net Available Cash from the Asset Dispositions pursuant to which such Offer is being made and (C) the compliance of such allocation with the provisions of Section 4.11(a) and (b). On such date, the Company shall also irrevocably deposit with the
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust) in Temporary Cash Investments, maturing on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or on the Purchase Date if funds are immediately available by open of business, an amount equal to the Offer Amount to be held for payment in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If the Offer includes other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, the deposit described in the preceding sentence may be made with any other paying agent pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee. Upon the expiration of the period for which the Offer remains open (the "Offer Period"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes or portions thereof which have been properly tendered to and are to be accepted by the Company. The Trustee shall, on the Purchase Date, mail or deliver payment (or cause the delivery of payment) to each tendering Holder in the amount of the purchase price. In the event that the aggregate purchase price of the Notes delivered by the Company to the Trustee is less than the Offer Amount applicable to the Notes, the Trustee shall deliver the excess to the Company immediately after the expiration of the Offer Period for application in accordance with this Section 4.11.
     (3) Holders electing to have a Note purchased shall be required to surrender the Note, with an appropriate form duly completed, to the Company at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the Purchase Date. Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Trustee or the Company receives not later than one Business Day prior to the Purchase Date, a telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note which was delivered for purchase by the Holder and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased. Holders whose Notes are purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.
     (4) At the time the Company delivers Notes to the Trustee which are to be accepted for purchase, the Company shall also deliver an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes are to be accepted by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.11. A Note shall be deemed to have been accepted for purchase at the time the Trustee, directly or through an agent, mails or delivers payment therefor to the surrendering Holder.
          (d) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this Section 4.11. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this Section 4.11, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations.
SECTION 4.12 .

          (a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, employee compensation arrangements or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (an "Affiliate Transaction") unless:
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     (1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate;
     (2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $10.0 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are set forth in writing and a majority of the non-employee directors of the Company disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and have approved the relevant Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and
     (3) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $25.0 million, the Board of Directors shall also have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or is not less favorable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate.
     (b) Section 4.12(a) will not prohibit:
     (1) any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited to be made pursuant to Section 4.09;

     (5) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company;
     (6) reasonable fees and reasonable compensation paid to, and indemnity and similar arrangements provided on behalf of, officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Company's senior management; and
     (7) any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date or any renewals, extensions or replacements of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or replacements are not less favorable to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries than
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
the original agreement in effect on the Issue Date) and the transactions evidenced thereby.
SECTION 4.13 .
Change of Control
          (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, then unless the Company shall have exercised its right to redeem all the Notes, each Holder shall have the right to cause the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the terms contemplated in Section 4.13(b). In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company (including the Revolving Credit Facility) restrict or prohibit the repurchase of Notes following such Change of Control, then prior to the mailing of the notice to Holders provided for in Section 4.13(b) below but in any event within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company shall (1) repay in full all such Senior Indebtedness or (2) obtain the requisite consents under the agreements governing such Senior Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the Notes as provided for in Section 4.13(b).

     (f) The Company shall comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes as a result of a Change of Control.

     The Successor Company (if not the Company) shall be the successor to the Company and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture, and the predecessor Company, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.

     (7) the Company, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency;

or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;
     (9) any judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million above the coverage under applicable insurance policies and indemnities as to which the relevant insurer or indemnitor has not disclaimed responsibility is entered against the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary, remains outstanding for a period of 60 consecutive days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the "judgment default provision"); or

Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
     The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (6) or (10) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5) or (9), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) of the Indenture with respect to the Company occurs, the principal of and interest on all the Notes shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     Article VIII of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
SECTION 8.01. .
Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance
     (a) When (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Notes (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Indenture) for cancellation or (2) all outstanding Notes have become due and payable, whether at maturity or on a redemption date as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article III of the Indenture and the Company irrevocably deposits with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Notes, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Notes replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Indenture), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then the Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.01(c) of the Indenture, cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
     (b) Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02 of the Indenture, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.03, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14 of the Indenture and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and (8) of the Indenture, with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) and the limitations contained in Sections 5.01(a)(3) of the Indenture ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
     If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(6), 6.01(7), 6.01(8) and 6.01(9) of the Indenture (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(7) and 6.01(8) of the Indenture, with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries and Subsidiary Guarantors) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3) of the Indenture. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
     Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
     (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 2.10, 7.07 and 7.08 of the Indenture and in this Article VIII shall
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
survive until the Notes have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 of the Indenture shall survive.
SECTION 8.02. . The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if:

     (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
     (3) 123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(7) or (8) of the Indenture with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the 123-day period;
     (4) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement binding on the Company and is not prohibited by Article X;
     (5) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940;
     (6) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;
     (7) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred;
     (8) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the jurisdiction or organization of the Company (if other than the United States) to the effect that (A) Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for income tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance, and will be subject to income tax of such jurisdiction on the same amounts, and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     (9) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Notes as contemplated by this Article VIII have been complied with.
     Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Notes at a future date in accordance with Article III of the Indenture.
SECTION 8.03. . The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article VIII. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations through the Paying Agent and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes. Money and securities so held in trust are not subject to Article X.
Application of Trust Money
SECTION 8.04. . The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time.
Repayment to Company
     Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years, and, thereafter, Holders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
SECTION 8.05. . The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations.
Indemnity for Government Obligations
SECTION 8.06. . If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations under their respective Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article VIII until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII; provided, however, that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
Reinstatement
SECTION 8.01.
Amendment of Section 9.01 of the Original Indenture.
     Section 9.01 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
SECTION 9.01. . Subject to Section 9.02 of the Indenture, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Notes without notice to or consent of any Holder:
Without Consent of Holders
     (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
     (2) to comply with Article V of the Indenture;
          (3) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; provided, however, that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code;
          (4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, to secure the Notes or to confirm the release, termination or discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture;
          (5) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, the Indenture under the TIA;
          (6) to add to the covenants of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor;
          (7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to the Notes;
          (8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only where there is no outstanding Note that is adversely affected in any material respect by that change in or elimination of that provision;
          (9) to supplement any of the provisions of the Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Notes pursuant to Article VIII; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holder of any Notes in any material respect;
          (10) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor trustee with respect to the Notes and to add or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the Indenture by more than one trustee; or
          (11) to make any change to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision in the Prospectus Supplement in the section "Description of the Notes" that does not adversely affect the Holder of any Note.
     However, no amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of the Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor then outstanding unless such holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or its Representative) consents to such change or as otherwise permitted by the notes, debentures, bonds or other similar instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.
     After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.01.
SECTION 8.02.
Amendment of Section 9.02 of the Original Indenture.
     Section 9.02 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
SECTION 9.02. . The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes, or waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provisions hereof or thereof, without notice to any Holder but with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Notes). However, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
With Consent of Holders
     (1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (2) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
     (3) reduce the principal amount of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note;
          (4) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed in accordance with Article III of the Indenture;
     (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
          (6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder's securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
     (7) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 of the Indenture or the second sentence of this Section 9.02;
     (8) make any change in the ranking or priority of any Note that would adversely affect the Holders;
     (9) waive a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal on, premium (if any) or interest on the Notes; or
     (10) make any change in any Subsidiary Guaranty that would adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such amendment, supplement or waiver. The failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02.
SECTION 8.03.
Addition of Section 9.07.
     Article IX of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to add the following at the end thereof:
SECTION 9.07. .

Payment for Consent
     Article X of the Original Indenture is hereby amended, solely as it applies to the Notes, to read as follows:
SECTION 10.01. . The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article X, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Notes shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and only Indebtedness of the Company which is Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall rank senior to the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article X shall be subject to Section 10.12 of the Indenture.
Agreement To Subordinate
SECTION 10.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property:
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment of principal of or interest on the Notes; and
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     (2) until such Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article X shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as the Notes.
SECTION 10.03. . The Company shall not pay the principal of or interest on the Notes or make any deposit pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Indenture and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes (collectively, "pay the Notes") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the Notes without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the Notes for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to the Company) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, the Company shall be entitled to resume payments on the Notes after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. The Notes shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period
Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
SECTION 10.04. . If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or their Representatives) of the acceleration.
Acceleration of Payment of Notes
SECTION 10.05. . If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article X should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
SECTION 10.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article X to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
SECTION 10.07. . This Article X defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in the Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
          (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms; or
          (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders.
SECTION 10.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by its failure to comply with the Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
SECTION 10.09. . Notwithstanding Section 10.03 of the Indenture, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on the Notes and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that under this Article X would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article X. The Company, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article X with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
Indebtedness; and nothing in Article VII of the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article X shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 of the Indenture.
SECTION 10.10. . Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
SECTION 10.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Notes by reason of any provision in this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article X shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Notes.
Article X Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Accelerate
SECTION 10.12. . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust under Article VIII of the Indenture by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article X, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
SECTION 10.13. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article X, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.02 of the Indenture are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (3) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article X. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article X, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article X, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Indenture shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article X.
Trustee Entitled To Rely
SECTION 10.14. . Each Holder by accepting a Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in this Article X and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
SECTION 10.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article X or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company
SECTION 10.16. . Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions
. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Notes when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under the Original Indenture (other than obligations solely with respect to Securities other than the Notes), this Third Supplemental Indenture and the Notes and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under the Original Indenture (other than obligations solely with respect to Securities other than the Notes), this Third Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Subsidiary Guarantor and that such Subsidiary Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 10 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
SECTION 10.01.
Guaranties
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under the Original Indenture, this Third Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Original Indenture, this Third Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 10.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
     Except as expressly set forth in Section 8.01(b) of the Indenture and Sections 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Original Indenture, this Third Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
     In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI of the Indenture for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article VI of the Indenture, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 10.01.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.
. Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
SECTION 10.02.
Limitation on Liability
. This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in the Original Indenture, this Third Supplemental Indenture and in the Notes shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
SECTION 10.03.
Successors and Assigns
. Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
SECTION 10.04.
No Waiver
. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
SECTION 10.05.
Modification
. Upon (a) the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all of the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (c) the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article 10 without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At the request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
SECTION 10.06.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor
     Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by such Subsidiary
SECTION 11.01.
Agreement To Subordinate.
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 11, to the prior payment of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guaranty of Senior Indebtedness of the Company) shall rank senior to the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.
. Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property:
SECTION 11.02. Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article 11 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders may receive shares of stock and any debt Notes of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to such Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent as Subsidiary Guaranty.
. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall make its Subsidiary Guaranty or purchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any Notes or other Obligations (collectively, "pay its Subsidiary Guaranty") if either of the following (a "Payment Default") occurs: (1) any Obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid in full in cash when due; or (2) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms; unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of any Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not pay its Subsidiary Guaranty for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of (with a copy to such Subsidiary Guarantor) written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (1) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or
SECTION 11.03. Default on Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (3) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Payment Notice or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, any Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty after termination of such Payment Blockage Period. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subject to more than one Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period, except that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than holders of the Bank Indebtedness), a Representative of holders of Bank Indebtedness may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event may the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor initiating such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
. If a demand for payment is made on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 10, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or their Representatives) of such demand.
SECTION 11.04. Demand for Payment
. If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article 11 should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor and pay it over to them or their Representatives as their interests may appear.
SECTION 11.05. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
. After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. A distribution made under this Article 11 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Holders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
SECTION 11.06. Subrogation
. This Article 11 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
SECTION 11.07. Relative Rights
     (1) impair, as between a Subsidiary Guarantor and Holders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay its Subsidiary Guaranty to the extent set forth in Article 10; or
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders.
. No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Subsidiary Guaranty of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Subsidiary Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
SECTION 11.08. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
. Notwithstanding Section 11.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall continue to make payments on any Subsidiary Guaranty and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that such payments are prohibited by this Article 11. The Company, the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
SECTION 11.09. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 11 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article VII of the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 of the Indenture.
. Whenever any Person is to make a distribution or give a notice to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Person shall be entitled to make such distribution or give such notice to their Representative (if any).
SECTION 11.10. Distribution or Notice to Representative
. The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty by reason of any provision in this Article 11 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article 11 shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guaranty.
SECTION 11.11. Article 11 Not To Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right To Demand Payment
. Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (1) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 11.02 are pending, (2) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (3) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
SECTION 11.12. Trustee Entitled To Rely
Third Supplemental Indenture
 
holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 11. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 11, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 11, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Indenture shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 11.
. Each Holder by accepting a Note authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in this Article 11 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
SECTION 11.13. Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 11 or otherwise.
SECTION 11.14. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Notes, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.

Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
     The Notes are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and whole multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.

13.
Discharge and Defeasance
     Subject to certain conditions, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
14.
Amendment, Waiver
     Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture and the Notes may be amended or supplemented, and compliance with any provision of the Indenture may be waived, with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes and (ii) any default or noncompliance with any provision may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Notes. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee shall be entitled to amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, (2) comply with Article V of the Indenture, (3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, (4) add guarantees with respect to the Notes, including Subsidiary Guaranties, or to secure the Notes, or to confirm the release, termination or
 
discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any such Lien when such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the Indenture, (5) comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with qualifying, or maintaining the qualification of, the Indenture under the TIA, (6) add additional covenants or surrender rights and powers conferred on the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, (7) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to the Notes, (8) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture; provided that any such change or elimination shall become effective only where there is no outstanding Note that is adversely affected in any material respect by that change in or elimination of that provision, (9) to supplement any of the provisions of the Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture; provided, however, that any such action shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holder of any Notes in any material respect, (10) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor trustee with respect to the Notes and to add or change any of the provisions of the Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the Indenture by more than one trustee, or (11) to make any change to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision in the Prospectus Supplement in the section "Description of the Notes" that does not adversely affect the Holder of any Note.
15.
Defaults and Remedies
     Under the Indenture, Events of Default include (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal on the Notes at maturity, upon redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Notes, upon acceleration or otherwise, or failure by the Company to redeem or purchase Notes when required; (iii) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes, in certain cases subject to notice and lapse of time; (iv) certain accelerations (including failure to pay within any grace period after final maturity) of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (other than Non-Recourse Purchase Money Indebtedness) if the amount accelerated (or so unpaid) exceeds $10.0 million, provided that such acceleration is not rescinded within a period of 10 days from the occurrence of such acceleration; (v) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company and the Significant Subsidiaries; (vi) certain judgments or decrees for the payment of money in excess of $10.0 million; and (vii) certain defaults with respect to Subsidiary Guaranties. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Notes being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the Holders.
 
16.
Trustee Dealings with the Company
     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
17.
No Recourse Against Others
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.
18.
Authentication
     This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
19.

20.
CUSIP Numbers
     Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.
Secured Parties
     WHEREAS, Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (""), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (""), and certain other financial institutions, as other agents and Banks, are parties to that certain Credit Agreement (as amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the "") dated as of March 9, 2010, pursuant to which Banks have made a revolving credit loan to Borrower and Letter of Credit Issuer has agreed to issue and participate in letters of credit issued on behalf of Borrower (unless otherwise defined herein, all terms used herein with their initial letter capitalized shall have the meaning given such terms in the Credit Agreement); and
Borrower
Administrative Agent
Credit Agreement
     WHEREAS, Banks have required, as a condition to the continued extension of credit under the Credit Agreement, that Guarantor execute and deliver this Guarantee; and
     WHEREAS, Guarantor has determined that valuable benefits will be derived by it as a result of the Credit Agreement and the extension of credit made (and to be made) by Banks thereunder; and
     WHEREAS, Guarantor has further determined that the benefits accruing to it from the Credit Agreement exceed Guarantor's anticipated liability under this Guarantee.
     NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:
     1. Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the prompt, complete and full payment when due, no matter how such shall become due, of the Obligations, and further guarantees that Borrower will properly and timely perform the Obligations. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Guarantee, however, Guarantor's maximum liability under this Guarantee is limited, to the extent, if any, required so that its liability is not subject to avoidance under applicable Debtor Relief Laws (as such term is defined in hereof).
Paragraph 8
     2. If Guarantor is or becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by Borrower to any Secured Party by endorsement or otherwise than under this Guarantee, such liability shall not be in any manner impaired or affected hereby, and the rights of Secured Parties hereunder shall be
 
cumulative of any and all other rights that Secured Parties may ever have against Guarantor. The exercise by any Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other instrument, at law or in equity, shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy.
     3. In the event of default by Borrower in payment of the Obligations, or any part thereof, when such Obligations become due, either by their terms or as the result of the exercise of any power to accelerate, Guarantor shall, on demand, and without further notice of dishonor and without any notice having been given to Guarantor previous to such demand of the acceptance by Secured Parties of this Guarantee, and without any notice having been given to such Guarantor previous to such demand of the creating or incurring of such Obligations, pay the amount due thereon to Secured Parties at Administrative Agent's office as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any Secured Party, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantor, first, to institute suit or exhaust its remedies against Borrower or others liable on such Obligations, to have Borrower joined with Guarantor in any suit brought under this Guarantee or to enforce its rights against any security which shall ever have been given to secure such indebtedness; , , in the event any Secured Party elects to enforce and/or exercise any remedies it may possess with respect to any security for the Obligations prior to demanding payment from Guarantor, Guarantor shall nevertheless be obligated hereunder for any and all sums still owing to Secured Parties on the Obligations and not repaid or recovered incident to the exercise of such remedies.
provided
however
that
     4. Notice to Guarantor of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the making, renewing or assignment of the Obligations and each item thereof, are hereby expressly waived by Guarantor.
     5. Each payment on the Obligations shall be deemed to have been made by Borrower unless express written notice is given to Administrative Agent (on behalf of Secured Parties) at the time of such payment that such payment is made by Guarantor as specified in such notice.
     6. If all or any part of the Obligations at any time are secured, Guarantor agrees that Administrative Agent and/or Secured Parties may at any time and from time to time, at their discretion and with or without valuable consideration, allow substitution or withdrawal of collateral or other security and release collateral or other security or compromise or settle any amount due or owing under the Credit Agreement or amend or modify in whole or in part the Credit Agreement or any Loan Paper executed in connection with same without impairing or diminishing the obligations of Guarantor hereunder. Guarantor further agrees that if Borrower executes in favor of any Secured Party any collateral agreement, mortgage or other security instrument, the exercise by any Secured Party of any right or remedy thereby conferred on such Secured Party shall be wholly discretionary with such Secured Party, and that the exercise or failure to exercise any such right or remedy shall in no way impair or diminish the obligation of Guarantor hereunder. Guarantor further agrees that Secured Parties and Administrative Agent shall not be liable for their failure to use diligence in the collection of the Obligations or in preserving the liability of any person liable for the Obligations, and Guarantor hereby waives presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment, protest and notice thereof (including, notice of
 
acceleration), and diligence in bringing suits against any Person liable on the Obligations, or any part thereof.
     7. Guarantor agrees that Secured Parties, in their discretion, may (a) bring suit against all guarantors (including, without limitation, Guarantor hereunder) of the Obligations jointly and severally or against any one or more of them, (b) compound or settle with any one or more of such guarantors for such consideration as Secured Parties may deem proper, and (c) release one or more of such guarantors from liability hereunder in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and that no such action shall impair the rights of Secured Parties to collect the Obligations (or the unpaid balance thereof) from other such guarantors of the Obligations, or any of them, not so sued, settled with or released. Guarantor agrees, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph, and no action by Secured Parties permitted under this paragraph, shall in any way affect or impair the rights or obligations of such guarantors among themselves.
     8. Guarantor represents and warrants to each Secured Party that (a) Guarantor is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation; (b) Guarantor possesses all requisite authority and power to authorize, execute, deliver and comply with the terms of this Guarantee; (c) this Guarantee has been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by applicable Debtor Relief Laws; and (d) no approval or consent of any court or governmental entity is required for the authorization, execution, delivery or compliance with this Guarantee which has not been obtained (and copies thereof delivered to Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Parties). As used in this Guarantee, the term, "" means the Bankruptcy Code of the United States of America and all other applicable liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, suspension of payments or similar debtor relief laws from time to time in effect affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Debtor Relief Laws
     9. Guarantor covenants and agrees that until the Obligations are paid and performed in full, except as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement or unless the applicable Secured Parties give their prior written consent to any deviation therefrom in accordance with Section 14.5 of the Credit Agreement, it will (a) at all times maintain its existence and authority to transact business in any State or jurisdiction where Guarantor has assets and operations, except where the failure to maintain such existence or authority would not have a Material Adverse Effect, (b) deliver to Administrative Agent such information respecting its business affairs, assets and liabilities as any Bank may reasonably request, and (c) observe and perform all covenants applicable to Guarantor under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Papers. The failure of Guarantor to comply with the terms of this paragraph shall be an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement.
     10. This Guarantee is for the benefit of Secured Parties, their respective successors and assigns, and in the event of an assignment by Secured Parties (or their respective successors or assigns) of the Obligations, or any part thereof, the rights and benefits hereunder, to the extent applicable to the Obligations so assigned, may be transferred with such Obligations. This Guarantee is binding upon Guarantor and its successors and assigns.
 
     11. No modification, consent, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guarantee, nor consent to any departure by Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the applicable Secured Parties in accordance with Section 14.5 of the Credit Agreement, and then shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall, of itself, entitle Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No delay or omission by Secured Parties in exercising any power or right hereunder shall impair any such right or power or be construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or power hereunder. All rights and remedies of Secured Parties hereunder are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy which Secured Parties may otherwise have at law or in equity or under any other contract or document, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.
     12. No provision herein or in any promissory note, instrument or any other Loan Paper executed by Borrower or Guarantor evidencing the Obligations shall require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate. If any excess of interest in such respect is provided for herein or in any such promissory note, instrument, or any other Loan Paper, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern, and neither Borrower nor Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the extent that it is in excess of the amount permitted by law. The intention of the parties being to conform strictly to any applicable federal or state usury laws now in force, all promissory notes, instruments and other Loan Papers executed by Borrower or Guarantor evidencing the Obligations shall be held subject to reduction to the amount allowed under said usury laws as now or hereafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction.
     13. If Guarantor should breach or fail to perform any provision of this Guarantee, Guarantor agrees to pay Secured Parties all costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Secured Parties in the enforcement hereof.
     14. (a) The liability of Guarantor under this Guarantee shall in no manner be impaired, affected or released by the insolvency, bankruptcy, making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, arrangement, compensation, composition or readjustment of Borrower, or any proceedings affecting the status, existence or assets of Borrower or other similar proceedings instituted by or against Borrower and affecting the assets of Borrower.
          (b) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on any portion of the Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Obligations if said proceedings had not been commenced) shall be included in the Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantor, Administrative Agent and Secured Parties that the Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve Borrower of any portion of such Obligations. Guarantor will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or
 
similar person to pay Secured Parties or Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of Secured Parties or Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such proceeding is commenced.
          (c) In the event that all or any portion of the Obligations are paid by Borrower, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute Obligations for all purposes under this Guarantee.
     15. Guarantor understands and agrees that any amounts of Guarantor on account with any Secured Party may be offset to satisfy the obligations of Guarantor hereunder.
     16. Guarantor hereby subordinates and makes inferior any and all indebtedness now or at any time hereafter owed by Borrower to Guarantor to the Obligations evidenced by the Credit Agreement and agrees after the occurrence of a Default under the Credit Agreement, or any event which with notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a Default under the Credit Agreement, not to permit Borrower to repay, or to accept payment from Borrower of, such indebtedness or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the applicable Secured Parties in accordance with Section 14.5 of the Credit Agreement.
     17. During the period that Banks have any commitment to lend or participate in Letter of Credit Exposure under the Loan Papers, or any amount payable under any Note remains unpaid or any Letter of Credit remains outstanding, and throughout any additional preferential period subsequent thereto, Guarantor hereby waives any and all rights of subrogation to which Guarantor may otherwise be entitled against Borrower, or any other guarantor of the Obligations, as a result of any payment made by Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee.
     18. As of the date hereof, the fair saleable value of the property of Guarantor is greater than the total amount of liabilities (including contingent and unliquidated liabilities) of Guarantor, and Guarantor is able to pay all of its liabilities as such liabilities mature and Guarantor does not have unreasonably small capital within the meaning of Section 548, Title 11, United States Code, as amended. In computing the amount of contingent or liquidated liabilities, such liabilities have been computed at the amount which, in light of all the facts and circumstances existing as of the date hereof, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.
     19. If any provision of this Guarantee is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable; this Guarantee shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as a part of this Guarantee a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.
 
     20. (a) Except to the extent required for the exercise of the remedies provided in the other security instruments, Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in New York County, New York over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or any other Loan Paper, and Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such state or federal court. Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any Litigation arising out of or in connection with this Guarantee or any of the Loan Papers brought in any courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America located in New York County, New York. Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim that any Litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Guarantor hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing of copies thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to Guarantor's office at 5100 Tennyson Parkway, Suite 1200, Plano, Texas 75024. Guarantor irrevocably agrees that any legal proceeding against Secured Parties shall be brought in the district courts of the State of New York or of the United States of America located in New York County, New York. Nothing herein shall affect the right of Secured Party to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against Guarantor in any jurisdiction or to serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law. As used herein, the term "" means any proceeding, claim, lawsuit or investigation (a) conducted by or before any court or governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality of the United States or of any state, commonwealth, nation, territory, possession, county, parish, or municipality, whether now or hereafter constituted or existing, or (b) pending before any public or private arbitration board or panel.
Litigation
          (c) Nothing in this shall affect any right of any Secured Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of any Secured Party to bring any action or proceeding against Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdictions.
Paragraph 20
          (d) To the extent that Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Guarantee and the other Loan Papers.
     21. THIS GUARANTEE AND THE OTHER LOAN PAPERS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BY AND AMONG SECURED PARTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND GUARANTOR AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF SECURED PARTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND GUARANTOR. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG SECURED PARTIES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND GUARANTOR.
     22. GUARANTOR, FOR ITSELF, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN PAPERS.
 
     23. THIS GUARANTEE AND THE OTHER LOAN PAPERS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Pledgor further waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Other Liable Party or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Other Liable Party. Until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full, Pledgor shall have no right to subrogation and Pledgor waives the right to enforce any remedy which Pledgee or any Secured Party has or may hereafter have against any Other Liable Party, and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any other security whatsoever now or hereafter held by Pledgee. Pledgor authorizes Pledgee and each Secured Party, without notice or demand and without any reservation of rights against Pledgor and without affecting Pledgor's liability hereunder or on the Obligations, from time to time to (a) take or hold any other property of any type from any other Person as security for the Obligations, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any or all of such other property; (b) renew, extend for any period, accelerate, modify, compromise, settle or release any of the obligations of any Other Liable Party in respect to any or all of the Obligations or other security for the Obligations; (c) waive, enforce, modify, amend or supplement any of the provisions of any Obligation Document with any Person other than Pledgor; and (d) release or substitute any Other Liable Party.

          (iii) all dividends and interest payments which are received by Pledgor contrary to the provisions of subsection (b)(i) of this shall be received in trust for the benefit of Pledgee, shall be segregated from other funds of Pledgor, and shall be forthwith paid over to Pledgee as Pledged Equity in the exact form received, to be held by Pledgee as Collateral.

taken which would have the effect of impairing the rights of the Pledgee in respect of the Pledged Equity.

Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that Pledgee shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit Pledgor or the Subsidiaries to register such securities (with no obligation of either Pledgor or any Subsidiary to accomplish such registration) for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""). Pledgor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such securities which has been (a) publicly advertised on a basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial community of New York, New York (to the extent that such an offer may be so advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act), or (b) made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen (15) offerees shall be deemed to involve a "public disposition" for the purposes of Section 9-610 of the Code (or any successor or similar, applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act, and that Pledgee may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities.

After Pledgor receives notice that Pledgee has given any notice referred to above in this subsection, (i) all amounts and proceeds (including instruments and writings) received by Pledgor in respect of such accounts or general intangibles shall be received in trust for the benefit of Pledgee hereunder, shall be segregated from other funds of Pledgor and shall be forthwith paid over to Pledgee in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement) to be held as cash collateral and (A) released to Pledgor upon the remedy of all Defaults or Events of Default, or (B) if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, applied as specified in ; and (ii) Pledgor will not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or payment of any such account or general intangible or release wholly or partly any account debtor or obligor thereof (including Borrower) or allow any credit or discount thereon.
Collection Rights

Section 4.2
Event of Default Remedies
          (a) exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, under the other Obligation Documents or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code (whether or not the Code applies to the affected Collateral);
          (b) require Pledgor to, and Pledgor hereby agrees that it will upon request of Pledgee forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Pledgee and make it
 
available to Pledgee at a place to be designated by Pledgee which is reasonably convenient to both parties;
          (c) reduce its claim to judgment against Pledgor or foreclose or otherwise enforce, in whole or in part, the security interest created hereby by any available judicial procedure;
          (d) dispose of, at its office, on the premises of Pledgor or elsewhere, all or any part of the Collateral, as a unit or in parcels, by public or private proceedings, and by way of one or more contracts (it being agreed that the sale of any part of the Collateral shall not exhaust Pledgee's power of sale, but sales may be made from time to time, and at any time, until all of the Collateral has been sold or until the Obligations have been paid and performed in full), and at any such sale it shall not be necessary to exhibit any of the Collateral;
          (e) buy (or allow any Secured Party to buy) the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any public sale;
          (f) buy (or allow any Secured Party to buy) the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations; and
          (g) apply by appropriate judicial proceedings for appointment of a receiver for the Collateral, or any part thereof, and Pledgor hereby consents to any such appointment.
Pledgor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days' notice to Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. Pledgee shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. Pledgee may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.
     . If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Pledgee may in its discretion apply any cash held by Pledgee as Collateral, and any cash proceeds received by Pledgee in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral, in the order and manner contemplated by Section 3.2 of the Credit Agreement.
Section 4.3
Application of Proceeds
     . In addition to, and not in qualification of, any similar obligations under other Obligation Documents:
Section 4.4
Release and Expenses
          (a) Pledgor agrees to release and forever discharge Pledgee and each Secured Party from and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities growing out of or resulting from this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement). The foregoing release and discharge shall apply whether or not such claims, losses and liabilities are in any way or to any extent owed, in whole or in part, under any claim or theory of strict liability or are, to any extent caused, in whole or in part, by any negligent act or omission of any kind by Pledgee or any Secured Party.
 
          (b) Borrower or Pledgor will upon demand pay to Pledgee the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of Pledgee's counsel and of any experts and agents, which Pledgee may incur in connection with (i) the transactions which give rise to this Agreement; (ii) the preparation of this Agreement and the perfection and preservation of the security interest created under this Agreement; (iii) the administration of this Agreement; (iv) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any Collateral; (v) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Pledgee hereunder; or (vi) the failure by Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof, except expenses resulting from Pledgee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
     . In granting to Pledgee the power to enforce its rights hereunder without prior judicial process or judicial hearing, Pledgor expressly waives, renounces and knowingly relinquishes any legal right which might otherwise require Pledgee to enforce its rights by judicial process. In so providing for non-judicial remedies, Pledgor recognizes and concedes that such remedies are consistent with the usage of trade, are responsive to commercial necessity, and are the result of a bargain at arm's length. Nothing herein is intended to prevent Pledgee or Pledgor from resorting to judicial process at either party's option.
Section 4.5
Non-Judicial Remedies
     . Pledgor waives any right to require Pledgee or Secured Parties to proceed against any other Person, exhaust any Collateral or other security for the Obligations, or to have any Other Liable Party joined with Pledgor in any suit arising out of the Obligations or this Agreement, or pursue any other remedy in Pledgee's power. Pledgor further waives any and all notice of acceptance of this Agreement and of the creation, modification, rearrangement, renewal or extension for any period of any of the Obligations from time to time. Pledgor further waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Other Liable Party or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Other Liable Party. Until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full, Pledgor shall have no right to subrogation and Pledgor waives the right to enforce any remedy which Pledgee or any Secured Party has or may hereafter have against any Other Liable Party, and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any other security whatsoever now or hereafter held by Pledgee. Pledgor authorizes Pledgee and each Secured Party, without notice or demand and without any reservation of rights against Pledgor and without affecting Pledgor's liability hereunder or on the Obligations, from time to time to (a) take or hold any other property of any type from any other Person as security for the Obligations, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any or all of such other property; (b) renew, extend for any period, accelerate, modify, compromise, settle or release any of the obligations of any Other Liable Party in respect to any or all of the Obligations or other security for the Obligations; (c) waive, enforce, modify, amend or supplement any of the provisions of any Obligation Document with any Person other than Pledgor; and (d) release or substitute any Other Liable Party.

a partial or total liquidation or dissolution of any Subsidiary in accordance with Section 9.4(b) of the Credit Agreement; , that any and all

          (ii) dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any Pledged Equity in connection with a reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and
          (iii) cash paid, payable or otherwise distributed in redemption of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Equity,
shall be, and shall forthwith be delivered to Pledgee to hold as, Pledged Equity and shall, if received by Pledgor, be received in trust for the benefit of Pledgee, be segregated from the other property or funds of Pledgor, and be forthwith delivered to Pledgee in the exact form received with any necessary endorsement or appropriate stock powers duly executed in blank, to be held by Pledgee as Collateral.
          (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default:
          (i) all rights of Pledgor to receive and retain the dividends, distributions and interest payments which Pledgor would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to subsection (a) of this shall automatically cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in Pledgee which shall thereupon have the right to receive and hold as Pledged Equity such dividends, distributions and interest payments;
Section 4.7
          (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pledgee may at its option exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to any of the Pledged Equity as if it were the absolute owner thereof, including the right to exchange, in its discretion, any and all of the Pledged Equity upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other adjustment of Pledgor or any Subsidiary, or upon the exercise by Pledgor or any Subsidiary of any right, privilege or option pertaining to any Pledged Equity, and, in connection therewith, to deposit and deliver any and all of the Pledged Equity with any committee, depository, transfer, agent, registrar or other designated agent upon such terms and conditions as it may determine; and
          (iii) all dividends and interest payments which are received by Pledgor contrary to the provisions of subsection (b)(i) of this shall be received in trust for the benefit of Pledgee, shall be segregated from other funds of Pledgor, and shall be forthwith paid over to Pledgee as Pledged Equity in the exact form received, to be held by Pledgee as Collateral.
Section 4.7
 
          (c) So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Pledgor may exercise any and all voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Equity or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or any other Obligation Document; , that no vote or other right shall be exercised or action taken which would have the effect of impairing the rights of the Pledgee in respect of the Pledged Equity. At any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Pledgor will permit Pledgee or its nominee, without notice, to exercise all voting rights or other rights relating to the Pledged Equity, including, without limitation, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges, or options pertaining to the Pledged Equity as if it were the absolute owner thereof.
provided,
however
     . Pledgor recognizes that Pledgee may deem it impracticable to effect a public sale of all or any part of the Pledged Equity and that Pledgee may, therefore, determine to make one or more private sales of any such securities to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sales shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that Pledgee shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit Pledgor or any Subsidiary to register such securities (with no obligation of either Pledgor or any Subsidiary to accomplish such registration) for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""). Pledgor further acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such securities which has been (a) publicly advertised on a basis in a newspaper or other publication of general circulation in the financial community of New York, New York (to the extent that such an offer may be so advertised without prior registration under the Securities Act), or (b) made privately in the manner described above to not less than fifteen (15) offerees shall be deemed to involve a "public disposition" for the purposes of Section 9-610 of the Code (or any successor or similar, applicable statutory provision) as then in effect in the State of New York, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act, and that Pledgee may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities.

     DALLAS  March 9, 2010  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury") announced today that it has closed its acquisition of Encore Acquisition Company ("Encore"), entered into a new $1.6 billion 24-bank credit facility, and briefly extended its tender offers for Encore senior subordinated notes. With the merger, Denbury becomes one of the largest oil-focused independent oil and natural gas companies in the United States. The combined company will continue to be known as Denbury Resources Inc. (the "Company") and will be headquartered in Plano, Texas.
Merger
     The merger closed this evening following approval by the stockholders of both Denbury and Encore at meetings held this morning, and subsequent completion of closing documentation. In the merger, Denbury issued approximately 134.4 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $829.4 million in cash to Encore stockholders. The number of Denbury shares issued to Encore public holders represents an exchange ratio of 2.4048 Denbury shares and $15.00 in cash for each previously outstanding share of Encore common stock, based on an overall 30% cash and 70% stock pro ration of the overall consideration, subject to different ratios for all-cash and all-stock elections made by Encore stockholders. The Denbury shares issued to Encore stockholders will represent approximately 33.9% of Denbury's issued and outstanding common stock after the merger, based upon Denbury shares outstanding at January 31, 2010.
     Trading in Encore's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: EAC) terminated after market close today, March 9.
th
New Credit Facility
     Denbury today entered into a new Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and 23 other lenders that are parties thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for an initial borrowing base and aggregate lenders' commitment of $1.6 billion. Denbury anticipates that after draws under the facility to fund the Encore merger, approximately $600 million to $700 million will remain available under the credit facility. Denbury's new bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of its producing oil and natural gas properties.
 
Tender Offers
     Denbury announced its intention to accept for purchase all of Encore's senior subordinated notes tendered by holders pursuant to cash tender offers and related consent solicitations commenced on February 8, 2010 for $600 million aggregate principal amount of three series of outstanding Encore senior subordinated notes. As of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 9, 2010, tenders and consents had been received with respect to (i) $108,216,000 aggregate principal amount, or 72%, of Encore's outstanding 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, (ii) $268,801,000 aggregate principal amount, or 90%, of Encore's outstanding 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015, and (iii) $123,515,000 aggregate principal amount, or 82%, of Encore's outstanding 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017.

The purchase of tendered notes will be financed with a portion of the net proceeds from Denbury's $1.0 billion of 8/% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2020 sold early last month. Denbury will assume Encore's position as obligor on the remainder of all Encore senior subordinated notes which remain outstanding, and, in accordance with the applicable indentures, will, within 30 days after consummation of the merger, notify the holders thereof of their right to resell those notes to Denbury at 101% of the face amount thereof.
