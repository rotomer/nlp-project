Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
This Form 8-K describes certain performance based long-term incentive awards earned by executive officers of Denbury Resources Inc. (the "Company") based upon Company performance under two different sets of long-term incentive grants, one of which measured Company performance during the three year period ended December 31, 2009, and the other for Company performance solely during 2009. On March 23, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") certified that certain levels of performance had been met under these awards, resulting in the vesting of the number of shares of common stock specified below. These awards were granted to our executive officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and our next three most highly compensated executive officers, among others, during January 2007 and January 2009, respectively.
This Form 8-K also describes modifications to the long-term performance-based incentive awards granted in January 2010 to the executive officers of the Company. Otherwise the compensation arrangements and plans described in previous filings remain in place.

Long-term Incentive Grants to Executive Officers
Two different sets of performance-based long-term incentive grants are addressed in this Form 8-Kthose granted in 2007 and those granted in 2009.
The 2007 long-term incentive grants were awarded on January 2, 2007, and the number of performance-based shares of common stock earned by the executive officers was based upon Company performance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2009. The 2009 long-term incentive grants were awarded on January 2, 2009, and the number of performance-based shares of common stock earned was based upon Company performance solely for calendar 2009. Both sets of shares earned under these awards vest on March 31, 2010. All other performance metrics upon which the performance-based long-term incentive grants were determined are the same.
The number of performance-based shares earned during the performance period depended on the Company's level of success in achieving four specifically-identified performance targets. Generally, one-half of the shares earnable under the performance-based shares could be earned for performance at the designated target levels (100% target vesting levels), and twice that number of shares could be earned if the higher maximum target levels were met. The targets chosen by the Compensation Committee were generally intended to be based upon controllable Company performance factors, which for the most part would exclude the effect of changes in commodity prices. The four specifically-identified performance targets upon which the level of earning of performance-based shares was based are shown below at the maximum award levels, along with the weighting assigned to each target:
On March 23, 2010 the Committee certified the performance results for the periods covered by both sets of awards. The 2007 awards will vest on March 31, 2010 at the 110% level for those officers listed below who received 2007 awards, and the 2009 awards will vest on the same date at the 120% level for those officers listed below who received 2009 awards. The number of shares earned under each set of awards are listed below:
 
 
Modifications of 2008 and 2010 Long-term Incentive Grants to Executive Officers
The long-term incentive grants awarded to officers in January 2008 and in January 2010 will vest on March 31, 2011, based on the degree to which specifically-identified performance targets are met for the three-year period and one-year period, respectively, ending December 31, 2010. Given the Company's acquisition of Encore Acquisition Company ("Encore") on March 9, 2010, at their March 23, 2010 meeting, the Committee adjusted two of the performance measures which apply to the measurement of 2010 Company performance to accommodate the Encore acquisition.
For 2010 performance, the performance target based upon "actual total corporate production versus forecasted production" was modified so that forecasted production for 2010 would include production forecasts that include production from properties acquired as part of the Encore acquisition.
For the awards granted in January 2010, for 2010 performance, the portion of the performance target "finding cost plus operating expenses plus G&A expense per BOE versus peer group" has been replaced by a target which compares total Company lease operation costs (excluding the cost of CO) to budgeted lease operating costs for those operations for that period.
