Note 1. Basis of Presentation
Encore Merger
     On March 9, 2010, Denbury acquired Encore pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") entered into with Encore on October 31, 2009. The Merger Agreement provided for a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion at that time, including the assumption of debt and the value of the noncontrolling interest in Encore Energy Partners LP ("ENP"). Under the Merger Agreement, Encore was merged with and into Denbury (the "Merger"), with Denbury surviving the Merger. The Merger was consummated on March 9, 2010, following approval by the stockholders of both Denbury and Encore, closing of a new revolving credit facility as part of the financing for the Merger, and satisfaction of conditions precedent. The combined company continues to be known as Denbury Resources Inc. and is headquartered in Plano, Texas.
     In the Merger, Denbury issued approximately 135.2 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $833.9 million in cash to Encore stockholders. The Denbury shares issued to Encore stockholders represented approximately 34 percent of Denbury's common stock issued and outstanding immediately after the Merger. The total fair value of the Denbury common stock issued to Encore stockholders pursuant to the Merger was approximately $2.1 billion based upon Denbury's closing price of $15.43 per share on March 9, 2010. Consideration transferred and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest of ENP were allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed of both Encore and ENP based upon their estimated fair values. The preliminary purchase price allocation is reflected in Denbury's historical balance sheet as of March 31, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the period of January 1, 2010 through March 9, 2010, includes adjustments to conform Encore's accounting for oil and natural gas properties to the full cost method. Denbury follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties while Encore followed the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Certain costs that are capitalized under the full cost method are expensed under the successful efforts method. These costs consist primarily of unsuccessful exploration drilling costs, geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, abandonment costs, and general and administrative expenses directly related to exploration and development activities. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, proved property acquisition costs are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over total proved reserves and costs of wells, including related equipment and facilities, are depreciated over the life of the proved developed reserves that will utilize those capitalized assets on a field-by-field basis. Under the full cost method of accounting, property acquisition costs, costs of wells, including related equipment and facilities, and future development costs are included in a single full cost pool, which is amortized on a unit-of-production basis over total proved reserves.
Issuance of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020
     On February 10, 2010, Denbury issued $1.0 billion of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions of $980 million. The 2020 Notes were sold at par. Upon the closing of the Merger, $400 million of the net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Merger consideration and as of March 31, 2010, Denbury had redeemed $500.5 million principal amount of Encore's outstanding senior subordinated notes in a tender offer. Under the indenture governing the 2020 Notes, to the extent that fewer than $600 million principal amount of Encore's outstanding senior subordinated notes were repurchased in tender offers or change of control repurchases under the Encore indentures, Denbury is required to redeem an equal amount of the 2020 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Denbury reclassified $99.5 million of the 2020 Notes as a current liability at March 31, 2010, as it had only redeemed $500.5 million principal amount of Encore's outstanding senior subordinated notes at that date. In April 2010, Denbury repurchased an additional $95.7 million principal amount of Encore's outstanding senior subordinated notes under change of control provisions of Encore's senior subordinated notes, and redeemed $3.7 million principal amount of the 2020 Notes under the terms thereof.
     The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Operations reflect the issuance of the 2020 Notes and March 2010 repurchases of Encore's senior subordinated notes discussed above as if each had occurred January 1, 2009. The issuance of the 2020 Notes and March 2010 repurchases of Encore's senior subordinated notes were completed prior to March 31, 2010 and accordingly, are reflected in Denbury's historical balance sheet at March 31, 2010. The April 2010 repurchases of $95.7 million of Encore's senior subordinated notes and the $3.7 million principal amount redeemed on the 2020 Notes are not reflected in the accompanying pro forma financial information.
New $1.6 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement
     On March 9, 2010, Denbury entered into a new $1.6 billion revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and 23 other lenders as party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement,
 
coupled with the funds from Denbury's issuance of the 2020 Notes, were used to:
     Both Denbury's and Encore's then existing revolving credit agreements were repaid on March 9, 2010. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet at March 31, 2010 assumes the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement of $800 million at March 31, 2010 were repaid with proceeds from the sale of the Southern Assets.
Sale of the 60% Barnett Assets
Sale of the 40% Barnett Assets
     In December 2009, Denbury closed the sale of the remaining 40 percent of its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon for $210 million (before closing adjustments). Net proceeds were approximately $209.9 million (after closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was December 1, 2009, and consequently operating net revenues after December 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. Denbury used the net proceeds from the sale to repay bank debt. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 assumes the sale closed on January 1, 2009.
Sale of the Southern Assets
     On March 31, 2010, Denbury entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Southern Assets to Quantum Resources Management, LLC, for a sales price of $900 million (before closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was May 1, 2010, and consequently operating net revenues after May 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. On May 14, 2010, Denbury completed the sale and received net proceeds of approximately $888.8 million, $830 million of which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting.
     The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet at March 31, 2010 reflects the elimination of approximately $101.4 million of goodwill attributable to the sale of the Southern Assets based on the relative fair values of the assets sold to the estimated total fair value of Denbury's net assets retained. The calculation of goodwill attributable to the Southern Assets is preliminary and will be refined as Denbury completes its fair value analysis.

     The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2010 gives effect to the disposition of the Southern Assets and the use of proceeds as if each had occurred on March 31, 2010.
