The "" are those proved undeveloped reserves expressed in BOEs which were included in the Initial Reserves, but are not considered proved undeveloped reserves on the last day of the Performance Period solely because the price deck used to price oil and natural gas products and/or the prices used to estimate the capital costs required to develop the proved undeveloped reserves as of the last day of the Performance Period have changed from those used in the Initial Reserve report such that the extraction of such otherwise proved reserves is uneconomic (i.e. Uneconomic Reserves cannot be reserves excluded from the Final Reserves because drilling activity during the period changed the status or evaluation of the undeveloped reserves, or because the Company no longer holds the acreage or interest, or because factors other than commodity prices or changes in the estimated capital costs have made the project uneconomic). The "" are those proved reserves quantities expressed in BOEs which were sold during the Performance Period as reported as such in the Company's Form 10-K SFAS 69 disclosures.
