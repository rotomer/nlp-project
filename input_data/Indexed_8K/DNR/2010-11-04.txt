Exhibit 99.1
News Release Released at 7:30 AM CDT
     DALLAS  November 4, 2010  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced its third quarter 2010 financial and operating results.
     Third quarter 2010 net income was $29.1 million, or $0.07 per basic common share, as compared to net income of $26.9 million, or $0.11 per basic common share in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 results included the following unusual or non-cash items:
     Net income adjusted to exclude these three items would have been approximately $52.7 million, or $0.13 per basic common share in the third quarter of 2010, as compared to adjusted net income of $40.7 million, or $0.16 per basic common share in the prior year third quarter, after adjustments in the 2009 period for non-cash fair value commodity derivative losses (see the accompanying schedules for a reconciliation of "net income" as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to the non-GAAP measure "adjusted net income").
     Adjusted cash flow (cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities, a non-GAAP measure) for the third quarter of 2010 was $219.9 million, as compared to adjusted cash flow of $137.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, with the increase due primarily to higher oil and natural gas production and higher oil and natural gas commodity prices during the third quarter of 2010. Cash flow provided by operations, the GAAP measure, totaled $196.1 million during the third quarter of 2010, as compared to $145.6 million during the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted cash flow and cash flow from operations differ in that the latter measure includes the changes in receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the quarter (see the accompanying schedules for a reconciliation of the GAAP measure "net cash flow provided by operations," to "adjusted cash flow from operations," which is the non-GAAP measure discussed above).
 
Production
     During the third quarter of 2010, the Company's oil and natural gas production averaged 77,730 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("BOE/d") compared to 42,659 BOE/d during the third quarter of 2009. This 35,071 BOE/d of additional production is attributable to (1) properties acquired in the Encore Merger, which contributed average production of 33,605 BOE/d during the quarter, (2) tertiary production increasing 5,184 barrels per day ("Bbls/d") between the two quarters, and (3) the December 2009 acquisition of Conroe Field which contributed average production of 2,745 BOE/d. Offsetting these production increases was a decrease of 4,948 BOE/d due to the December 2009 sale of the Company's remaining Barnett Shale properties. Excluding the production attributable to the Haynesville and East Texas assets which are scheduled to be sold in the fourth quarter 2010, the Company's adjusted third quarter 2010 production would have been 72,013 BOE/d, an increase of 91% over adjusted third quarter 2009 production (adjusted to exclude the Barnett Shale properties). The Company's Bakken production for the third quarter of 2010 averaged 4,671 BOE/d, a 3% increase over second quarter of 2010 Bakken production levels.
     Production from the Company's tertiary operations averaged 29,531 Bbls/d in the third quarter of 2010, a 21% increase over the 24,347 Bbls/d average in the third quarter of 2009 and a 4% sequential increase over average tertiary production in the second quarter of 2010. During the quarter, the Company had strong production increases compared to the prior quarter at both Heidelberg (averaging 2,806 Bbls/d, a 51% increase) and at Tinsley (averaging 6,024 Bbls/d, a 15% increase). Tinsley is the Company's top producing tertiary field. As a result of continued positive production results, the Company is increasing the guidance for its anticipated average tertiary oil production for 2010 from 28,000 Bbls/d to 28,750 Bbls/d, a revised projected annual growth rate of 18% from 2009 levels. The Company will present its 2011 production guidance at its forthcoming mid-November analyst meeting (see below).
Review of Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results
     The Company's third quarter oil and natural gas revenues, excluding any impact of derivative contracts, increased 108% as compared to revenues in the prior year quarter, as the higher production levels discussed above increased revenues by 82%, while higher commodity prices increased revenues by 26%. Oil and natural gas revenues per barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE") excluding the impact of any derivative contracts, was 14% higher in the third quarter of 2010 than in the third quarter of 2009 ($64.44 per BOE as compared to $56.39 per BOE) and was 8% higher when including derivative settlements in the comparative third quarters ($65.84 per BOE as compared to $61.11 per BOE).
     The Company received $10.0 million on its derivative contract settlements in the third quarter of 2010, as compared to cash receipts of $18.5 million during the third quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company paid $59.8 million in derivative settlements, and during the second quarter of 2010 had cash receipts of $2.8 million on its settled derivative contracts.
     The Company recorded a $41.9 million non-cash fair value charge to earnings in the third quarter of 2010 on its commodity and interest rate swap derivative contracts as compared to a $22.3 million charge in the third quarter of 2009.
     Company-wide oil price differentials (Denbury's net oil price received as compared to NYMEX prices) in the third quarter of 2010 were $3.86 per barrel of oil below NYMEX, a slightly greater differential than in the third quarter of 2009 due primarily to the addition of the Encore acquired properties which typically have a higher oil price differential than Denbury's legacy properties. The Company's oil price differential in the third quarter of 2009 was $3.47 per Bbl below NYMEX, which included a significant amount of Barnett Shale natural gas liquids production that received prices significantly below NYMEX oil prices.
 
     Lease operating expenses increased 58% on an absolute basis between the two third quarters, but decreased 13% on a per BOE basis. The increase on an absolute basis is primarily due to the March 2010 Encore acquisition and further expansion of the Company's tertiary operations, partially offset by the December 2009 sale of the remaining Barnett Shale properties. When comparing the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, the Company's largest increases in lease operating expenses (excluding the increases associated with the Encore acquisition) were related to CO expense and power and utilities as a result of the expansion of tertiary operations. The overall decrease on a per BOE basis was primarily due to those properties which were part of the Encore acquisition generally having a lower operating cost per BOE than Denbury's legacy properties. Denbury's tertiary operating expense averaged $22.54 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2010, as compared to $23.14 per Bbl in the prior year third quarter, and as compared to $21.37 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2010. Production taxes and marketing expenses increased during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to third quarter of 2009 levels, primarily as a result of higher oil prices and production and the Encore properties which generally have higher production taxes.

     Beginning this quarter, the Company expensed costs associated with the discovery of CO. These costs primarily consist of geological and geophysical expenditures in areas where the Company has not identified proved or probable CO reserves. This expense was $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2010 and is recorded in "CO discovery and operating expenses" in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to this quarter the Company capitalized such costs. The effect of these costs has been immaterial to the Company's prior financial statements and is expected to remain so (see further discussion below regarding the impact of the Company's accounting revision for its COproperties in the discussion of depletion, depreciation, and amortization).

     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses totaled $37.1 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $24.0 million in the prior year quarter. On a BOE basis, G&A expense was $5.19 per BOE in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $6.12 in the prior year quarter. During the quarter the Company incurred $11.5 million of transaction and other expenses associated with the Encore acquisition, primarily associated with employee severance. These merger-related fees are included in the Company's income statement under the caption "Transaction and other costs related to the Encore merger."
     During the third quarter of 2010, the Company capitalized approximately $10.9 million of interest expense as compared to $20.9 million capitalized during the third quarter of 2009. The decrease between the two quarters is associated with the first phase of the Green Pipeline project which was placed into service at the end of the second quarter of 2010, at which time interest capitalization on that portion of this capital project ceased. Interest expense, net of the amount capitalized, increased significantly between the respective third quarters, due to the higher debt levels in the current year quarter as a result of the Encore merger.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense for the third quarter of 2010 was $15.61 per BOE as compared to $13.64 per BOE in the prior year quarter. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company revised its method of accounting for costs associated with the discovery of COand recorded a non-cash reduction of $9.6 million to DD&A ($1.34 per BOE for the third quarter or $0.49 per BOE for the nine month 2010 period), which reflects the cumulative impact of the revised accounting policy on our historical financial statements. Excluding this adjustment, our DD&A rate for the third quarter of 2010 would have been $16.95 per BOE, with the incremental DD&A per BOE due primarily to the sale of Barnett Shale properties in 2009, the acquisition of Conroe Field in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the merger with Encore in March 2010.

Completion of Riley Ridge Acquisition
     In mid-October the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of a 42.5% working interest in the 9,700 plus acre Riley Ridge Federal unit and additional rights to CO under an additional 28,000 acres adjoining the Riley Ridge Unit. The Company estimates that the Riley Ridge Federal Unit contains proved reserves of 185 Bcf of natural gas, 6.6 Bcf of helium and approximately one Tcf of CO The acquisition price of $115 million, before purchase price adjustments, was funded with the Company's bank credit facility. First production of natural gas and helium from Riley Ridge is not expected to occur until late 2011. The full well stream is expected to consist of 65% CO, 19% natural gas, 10% HS and 0.6% helium and other gases. The Company continues to evaluate potential sources of COin the Rocky Mountain Region and therefore no determination has been made as to when facilities might be constructed to separate the COfrom the gas stream.

Outlook
     Phil Rykhoek, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our tertiary production continues to perform above our expectations as evidenced by the increase in our tertiary production guidance for a third time this year, increasing to a revised 2010 average of 28,750 Bbls/d, which is a projected 18% growth rate over 2009 average tertiary production levels. The completion of our Green Pipeline to Hasting Field remains on track for completion late this year and our production of CO at Jackson Dome recently exceeded 1 Bcf/d. We have added one Tcf of additional proved CO reserves this year at Jackson Dome, providing us with almost all the proved CO reserves we need for our existing Gulf Coast program. We also recently closed on our Riley Ridge acquisition in Wyoming, giving us a low-cost option on significant potential CO resources for our tertiary program in the Rockies. Construction of our first CO pipeline in that area is still scheduled to start next August, with plans to initiate CO flooding at Bell Creek in late 2012. We have nearly completed all of our planned asset sales following the Encore acquisition, with our most recent sale, of the Haynesville and East Texas assets, scheduled to close in early December. We are continuing to market our interest in ENP and are still hopeful that we will be able to sell that interest prior to year-end. Although we experienced some delays in well completions on several wells in the Bakken this quarter, we remain very enthusiastic about this great asset and look for several new wells to come on line in the fourth quarter."

Non-GAAP Measures
     Adjusted net income excluding certain items is a non-GAAP measure. This measure reflects net income without regard to the fair value adjustments on the Company's derivative contracts or other certain items. The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately as it is a better reflection of the ongoing comparable results of the Company, without regard to changes in the market value of the Company's derivative contracts during the period or other certain items.
     Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as summarized from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Adjusted cash flow from operations measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables. The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately, as it believes it can often be an important way to discuss changes in operating trends in its business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs and so forth, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that period.
     Denbury Resources Inc. (www.denbury.com) is a growing independent oil and natural gas company. The Company is the largest oil and natural gas operator in both Mississippi and Montana, owns the largest reserves of COused for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and holds significant operating acreage in the Rockies and Gulf Coast regions. The Company's goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with its most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations.
