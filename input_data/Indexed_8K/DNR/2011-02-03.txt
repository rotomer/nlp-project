     The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 gives effect to Denbury's acquisition of Encore, the disposition of the Southern Assets, and the related financing transactions and use of proceeds as if each had occurred on January 1, 2009.

     The unaudited pro forma statements of operations exclude the impact of nonrecurring expenses Denbury and Encore incurred as a result of the acquisition and related financings, primarily non-capitalizable banking, legal, accounting, advisory, due diligence, and integration fees.
     The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with Denbury's 2009 Form 10-K, Denbury's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and certain sections of Encore's 2009 Form 10-K included in Denbury's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2010.

The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma financial information and actual results.
 
 
 
 
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
Encore Merger
     On March 9, 2010, Denbury acquired Encore pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") entered into with Encore on October 31, 2009. The Merger Agreement provided for a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion at that time, including the assumption of debt and the value of the noncontrolling interest in Encore Energy Partners LP ("ENP"). Under the Merger Agreement, Encore was merged with and into Denbury (the "Merger"), with Denbury surviving the Merger. The Merger was consummated on March 9, 2010, following approval by the stockholders of both Denbury and Encore, closing of a new revolving credit facility as part of the financing for the Merger, and satisfaction of conditions precedent. The combined company continues to be known as Denbury Resources Inc. and is headquartered in Plano, Texas.
     In the Merger, Denbury issued approximately 135.2 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $833.9 million in cash to Encore stockholders. The Denbury shares issued to Encore stockholders represented approximately 34 percent of Denbury's common stock issued and outstanding immediately after the Merger. The total fair value of the Denbury common stock issued to Encore stockholders pursuant to the Merger was approximately $2.1 billion based upon Denbury's closing price of $15.43 per share on March 9, 2010. Consideration transferred and the fair value of the noncontrolling interest of ENP was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed of both Encore and ENP based upon their estimated fair values. The preliminary purchase price allocation is reflected in Denbury's historical balance sheet as of September 30, 2010, contained in Denbury's Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2010.
     The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and the period of January 1, 2010 through March 9, 2010, includes adjustments to conform Encore's accounting for oil and natural gas properties to the full cost method. Denbury follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties while Encore followed the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Certain costs that are capitalized under the full cost method are expensed under the successful efforts method. These costs consist primarily of unsuccessful exploration drilling costs, geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, abandonment costs, and general and administrative expenses directly related to exploration and development activities. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, proved property acquisition costs are amortized on a unit-of-production basis over total proved reserves and costs of wells, including related equipment and facilities, are depreciated over the life of the proved developed reserves that will utilize those capitalized assets on a field-by-field basis. Under the full cost method of accounting, property acquisition costs, costs of wells, including related equipment and facilities, and future development costs are included in a single full cost pool, which is amortized on a unit-of-production basis over total proved reserves.
     The Company has not presented a pro forma September 30, 2010 balance sheet as all of the above transactions are reflected in Denbury's historical consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2010 as contained in Denbury's Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2010.
Issuance of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020
     Denbury issued $996.3 million, of 8.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), net of $3.7 million in redemptions, for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions of $976.3 million. The 2020 Notes were sold at par. From the proceeds of the 2020 Notes, $400 million of the net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Merger consideration and $596.2 million were used to redeem a portion of Encore's outstanding senior subordinated notes through a series of tender offers discussed below.
     The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Operations reflect the issuance of the 2020 Notes as if it had occurred January 1, 2009.
Tender Offers for Encore's Senior Subordinated Notes
     Between February and April 2010, Denbury repurchased $596.2 million of Encore's senior subordinated notes. $500.5 million of the senior subordinated notes were purchased on March 10, 2010 and $95.7 million of the senior subordinated notes were purchased in April 2010, leaving $228.7 million of former Encore notes outstanding.
     The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Operations reflect Denbury's purchase of Encore's Senior Subordinated Notes in March and April 2010 as if each had occurred January 1, 2009.
 
New $1.6 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement
     On March 9, 2010, Denbury entered into a new $1.6 billion revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and 23 other lenders as party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, coupled with the funds from Denbury's issuance of the 2020 Notes, were used to:
     Denbury's and Encore's then existing revolving credit agreements were repaid on March 9, 2010.
Sale of the 60% Barnett Assets
     In May 2009, Denbury entered into an agreement to sell 60 percent of its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon Oil and Gas LLC ("Talon"), a privately held company, for $270 million (before closing adjustments). Denbury closed on approximately three-quarters of the sale in June 2009 and closed on the remainder of the sale in July 2009. Net proceeds were approximately $259.8 million (after closing adjustments, and net of $8.1 million for natural gas swaps transferred in the sale). The agreement was effective June 1, 2009, and consequently operating net revenues after June 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. Denbury used the net proceeds from the sale to repay bank debt. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 assumes the sale closed on January 1, 2009.
Sale of the 40% Barnett Assets
     In December 2009, Denbury closed the sale of the remaining 40 percent of its Barnett Shale natural gas assets to Talon for $210 million (before closing adjustments). Net proceeds were approximately $209.9 million (after closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was December 1, 2009, and consequently operating net revenues after December 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. Denbury used the net proceeds from the sale to repay bank debt. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 assumes the sale closed on January 1, 2009.
Sale of the Southern Assets
     On March 31, 2010, Denbury entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Southern Assets to Quantum Resources Management, LLC, for a sales price of $900 million (before closing adjustments). The effective date under the agreement was May 1, 2010, and consequently operating net revenues after May 1, net of capital expenditures, along with any other purchase price adjustments, were adjustments to the selling price. On May 14, 2010, Denbury completed the sale and received net proceeds of approximately $888.8 million, $830 million of which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. Denbury did not record a gain or loss on the sale in accordance with the full cost method of accounting. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 assumes the sale closed on January 1, 2009.
