Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
On February 3, 2011, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as representative for the several underwriters (the "Underwriters"), in connection with the offer and sale of an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of 6 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the "Notes"). The Notes were sold to the public at 100% of par, and will accrue interest from February 17, 2011. The Underwriters purchased the Notes for 98.75% of the principal amount thereof. Closing is expected to occur on February 17, 2011.
The Company will pay interest on the Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning August 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2021. The Company may redeem the Notes on or after August 15, 2016 at the redemption prices described in the prospectus.
The Notes were offered and sold under a prospectus that was part of the Company's registration statements on Forms S-3ASR and S-3MEF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Registration Nos. 333-172036 and 333-172043), both of which were automatically effective on February 3, 2011 (collectively, the "Registration Statement"). In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K and is to be incorporated by reference in its entirety into the Registration Statement.
Simultaneously with the Notes offering, the Company is making tender offers for $225 million aggregate principal amount of its 7/% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") and $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 7/% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes"). The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to repurchase all of the notes tendered in the tender offers. As a result, the underwriters or their affiliates that hold the 2013 Notes or 2015 Notes will receive their pro rata share of the net proceeds from the Notes offering that the Company uses to repurchase or redeem such notes. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, an underwriter in the offering, or its affiliates will receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering in connection with the tender offers. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated served as qualified independent underwriter with respect to the offering and sale of the Notes.

     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of the Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the fourth and sixth paragraphs under the table of Underwriters in the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Prospectus and the following information in the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus dated February 3, 2011: the final sentence of the first paragraph of the legend in the final pricing term sheet for the Securities.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to

actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and any such separate firm for the Company, each of the Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company and the Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand

and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e), in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to paragraph (d) above are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

     (g) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against the QIU in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraph (f) above, the QIU shall promptly notify the Company in writing; that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (f) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Company shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the QIU otherwise than under paragraph (f) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against the QIU and it shall have notified the Company thereof, the Company shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the QIU (who shall not, without the consent of the QIU, be counsel to the Company) to represent the QIU and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, the QIU shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the QIU unless (i) the Company and the QIU shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Company has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the QIU; (iii) the QIU shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the QIU and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Company agrees to indemnify the QIU from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time the QIU shall have requested that the Company reimburse the QIU for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Company shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Company of such request and (ii) the Company shall not have reimbursed the QIU in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. The Company shall not, without the written consent of the QIU, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the QIU is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by the

     (h) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (f) above is unavailable to the QIU or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then the Company under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying the QIU thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the QIU as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the QIU on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the QIU on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the QIU on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities, as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the QIU.

Contribution With Respect to Indemnification of the QIU.
     (i) The Company, the Guarantors and the QIU agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (h) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (h) above. The amount paid or payable by the QIU as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by QIU in connection with any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

rata
 
on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
