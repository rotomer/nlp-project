As of the Consent Payment Deadline, (i) $169,482,000 principal amount of the 2013 Notes, or 75.3% of the outstanding 2013 Notes, and (ii) $220,882,000 principal amount of the 2015 Notes, or 73.6% of the outstanding 2015 Notes, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.

however
 
continuance of any default (other than a default described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company may not pay the Securities for a period (a "") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of written notice (a "") of such default from the Representative of the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter (or earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice, (ii) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is no longer continuing or (iii) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been repaid in full).

Subrogation
          Section 10.07. . This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall:

Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
          Section 10.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

Guaranteed Obligations
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (f) except as provided in Section 11.06, any change in the ownership of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee herein constitutes a Guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a Guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantee is, to the extent and manner set forth in Article 12, subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor giving such Subsidiary Guarantee and each Subsidiary Guarantee is hereby made subject to such provisions of this Indenture.
          Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 11.02 and 11.06, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim,
 
recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Subsidiary Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
          In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Subsidiary Guarantor shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid principal amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (iii) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations and all obligations to which the Guaranteed Obligations are subordinated as provided in Article 12. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations Guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations Guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Subsidiary Guarantor for the purposes of this Section.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section.
          Section 11.02. . Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum, aggregate amount of the obligations guaranteed
Limitation on Liability
 
hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
          Section 11.03. . This Article 11 shall be binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall ensure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns
          Section 11.04. . Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 11 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 11 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver
          Section 11.05. . No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 11, nor the consent to any departure by any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Subsidiary Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Subsidiary Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification
          Section 11.06. . This Subsidiary Guarantee as to any Subsidiary Guarantor shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) upon the sale (including any sale pursuant to any exercise of remedies by a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (ii) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company; , , that such sale or transfer shall be deemed to constitute an Asset Disposition and the Company shall comply with all applicable provisions of Section 4.06 with respect to such Asset Disposition.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor
provided
however
          Section 12.01. . Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees, and each Securityholder by accepting a Security agrees, that the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 12, to the prior payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and that the subordination is for the
Agreement To Subordinate
 
benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall in all respects rank with all other Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and only Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor's Guarantees of Senior Indebtedness of the Company) shall rank senior to the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.
pari
passu
          Section 12.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor or its property:
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (1) holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full of such Senior Indebtedness in cash or cash equivalents before Securityholders shall be entitled to receive any payment pursuant to the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and
     (2) until the Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any distribution to which Securityholders would be entitled but for this Article 12 shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Securityholders may receive shares of stock and any debt securities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness, and to any debt securities received by holders of Senior Indebtedness, of such Subsidiary Guarantor to at least the same extent as the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor.
          Section 12.03. . No Subsidiary Guarantor may make any payment pursuant to its Subsidiary Guarantee or repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire or defease any Securities or other Obligations (collectively, "") if (i) any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor is not paid when due or (ii) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms unless, in either case, (x) the default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or (y) such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full; , , that such Subsidiary Guarantor may pay its Subsidiary Guarantee without regard to the foregoing if such Subsidiary Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representative of the Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which either of the events set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence has occurred and is continuing. During the continuance of any default (other than a default described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence) with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated immediately without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, such Subsidiary Guarantor may not pay its Guarantee for a period (a "") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to such Subsidiary Guarantor) of written notice (a "

provided
however
Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period

") of such default from the Representative of the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter (or earlier if such Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Trustee and such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Person or Persons who gave such Subsidiary Guarantor Blockage Notice, (ii) because the default giving rise to such Subsidiary Guarantor Blockage Notice is no longer continuing or (iii) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been repaid in full). Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding sentence (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section), unless the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness giving such Subsidiary Guarantor Blockage Notice or the Representative of such holders shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall resume payments pursuant to its Subsidiary Guarantee after the end of such Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period. A Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be subject to more than one Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period in any period of 360 consecutive days, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor during such period. For purposes of this Section, no default or event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness initiating such Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis of the commencement of a subsequent Subsidiary Guarantor Payment Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such default or event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.
Notice
          Section 12.04. . If a demand for payment is made on a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to Article 11, the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness (or their Representatives) of such Subsidiary Guarantor of such demand.
Demand for Payment
          Section 12.05. . If a distribution is made to Securityholders that because of this Article 12 should not have been made to them, the Securityholders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of the relevant Senior Indebtedness and pay it over to them or their Representative as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
          Section 12.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Securityholders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article 12 to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Securityholders is not, as between the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, a payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
          Section 12.07. . This Article 12 defines the relative rights of Securityholders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
 
     (1) impair, as between such Subsidiary Guarantor and Securityholders, the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the Obligations to the extent set forth in Article 11; or
     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Securityholder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to receive distributions otherwise payable to Securityholders.
          Section 12.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Subsidiary Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Subsidiary Guarantor
          Section 12.09. . Notwithstanding Section 12.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent may continue to make payments pursuant to any Subsidiary Guarantee and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Trust Officer of the Trustee receives written notice satisfactory to it that payments may not be made under this Article 12. The Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Registrar or co-registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor may give the notice; , , that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative may give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
provided
however
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and co-registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 12 with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor; and nothing in Article 7 shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article 12 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07.
          Section 12.10. . Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
          Section 12.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to a Subsidiary Guarantee by reason of any provision in this Article 12 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a default under such Subsidiary Guarantee. Nothing in this Article 12 shall have any effect on the right of the Securityholders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its Subsidiary Guarantee.
Article 12 Not To Prevent Defaults Under a Subsidiary Guarantee or Limit Right To Demand Payment
          Section 12.12. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall be entitled to rely (i) upon
Trustee Entitled To Rely
 
any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 12.02 are pending, (ii) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Securityholders or (iii) upon the Representative for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 12. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 12, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 12, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.02 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article 12.
          Section 12.13. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Securityholders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor as provided in this Article 12 and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee To Effectuate Subordination
          Section 12.14. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Securityholders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 12 or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Subsidiary Guarantor
          Section 12.15. . Each Securityholder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization are Events of Default which shall result in the Securities being due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default. A default under clauses (iv), (v), (vii) or (viii) shall not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities notifies the Company of the default and the Company does not cure such default within the time specified after receipt of such notice.
          Securityholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.

17.
No Recourse Against Others
          A director, officer, employee, stockholder, incorporator, or member, as such, of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Securities, any Subsidiary Guarantee, or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Securityholder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
