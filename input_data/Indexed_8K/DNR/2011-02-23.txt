Exhibit 99.1
News Release Released at 7:30 AM CST
     PLANO, Texas  February 23, 2011  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial and operating results.
     Fourth quarter 2010 net income was $10.4 million, or $0.03 per basic common share, as compared to $3.5 million, or $0.01 per basic common share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results included the following unusual or non-cash items:
     Net income adjusted to exclude these four items would have been approximately $86.9 million, or $0.22 per basic common share in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to adjusted net income of $45.8 million, or $0.18 per basic common share in the prior year fourth quarter, after adjustments for changes in the fair value of derivatives and Encore merger related expenses in the 2009 period (see the accompanying schedules for a reconciliation of "net income" as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to the non-GAAP measure "adjusted net income").
     The Company reported net income for the full year 2010 of $271.7 million, or $0.73 per basic common share, as compared to a net loss of $75.2 million, or $0.30 per basic common share in 2009. Net income adjusted principally to exclude non-cash gains and losses in the fair value of commodity derivatives, the gain on sale of interests in Genesis and Encore transaction related costs was $229.8 million, or $0.62 per basic common share in 2010, as compared to adjusted net income of $174.0 million, or $0.70 per basic common share in 2009 after adjustment for non-cash fair value commodity derivative gains and losses and other lesser non-recurring items (see the accompanying schedules for a reconciliation of the GAAP measure "net income" to the non-GAAP measure "adjusted net income").
     Adjusted cash flow from operations (cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities, a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $247.5 million, as compared to adjusted cash flow of $151.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow provided by operations, the GAAP measure, totaled $263.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to $124.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted cash flow and cash flow from operations differ in that the latter measure includes the changes in receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the quarter (see the accompanying schedules for a reconciliation of the GAAP measure "net cash flow provided by operations," to "adjusted cash flow from operations," which is the non-GAAP measure discussed above).
 
Production
     During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company's oil and natural gas production averaged 76,435 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("BOE/d"), compared to 45,012 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2009. This 31,423 BOE/d of additional production is primarily attributable to (1) properties acquired in the Encore Merger, which contributed average production of 31,726 BOE/d during the quarter, and (2) tertiary production increasing 4,832 barrels per day ("Bbls/d") between the two quarters. Offsetting these production increases was a decrease of 5,042 BOE/d due to the December 2009 sale of the Company's remaining Barnett Shale properties. Excluding the production attributable to the sale in December 2010 of the Haynesville and East Texas natural gas assets and the Company's ownership interests in Encore Energy Partners ("ENP"), the Company's adjusted fourth quarter 2010 production would have been 63,712 BOE/d, an increase of 59% over adjusted fourth quarter 2009 production of 39,970 (adjusted to exclude production from the Barnett Shale properties sold in the fourth quarter of 2009). The Company's Bakken production for the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged 5,193 BOE/d, a 12% increase over third quarter of 2010 Bakken production levels.
     Production from the Company's tertiary operations averaged 31,139 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 29,062 Bbls/d for the full year 2010, an 18% increase over the 26,307 Bbls/d average in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 19% increase over 2009's annual average tertiary production and a 5% sequential increase over average tertiary production in the third quarter of 2010. Strong sequential tertiary production increases were noted at Heidelberg (22%), Brookhaven (11%), Tinsley (10%), Cranfield (22%) and Delhi (38%) over production in the prior quarter.
Review of Financial Results
     The Company's fourth quarter oil and natural gas revenues, excluding any impact of derivative contracts, increased 93% as compared to revenues in the prior year quarter, as the higher production levels discussed above increased revenues by 70%, while higher commodity prices increased revenues by 23%. Oil and natural gas revenues per barrel of oil equivalent ("BOE"), excluding the impact of any derivative contracts, was 14% higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 than in the fourth quarter of 2009 ($73.04 per BOE as compared to $64.18 per BOE) and was 15% higher when including derivative settlements in the comparative fourth quarters ($73.79 per BOE as compared to $64.27 per BOE).
     On an annual basis, the Company's oil and natural gas revenues in 2010, excluding any impact of derivative contracts, increased 107% over 2009 levels. Oil and natural gas revenues per BOE, excluding any impact of derivative contracts, were 37% higher in 2010 versus 2009 ($67.37 per BOE as compared to $49.16 per BOE) and were 15% higher when including derivative settlements ($65.81 per BOE as compared to $57.48 per BOE).
     The Company received $15.4 million on its derivative contract settlements in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to cash receipts of $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2009. Derivative contract settlements received during the fourth quarter of 2010 included $10.0 million received in settlements to terminate certain of the Company's 2011 natural gas swaps after the sale of the Haynesville and East Texas properties.
     The Company recorded a pre-tax $129.6 million non-cash fair value charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to fair value changes on its commodity and interest rate swap derivative contracts as compared to a pre-tax $59.5 million non-cash fair value loss in the fourth quarter of 2009.
     Company-wide oil price differentials (Denbury's net oil price received as compared to NYMEX prices) in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $3.90 per barrel of oil below NYMEX, a slightly wider differential than in the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to the addition of the Encore acquired properties which typically have a higher oil price differential than Denbury's legacy properties. The Company's oil price differential in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $3.44 per Bbl below NYMEX, which included a significant amount of Barnett Shale natural gas liquids production that received prices significantly below NYMEX oil prices.
 
     Lease operating expenses increased 56% on an absolute basis between the two fourth quarters, but decreased 8% on a per BOE basis. The increase on an absolute basis is primarily due to the March 2010 Encore acquisition and further expansion of the Company's tertiary operations, partially offset by the December 2009 sale of the remaining Barnett Shale properties. When comparing the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, the Company's largest increases in lease operating expenses (excluding the increases associated with the Encore acquisition) were related to CO expense and power and utilities as a result of the expansion of tertiary operations. The overall decrease on a per BOE basis was primarily due to those properties which were part of the Encore acquisition generally having a lower operating cost per BOE than Denbury's legacy properties. Denbury's tertiary operating expense averaged $22.26 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to $22.03 per Bbl in the prior year fourth quarter, and as compared to $22.54 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2010. Production taxes and marketing expenses increased during the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to fourth quarter of 2009 levels, primarily as a result of higher oil prices and production and the Encore properties which generally have higher production taxes.

     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses totaled $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $27.8 million in the prior year quarter. On a per BOE basis, G&A expense was $5.50 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $6.78 in the prior year quarter. This decrease in the rate per BOE was primarily attributable to increased production. During the quarter, the Company incurred $13.0 million of transaction and other expenses associated with the Encore acquisition, primarily associated with employee severance. These merger-related fees are included in the Company's income statement under the caption "Transaction costs and other related to the Encore merger."
     During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company capitalized approximately $10.7 million of interest expense as compared to $19.9 million capitalized during the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease between the two quarters is associated with the first phase of the Green Pipeline project which was placed into service at the end of the second quarter of 2010, at which time interest capitalization on that portion of this capital project ceased. Interest expense, net of the amount capitalized, increased significantly between the respective fourth quarters, due to the higher debt levels in the current year quarter as a result of the Encore merger.
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $15.87 per BOE as compared to $14.77 per BOE in the prior year quarter. The incremental DD&A per BOE is due primarily to the merger with Encore in March 2010.
     The Company's income tax provision is based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38%. However, the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2010 effective tax rates were higher, as compared to its estimated statutory rate, due to the recognition of additional deferred tax expense resulting from asset dispositions and a corporate legal entity restructuring that occurred on December 31, 2010 ($4.5 million) and the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the date of the Encore Merger (approximately $10 million). The December 31, 2010 legal entity restructuring provides the Company with various operational efficiencies and other economic benefits that will be realized over time.
2011 Outlook
     Denbury's capital expenditures budget for 2011 remains at $1.1 billion ($1.2 billion including capitalized interest and tertiary start up costs at Hastings and Oyster Bayou Fields during 2011).
     Phil Rykhoek, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our fourth quarter production, reserves and financial results were on or ahead of schedule, putting the final touches on an exceptional 2010 for Denbury. We begin 2011 with a strong balance sheet, plenty of liquidity and, to date, strong oil prices. Although not a big factor in the fourth quarter, we also expect to benefit from the strong Light Louisiana Sweet market in the first part of 2011, as we are fortunate to have a significant portion of our crude sales based on that index. Our first seven weeks of 2011 have gotten off to a slightly slower start than we would have liked due to the harsh winter, particularly in the Bakken area, but we expect to recover quickly and believe we will achieve our 2011 targets. We expect another great year as we continue to build on our profitable lower-risk oil platform."

Non-GAAP Measures
     Adjusted net income excluding certain items is a non-GAAP measure. This measure reflects net income without regard to the fair value adjustments on the Company's derivative contracts or other certain items. The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately as it is a better reflection of the ongoing comparable results of the Company, without regard to changes in the market value of the Company's derivative contracts during the period or other certain items.
     Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as summarized from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Adjusted cash flow from operations measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables. The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately, as it believes it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in its business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs and so forth, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that period.
     Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a growing independent oil and natural gas company. The Company is the largest oil and natural gas producer in both Mississippi and Montana, owns the largest reserves of CO used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and holds significant operating acreage in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast Regions. The Company's goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling, and proven engineering extraction practices, with its most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations.
