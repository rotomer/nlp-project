Section 7  Regulation FD Disclosure
     
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
As announced by Elk Petroleum Ltd (ASX: ELK) ("Elk") on May 9, 2011 in Australia, Denbury Onshore LLC has signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Elk to acquire a 65% working interest in Grieve Field, a planned CO EOR Project located in Natrona County, Wyoming. Denbury will serve as operator and invest the first $28.5 million of capital and operating costs in Phase 1. In Phase 2, Denbury may fund, at Elk's option, Elk's 35% share of the next $34.3 million of capital and operating costs, with Denbury recouping its Phase 2 expenditures (plus interest) out of Elk's 35% working interest share of production from the project. Elk has the right, at its discretion, to elect to fund its share of Phase 2 expenditures. All future costs beyond Phase 2 will be borne by the each company in proportion to its respective working interests.

Denbury will own and construct the CO recycling facility and the necessary 3-mile pipeline to deliver CO from an existing CO pipeline to the Grieve Field. Upon completion of the construction of the pipeline and CO recycling facility, Denbury will charge Grieve Field a monthly lease fee and all routine operating costs associated with the pipeline and recycling facility for the life of the project. Denbury estimates that the Grieve CO EOR project has potential for recovery of approximately 12 million barrels ("MMBbls") of gross oil, or 6.4 MMBbls net to Denbury's net revenue interest. In the event the project recovers greater than 12 MMBbls of oil, gross, Denbury will assign Elk an additional 1.3% of net revenue interest in the project.

Denbury expects to close the transaction within 30 days following customary due diligence, finalization of the necessary lease agreements associated with the pipeline, and recycling facility and customary consents and approvals for transactions of this nature.
