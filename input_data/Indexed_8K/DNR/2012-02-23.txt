Exhibit 99.1
 February 23, 2012  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced record quarterly adjusted net income of $175 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, or $0.45 per diluted share, on record quarterly revenues of $612 million.  This compares to $87 million of adjusted net income, or $0.22 per diluted share, on revenues of $519 million for the prior year fourth quarter, and $148 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, on revenues of $572 million for the third quarter of 2011.  Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), fourth quarter of 2011 net income was $53 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. This compares to $10 million of net income, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the prior year fourth quarter, and $276 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011.

Adjusted cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was a quarterly record $387 million. This compares to $248 million of the same measure for the prior year fourth quarter, and $358 million for the third quarter of 2011.  GAAP net cash provided by operating activities was $366 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.  This compares to $263 million of the same measure for the prior year fourth quarter and $316 million for the third quarter of 2011.

Phil Rykhoek, Denburys President and CEO, commented, "We finished 2011 with strong financial performance, attaining new record levels of quarterly revenue and adjusted cash flow.  Solid production volumes, favorable oil pricing, and a sequential quarterly reduction in lease operating expenses all contributed to our record performance.  Our oil price differentials in the fourth quarter were our best ever, with our net oil price averaging in excess of $9 per barrel higher than NYMEX oil prices.  With the earlier than anticipated startups of our Oyster Bayou and Hastings Fields, and a positive start to our 2012 Bakken production, our year-to-date 2012 average oil production from both our tertiary and Bakken operations is above expectations.  Our liquidity position is strong and we are well positioned to execute our unique, highly profitable, lower-risk, and long-term oil production growth strategy.

Production
 
Fourth quarter of 2011 production averaged 67,234 BOE/d, down from 76,435 BOE/d produced in the prior year period, but up from the 66,830 BOE/d produced in the third quarter of 2011.  The 9,201 BOE/d decrease from the prior year fourth quarter was primarily attributable to the sale of assets in 2010, partially offset by an increase in Bakken production.  For comparative purposes, the Companys adjusted fourth quarter of 2010 production would have been 63,712 BOE/d if production attributable to assets sold in 2010 were excluded.  Included in the fourth quarter of 2011 production volumes are 1,677 BOE/d from non-core Gulf Coast assets which Denbury has agreed to sell in a transaction expected to close in the first quarter of 2012.
Fourth quarter of 2011 production from tertiary operations averaged 31,144 barrels of oil per day (Bbls/d), and 30,959 Bbls/d for the year.  Full year 2011 tertiary production increased by 7% from the full year 2010 level while fourth quarter of 2011 tertiary production was little changed from both the prior year fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2011.  The quarterly comparisons reflect production gains from the expanding tertiary floods at the Delhi and Heidelberg Fields being offset by declines at more mature tertiary floods and the Tinsley Field.  Driven by an active development program, Bakken production increased to 11,743 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 126% increase from the prior year fourth quarter level, and an 18% increase from the third quarter of 2011 level.
Review of Financial Results
 
The Companys fourth quarter of 2011 oil and natural gas revenues, excluding any impact of derivative contracts, increased 18% compared to revenues in the prior year fourth quarter.  Higher oil prices and improved oil differentials increased revenues by 30%.  These pricing improvements were partially offset by lower production levels as a result of 2010 asset sales which decreased revenues by 12%.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, 94% of the Companys production was oil, compared to 85% in the prior year fourth quarter.  This increase was primarily due to the higher Bakken oil production in the 2011 period, coupled with the sale of certain assets in 2010 which produced a relatively high percentage of natural gas.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Denburys oil price differentials (the average price at which the Company sold its production compared to NYMEX prices) continued to improve significantly, primarily due to the relative strength of Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS") index pricing.  Company-wide oil price differentials in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $9.14 per barrel (Bbl) above NYMEX prices, as compared to $3.90 per Bbl below NYMEX in the prior year fourth quarter.  For the fourth quarter of 2011, the LLS index differential averaged a positive $23.36 per Bbl on a trade-month basis, as compared to a positive $4.07 per Bbl in the prior year fourth quarter.  The LLS to NYMEX differential had decreased significantly by end of 2011 to slightly less than $10 per barrel positive to NYMEX.  During 2011, the Company sold approximately 45% of its crude oil based on the LLS index price and approximately 28% based on NYMEX prices, with the balance based on various other indexes.
Lease operating expenses increased 11% on a per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis between the fourth quarter of 2010 and fourth quarter of 2011.  The overall increase from the prior year fourth quarter was primarily due to certain sales during the 2010 period of properties which had a lower production cost per BOE than Denburys legacy assets.  Higher tertiary operating expenses also contributed to the increase.  Tertiary operating expenses averaged $23.59 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to $21.73 per Bbl in the prior year fourth quarter.  The increase between the periods was primarily due to higher fuel, utilities, labor and workover costs, which were partly the result of higher costs at the Heidelberg and Tinsley Fields.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to $38 million in the prior year fourth quarter.  The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in third-party professional services, savings in office rent, lower bonus accrual, and an increase in capitalized exploration and development expenses.  On a per BOE basis, G&A expense was $4.51 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $5.36 in the prior year fourth quarter.
Interest expense declined 32% in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to the prior year fourth quarter, due in part to a $9 million increase in capitalized interest, a $179 million decrease in average debt outstanding and a modest reduction in the average interest rate, to 7.8% from 8.1%.  The increase in capitalized interest between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2011 was primarily the result of incremental capitalized interest on projects under construction, particularly the Riley Ridge facility and Greencore pipeline.
 
 
 
     Depletion, depreciation and amortization of oil and natural gas properties was $16.18 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $14.33 per BOE in the prior year fourth quarter.  The increase was primarily due to higher costs per barrel associated with the Companys 2011 Bakken capital program and upward revisions in estimated future development costs primarily related to Bakken proved undeveloped properties.  The increase was partially offset by the impact of the Companys incremental acquisition of Riley Ridge reserves in 2011, which were purchased at a relatively low cost per BOE.
   
 
     Denbury recorded a pre-tax $167 million non-cash fair value charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to decreases in the fair value of its derivative contracts, as compared to a pre-tax $130 million non-cash fair value charge in the prior year fourth quarter.  The Company received cash of $7 million from derivative contract settlements in the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to $15 million received during the prior year fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter of 2010 amounts included $10 million received from terminating certain of the Companys natural gas swaps after applicable asset sales.
   
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $23 million, $6 million of which related to the decline in market value at December 31, 2011 of the Vanguard common units the Company sold in January 2012, and $17 million of which related to the impairment of the Companys investment in a potential natural source of CO, which, after evaluation, was determined to be uneconomic.
2
Denburys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was approximately 34%, lower than the estimated 38% statutory tax rate due to differences between the Companys tax provision and filed tax returns.  The Companys annual effective tax rate for 2011 was 38%.
2012 Guidance
 
Denburys 2012 production guidance is unchanged as follows:
* Includes 1,400 BOE/d from properties Denbury has agreed to sell for $155 million in a transaction expected to close in the first quarter of 2012.  These properties produced an average of 1,805 BOE/d in 2011.
Denburys 2012 capital expenditure budget is also unchanged at $1.35 billion, excluding acquisitions, capitalized interest and tertiary startup costs and net of a projected $75 million of equipment sale/leasebacks.
Expense Reclassifications
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company adjusted its presentation of certain expense items in its Consolidated Statements of Operations.  A new expense item, taxes other than income, was created and includes severance taxes (previously included in production taxes and marketing expenses), ad valorem taxes (previously included in lease operating expenses and CO discovery and operating expenses) and franchise and other miscellaneous taxes (previously included in general and administrative expenses).  All prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation.  The fourth quarter and full year 2011 account balances were as follows prior to the reclassifications:

Non-GAAP Measures
 
Adjusted net income excluding certain items is a non-GAAP measure.  This measure reflects net income without regard to the fair value adjustments on the Companys derivative contracts or other certain items.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately as it is a better reflection of the ongoing comparable results of the Company, without regard to changes in the market value of the Companys derivative contracts or other certain items during the period.
Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as summarized from the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Adjusted cash flow from operations measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately, as it believes it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in its business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs and so forth, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that period.
