DENBURY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
 May 3, 2012  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced adjusted net income of $161 million for the first quarter of 2012, or $0.41 per diluted share, on record quarterly revenues of $640 million.  This compares to $104 million of adjusted net income, or $0.26 per diluted share, on revenues of $511 million for the prior year first quarter, and $175 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, on revenues of $612 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.  Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), first quarter of 2012 net income was $113 million, or $0.29 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the prior year first quarter, and net income of $53 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2011.

Additional highlights subsequent to the first quarter of 2012:
Phil Rykhoek, Denburys President and CEO, commented, "We are off to a strong start in 2012 as production from our tertiary oil and Bakken operations both reached new record levels in the first quarter.  We expect continued tertiary production growth in 2012, while the rate of our Bakken production growth is expected to slow as we reduce our operated rig count in the area to four by mid-year from a peak of seven in 2011.  As a result of our strong start to the year, we expect that our tertiary and total production will both be in the upper half of our estimated 2012 production ranges.  Our quarterly revenue reached a new record level in the first quarter, increasing approximately 5% from fourth quarter 2011 levels, as higher oil production and NYMEX oil prices offset the impact of lower oil price differentials.  With our asset sales complete, the positive start to the year and a favorable outlook, we have increased our 2012 capital budget by $150 million to $1.5 billion. The additional expenditures will primarily be split between our Bakken development program and tertiary floods.  The additional spending will have an impact on our Bakken production late in 2012 and early 2013, while the higher tertiary spending will benefit 2013 production.  Our recently announced acquisition of Thompson Field will allow us to further expand our leading position in Gulf Coast enhanced oil recovery and capitalize on the significant investments we have made in CO supply and infrastructure in the region.  We remain focused on executing our unique, highly profitable, lower-risk, and long-term oil production growth strategy.

Production
 
First quarter of 2012 production averaged 71,532 BOE/d, up 12% from 63,604 BOE/d produced in the prior year period, and up 6% from the 67,234 BOE/d produced in the fourth quarter of 2011.  The comparative quarterly increases were the result of gains in Bakken and tertiary production, which were offset by reductions in conventional production and the impact of non-core asset sales.  Included in first quarter 2012 production volumes are 1,762 BOE/d from non-core assets which Denbury sold in transactions that closed in late February and early April 2012.  These same divested properties contributed 2,553 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2011 and 2,330 BOE/d of production in the fourth quarter of 2011.
First quarter of 2012 production from tertiary operations averaged 33,257 Bbls/d, an 8% increase from the prior year first quarter level, and a 7% increase from the fourth quarter of 2011 level.  The growth in tertiary production was driven by contributions from new floods at Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields and existing floods at Tinsley and Delhi fields.  Bakken production increased to 15,114 BOE/d in the first quarter of 2012, a 164% increase from the prior year first quarter level, and a 29% increase from the fourth quarter of 2011 level.  The rapid growth in Bakken production is a result of Denburys active drilling program in the region.
Review of Financial Results
 
Denburys first quarter of 2012 oil and natural gas revenues, excluding the impact of derivative contracts, increased 25% compared to revenues in the prior year first quarter, with a 14% increase due to higher production and an 11% increase from higher realized oil prices.  During the first quarter of 2012, 93% of the Companys production was oil which was little changed from the prior year first quarter level of 92%.
 
 
 
 
 
Denburys oil price differential (the average price at which the Company sold its production compared to NYMEX prices) improved modestly from the prior year first quarter level as improvements in the Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS") index premium were partly offset by widening Bakken differentials.  Company-wide oil price differentials in the first quarter were $0.37 per Bbl below NYMEX prices, compared to $0.59 per Bbl below NYMEX in the prior year first quarter.  For the first quarter of 2012, the LLS index differential averaged a positive $12.55 per Bbl on a trade-month basis, compared to a positive $9.28 per Bbl in the prior year first quarter.  In the Bakken, differentials averaged $16.96 per Bbl below NYMEX in the first quarter of 2012, down from $11.55 per Bbl in the prior year first quarter.  By the end of the first quarter of 2012, both differentials had improved, with the LLS to NYMEX premium increasing and Bakken to NYMEX discount shrinking.  During the first quarter of 2012, the Company sold approximately 40% of its crude oil at prices based on the LLS index price, approximately 20% at prices tied to a combination of the LLS index price and other indexes, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region.
Lease operating expenses decreased 2% on a per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis between the first quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2012.  The decrease from the prior year first quarter was primarily due to increased Bakken production and the sale of non-core Gulf Coast properties during the first quarter of 2012 which had relatively high operating costs per BOE.  These benefits more than offset higher tertiary operating expenses which averaged $26.74 per Bbl in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $24.93 per Bbl in the prior year first quarter.  The increase in tertiary operating expenses between the periods was primarily due to the start up of new tertiary floods at Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields.  Operating costs per barrel at these new tertiary oil fields are expected to decline as production from these new fields increase.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $37 million, or $5.62 per BOE, in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $42 million, or $7.39 per BOE, in the prior year first quarter.  The decrease on a per BOE basis was driven by lower G&A expense and higher production.  The decrease in G&A expense was due primarily to lower office related expenses and professional fees and an increase in capitalized exploration and development expenses, offset in part by higher compensation expense.
Interest expense declined by 26% in the first quarter of 2012 to $36 million, compared to $49 million in the prior year first quarter, as the benefit of an $8 million increase in capitalized interest and reduction in the average interest rate to 7.6% from 8.6% was offset by a $230 million increase in average debt outstanding.  The increase in capitalized interest between the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 was primarily the result of incremental capitalized interest on projects under construction, particularly the Riley Ridge facility, Greencore Pipeline, and Conroe Field.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization of oil and natural gas properties was $16.71 per BOE in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $14.61 per BOE in the prior year first quarter.  The increase was primarily due to higher finding costs per barrel associated with the Companys Bakken assets and upward revisions in estimated future development costs primarily in the Bakken.
Denbury recorded a pre-tax $44 million non-cash fair value charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2012 due to decreases in the fair value of its derivative contracts, compared to a pre-tax $172 million non-cash fair value charge in the prior year first quarter.
During the first quarter of 2012, Denbury recorded total pre-tax asset impairment charges of $17 million, $15 million of which related to an investment in a proposed plant from which the Company would purchase CO, with the remainder related to a CO property in the Rocky Mountain region.   Also in the first quarter of 2012, Denbury recorded a pre-tax loss of $3 million on the sale of its Vanguard units, a $4 million charge related to an expected delay in delivery of helium under a supply agreement as a result of the delay in initial natural gas and helium sales at its Riley Ridge facility, and a $4 million allowance related to a loan receivable tied to future payments from natural gas producing wells acquired in the Encore acquisition.

Denburys effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was approximately 37%, slightly lower than the estimated 38% statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the Companys sale of its Vanguard units in January 2012, which allowed the Company to utilize a larger amount of preferential tax benefits.
 
 
 
 
 
2012 Production Estimates and Capital Expenditures
 
Denburys estimated 2012 production has been updated as follows:
 
* Does not include the contribution from properties Denbury agreed to acquire for $360 million in a transaction expected to close in June 2012.  Daily net production from these assets is currently estimated at approximately 2,200 Bbls/d.
Overall, the Company is leaving its 2012 production estimates unchanged but has adjusted production estimates for the Bakken and Other production categories.  The Companys Bakken production range was increased by 1,600 BOE/d primarily due to more favorable than expected production to date from the area while the Other production category was reduced by 1,600 BOE/d due to the delayed start up of the Riley Ridge gas processing plant as the Company makes certain modifications identified during a pre-startup safety review.  The Company now expects first production from Riley Ridge in the fourth quarter of 2012, which had previously been targeted for the second quarter of 2012.  The adjustments to production estimates are expected to have a net positive impact on targeted 2012 revenues and cash flows, as previously projected natural gas production from Riley Ridge has been replaced primarily by oil production from the Bakken.
Denburys 2012 capital expenditure budget has been increased by $150 million to $1.5 billion.  This amount excludes acquisitions, capitalized interest and tertiary start-up costs and is net of a projected $75 million of equipment sale/leasebacks.  The increase is primarily split between Denburys Bakken properties and tertiary floods.  In the Bakken, Denbury increased its projected capital spending from $400 million to $480 million, as it now plans to keep a fourth operated rig running in the second half of the year.  Additional expenditures on tertiary floods will primarily accelerate projects previously planned for 2013.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure.  This measure reflects net income without regard to the fair value adjustments on the Companys derivative contracts or other certain items that are generally non-cash and unusual or non-recurring in nature and are typically excluded by the investment community in preparing its published estimates.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately as it is a better reflection of the ongoing comparable results of the Company, without regard to changes during the period in the market value of the Companys derivative contracts or other typically excluded items.
Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as summarized from the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Adjusted cash flow from operations measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately, as it believes it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in its business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs and so forth, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that period.
PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure and is different than the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows ("Standardized Measure") in that PV-10 is a pre-tax number, while the Standardized Measure includes the effect of estimated future income taxes.
