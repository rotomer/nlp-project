Item 5.03  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
 
Amendment of Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
At the Companys annual meeting of stockholders held May 15, 2012, stockholders approved the proposal to amend the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to delete subsection D. of Article VIII to eliminate the requirement that a two-thirds supermajority of our Board of Directors approve certain acquisitions and dispositions, issuances of debt or equity, or changes in our board size or governing documents.  A copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Amended and Restated Bylaws
 
On May 15, 2012, the Board of Directors of Denbury Resources Inc. (the Company) amended and restated the Companys bylaws effective immediately after the Companys 2012 annual meeting held on May 15, 2012. The Companys bylaws were amended and restated primarily to (i) change the voting standard for uncontested director elections from a plurality to one in which directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast, (ii) revise the advance notice provisions for stockholders proposing business or nominating directors, (iii) add procedural and disclosure requirements for stockholders proposing business or nominating directors, calling special meetings or taking action by written consent, and (iv) update and modernize other bylaw provisions, including revisions related to the use of modern electronic communication technologies.
In particular, the changes to the bylaws include:
1.      A new section 3.16, which provides that director nominees in uncontested Board elections will be elected by a majority of the votes cast by stockholders, meaning that votes for a nominees election exceed the votes against or withheld for that nominee.  The provision also requires that in a contested election, directors are to be elected by a plurality of votes cast.  Further, incumbent directors must provide an irrevocable resignation in order to be nominated, which resignation becomes effective only if a director is not re-elected at a meeting with majority voting in place, and a majority of the Board (excluding those not re-elected) accepts the resignation.
In conjunction with adoption of this new majority election of directors provision, which will apply to the Companys 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company has amended its corporate governance policies to provide that in the case of an incumbent director not receiving the vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which such director is nominated for re-election, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider, and make a recommendation to the Companys Board regarding, whether to accept or reject such nominees irrevocable offer of resignation, or whether to take other action regarding such offer of resignation, and the Companys Board is to act on such offer of resignation within 90 days from the certification of such election results, and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale for the same.  No incumbent director failing to receive a majority of votes cast for their re-election may participate in any of such proceedings.
2.      Establishment of new advance notice and related procedural and disclosure requirements, which require advance notice of a stockholder or beneficial owner (a proposing person) proposing business or nominating directors in connection with annual or special meetings of stockholders, along with compliance with procedural requirements and provision of information regarding the proposing  person or proposed business, the proposing  persons ownership of referenced securities of the Company (including derivative interests) and related information.  Similar requirements are imposed in the event of stockholders demanding a special meeting of stockholders or taking action by written consent.
3.      Amendments and clarifications to provisions regarding directors, board committees and officers, including designation of officers that comport with the Companys historical and current practices, with added flexibility regarding officer appointments and creation of board committees.
4.      Updated and modernized provisions in light of changes made to the Delaware General Corporation Law over recent years, including modifications to provisions on notice, record dates, consents, proxies, voting procedures and meeting participation, and changes to accommodate use of modern communication technologies.

Delivery shall occur as set forth in Section 2.11(a).  If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

(c) An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section 2.11; , , that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation can determine (i) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder, and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission.  The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.  No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware or its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to the corporations registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
