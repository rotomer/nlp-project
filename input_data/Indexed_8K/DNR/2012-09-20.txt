Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 September 20, 2012  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Bakken assets in North Dakota and Montana to Exxon Mobil Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. (collectively, ExxonMobil).  Denbury will receive $1.6 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments, and ExxonMobils operating interests in Webster Field in Texas and Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming, both of which are ideal candidates for carbon dioxide (CO) flooding and close to Denburys existing or planned CO pipelines.  In addition, Denbury has agreed in principle to either purchase an interest in the CO reserves in ExxonMobils LaBarge Field in southwestern Wyoming or purchase incremental CO from that field, on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by the parties.  The purchase of an interest in CO reserves would reduce the amount of cash received by Denbury.

The transactions are subject to satisfactory completion of customary title and environmental due diligence, as well as the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and, in the case of the LaBarge Field CO transaction, the entering into of definitive agreements.  The transactions are expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2012 with a July 1, 2012 effective date. The sale price is subject to standard adjustments for revenues and costs of the respective assets from the effective date to the closing date.

Denbury intends to use the cash proceeds from the transaction to pursue the purchase of additional oil fields in the Gulf Coast or Rocky Mountain regions that are suited for CO flooding, to fund capital expenditures, and/or to repay outstanding debt under its bank credit facility.  Additionally, Denbury plans to resume its stock repurchase program begun in October 2011 under which $195 million of the $500 million of authorized repurchases have been made.  Assuming no additional assets are acquired with the cash proceeds in a manner that would qualify for like-kind exchange treatment for federal income tax purposes, Denbury estimates that its after-tax cash proceeds from the transaction (without giving effect to closing adjustments) will be approximately $1.1 billion.

Proved reserves attributed to Denburys Bakken assets being sold were approximately 96 million barrels of oil equivalent as of December 31, 2011 and were 84% oil and natural gas liquids and 26% proved developed producing.  Average production from the properties in the first half of 2012 was about 15,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which 88% was oil and natural gas liquids.  Denburys previously issued 2012 annual production guidance assumed average daily production from the Bakken properties of between 14,350 BOE/d and 16,350 BOE/d.

Management Comment
 
Phil Rykhoek, Denburys President and CEO, commented, "We acquired our Bakken assets in the 2010 Encore acquisition.  We are pleased with our development activities in the Bakken, which have increased the value of these assets from very little at the time of the acquisition to their current value of nearly $2 billion.  This trade allows us to realize that value and leverage our Bakken position to acquire two of the top oil fields in our core operating regions that are candidates for CO flooding, while also adding incremental CO resources in the Rocky Mountain region and increasing liquidity by over $1 billion.  We can now focus on what Denbury does best, CO enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which we believe offers one of the most compelling rates of return in the oil and gas industry today.

This trade illustrates our CO EOR strategy wherein we start with a large anchor oil field, acquire or build the necessary CO supply and transportation infrastructure, and then acquire other oil fields in the expansion area that we can flood with CO.  This concept works particularly well for the incremental acquisitions, which generally have better economics since the significant infrastructure dollars are already invested and only minor CO pipeline expansions are required.  Webster Field will become the fifth acquired Texas oil field since we began our expansion into the state with the construction of the Green Pipeline completed in 2010.  Hartzog Draw Field marks our first significant oil field acquisition in the Rocky Mountain region since we entered the area with our 2010 acquisition of Encore.  Combined, these two fields will add an estimated 80 million to 105 million barrels of potentially recoverable oil to our existing CO flood inventory.  We are also pleased to have the opportunity to secure additional CO, which will allow us to accelerate the development of Hartzog Draw Field and potentially defer a portion of our planned Riley Ridge development.

We are continuing to pursue other oil field acquisitions that may qualify for like-kind exchange treatment for federal income tax purposes, although based upon marketplace conditions at this time, we currently do not expect to use a substantial portion of the cash proceeds for this purpose.  We initially expect to pay down our outstanding bank debt with a portion of the transaction proceeds.  We also plan to renew our stock repurchase program, as we deem appropriate.  We are reviewing our development plans in light of this trade and may consider revising the order and timing of our future CO floods.  With the sale of the Bakken assets, we will have even more control over the timing and magnitude of our capital expenditures, as we operate all of our remaining significant assets.  We are excited about this trade as we continue to enhance and improve our already profitable CO EOR strategy.

Conference Call and Presentation
 
Denbury management will discuss the transaction on a conference call that is scheduled for today, September 20, 2012 at 10:00 A.M. (Central).  Interested parties are invited to listen to a live broadcast of the conference call that will be accessible through the Companys website at www.denbury.com.

Denbury Resources Inc. is a growing independent oil and natural gas company. The Company is the largest combined oil and natural gas operator in both Mississippi and Montana, owns the largest reserves of CO used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and holds significant operating acreage in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions. The Company's goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with its most significant emphasis relating to tertiary oil recovery operations.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including estimated oil reserve potential, original oil in place, future volumes recoverable with a CO flood, daily production volumes of the acquired assets, after-tax cash proceeds from property sales, and other risks and uncertainties detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Denbury's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties are incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein. These statements are based on engineering, geological, financial and operating assumptions that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and the Company's future performance are both subject to a wide range of business risks, and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Actual results may vary materially. The estimates of potential reserves in this press release, comprised of proved, probable and possible reserves based on the most recent drilling and technical data available to the Company, are more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering these reserves is subject to substantially greater risk.
