 November 6, 2012  Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE: DNR) ("Denbury" or the "Company") today announced adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) of $127 million for the third quarter of 2012, or $0.33 per diluted share, on quarterly revenues of $595 million.  This compares to $148 million of adjusted net income, or $0.37 per diluted share, on revenues of $572 million for the prior year third quarter, and $138 million of adjusted net income, or $0.35 per diluted share, on revenues of $597 million for the second quarter of 2012.  Third quarter of 2012 net income (a GAAP measure) was $85 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $276 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the prior year third quarter, and net income of $212 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2012.

Phil Rykhoek, Denburys President and CEO, commented, "Our 2012 production remains on track to be in the upper half of our estimated ranges and we expect to close our Bakken transaction around the end of November.  The Bakken transaction will sharpen our focus on our highly profitable CO EOR strategy and provides us with two additional oil fields in close proximity to our existing infrastructure that are well suited for CO EOR.  Our large inventory of CO EOR projects provides us with excellent visibility on relatively lower risk, long-term production growth, while our strong balance sheet and expected cash proceeds from the Bakken transaction give us a very high degree of financial flexibility.  Tertiary production was little changed from prior quarter levels, as continued strong growth at our newest floods at Hastings and Oyster Bayou was offset by Hurricane Isaac-related production shut-ins at several of our fields.  Although we experienced no significant damage from the storm, we did shut-in production at several of our Gulf Coast fields in preparation for the storm, which had a slight impact on our production results this quarter.  Importantly, our tertiary oil production has resumed its growth in the fourth quarter as we estimate it averaged over 36,000 barrels per day in October, a 3.5% increase over our average third quarter tertiary production.  Subsequent to announcing the Bakken transaction, we resumed our share repurchase program and have now bought back nearly 5% of our year-ago outstanding common shares under the $500 million program and still have nearly $230 million of remaining repurchases authorized.  Repurchases to date under the program effectively improve our per share metrics by about 5%.

Production
 
Third quarter of 2012 total production averaged 72,776 BOE/d with 93% of this production being oil.  Production increased by 9% from the prior year period level and by 1% from the second quarter of 2012 level. The sequential increase was the result of gains in production from the Companys Bakken area assets under contract to be sold offsetting minor declines in tertiary and conventional production. The year-ago increase was the result of gains in tertiary and Bakken production more than offsetting declines in conventional production and the net impact of asset sales and purchases.
Third quarter of 2012 production from tertiary operations averaged 34,786 Bbls/d, a 12% increase from the prior year third quarter level, and a 1% decrease from the second quarter of 2012 level.  The year-over-year growth in tertiary production was driven by contributions from new floods at Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields and existing floods at Tinsley, Heidelberg, and Delhi fields, which more than offset the impact of hurricane-related production shut-ins.  Production from the Companys Bakken area assets averaged 16,651 BOE/d in the third quarter of 2012, a 59% increase from the prior year third quarter level, and an 8% increase from the second quarter of 2012 level.  The rapid year-over-year growth in Bakken area production was a result of Denburys active drilling program in the region.  The slight sequential decrease in tertiary oil production from the second quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2012 was principally due to hurricane-related production shut-ins in August.
Review of Financial Results
 
Denburys third quarter of 2012 oil and natural gas revenues, excluding the impact of derivative contracts, increased by 4% from revenues in the prior year third quarter, as higher production drove a 9% increase in revenues, while lower realized oil and natural gas prices caused a 5% decrease in revenues.
Denburys oil price differential (the difference between the average price at which the Company sold its production and the average NYMEX price) declined from the prior year third quarter level as the Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS") index premium declined and Bakken differentials widened.  Company-wide oil price differentials in the third quarter of 2012 were $0.80 per barrel (Bbl) above NYMEX prices, compared to $7.25 per Bbl above NYMEX in the prior year third quarter.  The LLS premium decreased between the two periods resulting in an average premium of $10.61 per Bbl to NYMEX in the third quarter of 2012 for the Companys Gulf Coast tertiary oil production, down from a $14.84 per Bbl premium in the prior year third quarter.  Differentials for the Companys Bakken area production averaged $16.34 per Bbl below NYMEX in the third quarter of 2012, significantly wider than the $5.66 per Bbl below NYMEX realized in the prior year third quarter.  During the third quarter of 2012, the Company sold approximately 39% of its crude oil at prices based on the LLS index price, approximately 22% at prices partially tied to the LLS index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region.

Lease operating expenses decreased 10% on a per BOE basis to $19.49 per BOE in the third quarter of 2012 from $21.68 per BOE in the third quarter of 2011.  The decrease from the prior year third quarter level was primarily due to increased production from the Companys Bakken area assets and the sale of non-core Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain properties during the first half of 2012 (which had relatively high operating costs per BOE).  Tertiary operating expenses averaged $23.50 per Bbl in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $24.91 per Bbl in the prior year third quarter.  The decrease in tertiary operating expenses between the periods was primarily the result of the 12% increase in tertiary production which more than offset the additional costs related to operating new tertiary floods at Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $38 million, or $5.71 per BOE, in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $27 million, or $4.33 per BOE, in the prior year third quarter.  The increase in G&A expense was primarily due to a higher headcount, which resulted in higher compensation and employee-related costs along with a lower bonus accrual in the prior year period.
 
Interest expense in the third quarter of 2012 was $38 million, little changed from the prior year third quarter level.  The impact of a nearly $650 million increase in average debt outstanding from the third quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2012 was mostly offset by a reduction in average interest rate to 7% from 8.5% and a $2 million increase in capitalized interest.
 
Depletion, depreciation and amortization of oil and natural gas properties was $17.12 per BOE in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $14.91 per BOE in the prior year third quarter.  The increase was primarily due to higher finding and development costs per barrel and upward revisions to estimated future development costs associated with the Companys Bakken area assets.
Denbury recorded a pre-tax $68 million non-cash fair value loss in the third quarter of 2012 due to decreases in the fair value of its derivative contracts, compared to a pre-tax $206 million non-cash fair value gain in the prior year third quarter.  Pre-tax realized gains on hedges were $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a $4.6 million gain in the prior year third quarter.
2012 Production Estimates and Capital Expenditures
 
As previously announced, the Company has entered into an agreement to sell its Bakken area assets in a transaction expected to close around the end of November.  Not including the impact of the Bakken transaction, Denburys expected average 2012 production estimates are unchanged at the levels shown in the following table.
The Company continues to expect tertiary and total production to be in the upper half of estimated ranges.  This would represent an 11% to 16% increase in tertiary production from full-year 2011 levels.  Assuming the Bakken transaction closes at the end of November, estimated annual Bakken area production would be reduced by approximately 1,400 BOE/d, or about 1/12th of the areas estimated average daily production in the fourth quarter of 2012.  However, given the expected production contribution from the properties to be received in the Bakken transaction, the estimated total production range indicated above would be reduced by approximately 1,100 BOE/d.
 
Denburys 2012 capital expenditure budget remains at $1.5 billion, approximately two-thirds of which is for tertiary projects, with the remainder for the Bakken.  The budgeted amount excludes acquisitions, capitalized interest, and tertiary start-up costs and is net of estimated proceeds from equipment sale/leasebacks.  Of the $1.5 billion budgeted, slightly less than three-quarters had been spent through the third quarter of 2012.

Non-GAAP Measures
 
Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure.  This measure reflects net income without regard to the fair value adjustments on the Companys derivative contracts (the sole adjustment in the third quarter of 2012 comparative adjusted measure), or other certain items that are generally non-cash and unusual or non-recurring in nature and are typically excluded by the investment community in preparing its published estimates.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately as it is a better reflection of the ongoing comparable results of the Company, without regard to changes during the period in the market value of the Companys derivative contracts or other typically excluded items.
Adjusted cash flow from operations is a non-GAAP measure that represents cash flow provided by operations before changes in assets and liabilities, as summarized from the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Adjusted cash flow from operations measures the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables or payables.  The Company believes that it is important to consider this measure separately, as it believes it can often be a better way to discuss changes in operating trends in its business caused by changes in production, prices, operating costs and so forth, without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during that period.
