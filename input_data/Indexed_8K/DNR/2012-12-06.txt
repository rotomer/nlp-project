Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 30, 2012, Denbury Onshore, LLC (Denbury Onshore), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. (Denbury or the Company) entered into a Closing Agreement and Amendment dated November 30, 2012 (Closing Agreement) , which amended the Exchange Agreement dated September 19, 2012 (the Exchange Agreement) among Denbury Onshore, Exxon Mobil Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. (collectively, ExxonMobil) in order to provide for the closing of the transaction in two phases.  Pursuant to the Closing Agreement, following the first phase of the closing Denbury retained approximately 17.5% of the interest in its Bakken area assets that otherwise would have been deliverable pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and ExxonMobil retained $350 million of cash consideration that otherwise would have been deliverable pursuant to the Exchange Agreement.  The Closing Agreement further provides for Denbury to acquire, in the second phase closing, in exchange for its retained 17.5% interest in its Bakken area assets, either (i) an interest in ExxonMobils CO reserves in its LaBarge Field in Wyoming, if such property exchange can be agreed upon and consummated or (ii) $350 million in cash, before closing adjustments.  The discussion in Item 2.01 below regarding the Closing Agreement and its effects are incorporated into this Item 1.01.

Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On November 30, 2012, Denbury completed the first phase of its previously announced September 19, 2012 Exchange Agreement with ExxonMobil to sell ExxonMobil the Companys Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for ExxonMobils operating interests in Webster Field in Texas and Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming and $1.6 billion in cash, before closing adjustments (the Exchange Transaction).
In the first of two closings, Denbury received cash of $1.3 billion, after preliminary closing adjustments, plus ExxonMobils operating interests in Webster and Hartzog Draw fields.  This cash amount includes a preliminary closing adjustment of an additional $56 million received by Denbury primarily representing adjustments for net revenues and capital expenditures of the transferred assets from the effective date (July 1, 2012) to the first closing date (November 30, 2012).  Denbury retained approximately 17.5% of its pre-closing interest in its Bakken area assets, and ExxonMobil withheld $350 million of cash consideration provided in the Exchange Agreement to be paid for such Bakken area assets.  At the first closing, Denbury acquired a nearly 100% working interest and nearly 80% net revenue interest in Webster Field in Texas and approximately an 83% working interest and 71% net revenue interest in the oil-producing Shannon Sandstone zone and approximately a 67% working interest and 53% net revenue interest in the natural-gas-producing Big George Coal zone of Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming.  Bakken area assets sold primarily represent Denburys interests in oil and natural gas properties in North Dakota and Montana.
As part of the Closing Agreement referenced in Item 1.01 above, these assets retained by Denbury will be exchanged as part of the second phase closing, which is expected to occur by year end, for either an interest in the CO reserves in ExxonMobils LaBarge Field in Wyoming plus necessary cash adjustments (if an agreement and documentation pursuant to which Denbury would purchase such LaBarge Field CO interest can be agreed upon), or the withheld $350 million in cash, before closing adjustments.

Denbury does not expect to record a gain or loss on the sale of the Bakken area assets in accordance with the full cost method of accounting.  In addition, the Company does not expect to record a reduction in goodwill in conjunction with the sale of the Bakken area assets.
The Company is continuing to seek possible acquisitions in which proceeds from the Exchange Transaction could be utilized in a like-kind exchange transaction to reduce the amount of federal income tax payable due to the transaction.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of the proceeds from the first closing have been placed in qualified trust accounts to fund any such future potential asset purchases.
The attached unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Denbury, adjusted to reflect completion of both phases of the Exchange Transaction with ExxonMobil.  the retained Bakken area assets are sold in the second closing for the withheld $350 million of cash.
Denbury and ExxonMobil are currently negotiating the terms of a potential CO property exchange; however, an agreement on terms for such an exchange has not been finalized or approved.  Accordingly, this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes that

Exhibit 99.1
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Denbury Resources Inc. (Denbury or the Company), adjusted to reflect (i) completion of the asset exchange with Exxon Mobil Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. (collectively, ExxonMobil) which provides for Denbury to sell its Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana to ExxonMobil in exchange for interests in the Webster Field in Texas and Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming, and approximately $1.6 billion of cash, before closing adjustments (the Exchange Transaction), with a July 1, 2012 effective date and (ii) the use of a portion of the Exchange Transaction proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on the Companys bank credit facility, each of which is further described below:
 
 
The summary unaudited pro forma balance sheet data assumes the completion of the Exchange Transaction and the related paydown of the Companys bank credit facility as if each occurred on September 30, 2012.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 give effect to the Exchange Transaction (assuming a Second Phase Cash Closing), paydown of a portion of outstanding borrowings under the Companys bank credit facility and the related tax impacts of these adjustments as if each had occurred on January 1, 2011.  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations exclude the impact of nonrecurring expenses Denbury will incur as a result of the closing of the Exchange Transaction, primarily federal income taxes associated with the income tax gain or loss on sale of our Bakken area assets and transaction costs associated with the Exchange Transaction.  However, these income tax effects and transaction costs are reflected in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations or financial position of Denbury or the pro forma effect of closing of the Exchange Transaction and should not be taken as indicative of Denburys future results of operations or financial position.  Actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and actual results.

Note 1. Basis of Presentation
In September 2012, Denbury entered into an agreement to sell its Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana to ExxonMobil in exchange for (i) $1.6 billion in cash before closing adjustments (including those for post-effective date net revenues), (ii) a nearly 100% working interest and nearly 80% net revenue interest in Webster Field in Texas and (iii) approximately an 83% working interest and 71% net revenue interest in the oil-producing Shannon Sandstone zone and approximately a 67% working interest and 53% net revenue interest in the natural-gas-producing Big George Coal zone of Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming.
Denbury and ExxonMobil closed the first phase of the Exchange Transaction on November 30, 2012, whereby Denbury received cash of approximately $1.3 billion (after preliminary closing adjustments) plus ExxonMobils operating interests in Webster and Hartzog Draw fields in exchange for 82.5% of Denburys interests in its Bakken area assets.  This cash amount includes a preliminary closing adjustment of $56 million received by Denbury primarily representing adjustments for net revenues and capital expenditures of the transferred assets from the effective date (July 1, 2012) to the first closing date (November 30, 2012).  In the second phase of the Exchange Transaction, which is expected to close before December 31, 2012, Denbury will sell its remaining ownership interests in its Bakken area assets in exchange for either i) an interest in the CO reserves in ExxonMobils LaBarge Field in Wyoming, plus necessary cash adjustments or ii) $350 million in cash, before closing adjustments.  The pro forma financial information assumes that Denbury will receive $361 million in cash from ExxonMobil when the second phase of the Exchange Transaction closes, which amount includes Denburys receipt of $11 million in estimated closing adjustments.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at September 30, 2012 has been prepared to give effect to (i) completion of both phases of the Exchange Transaction and (ii) the assumed use of a portion of Exchange Transaction proceeds to pay down the outstanding balance on the Companys bank credit facility as if each occurred on September 30, 2012, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared to give effect to these transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2011.
Note 2. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet
Denburys acquisition of Webster and Hartzog Draw fields constitutes a business combination under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Codifications (FASC) topic.  Accordingly, the purchase price of the acquisition is measured as the fair value of consideration transferred, which consists of the Companys Bakken area assets.  Additionally, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination are recorded at fair value.  The FASC topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred to as the exit price).  The fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the reporting entity. Therefore, entity-specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are consistent with market participant views.
Business Combinations
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
  The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet includes a preliminary estimate of the fair value of the Bakken area net assets transferred and a preliminary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Exchange Agreement.  For purposes of preparing this unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information, all fair value estimates, including fair value estimates of Denburys retained 17.5% ownership in the Bakken area assets to be transferred to ExxonMobil in the second phase closing (expected in December 2012) have been measured as of November 30, 2012, the closing date of the first phase of the Exchange Transaction, using currently available information.  Denbury expects to finalize its valuation of consideration transferred and the allocation of that consideration to assets purchased and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable.

The final valuations and the resulting effect on results of operations and financial position will differ from the pro forma amounts included herein because of, among other reasons:
Changes to the preliminary fair value estimates will impact the value at which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the Companys balance sheet, including the net impact to the Companys full cost pool that will result from the exchange of oil and natural gas properties, and the resulting goodwill.  Changes in estimated fair values will also impact depletion, depreciation and amortization expense on the Companys statement of operations.
The fair value of Bakken area net assets transferred to ExxonMobil in the transaction was measured using a discounted future net cash flow model for developed properties and a market dollar-per-acre value for undeveloped properties.  The fair value of oil and gas properties received from ExxonMobil was measured using a discounted future net cash flow model.  The fair value of oil and natural gas properties is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which the FASC defines as Level 3 inputs.  Key assumptions include observable inputs such as  NYMEX oil and natural gas futures prices and dollar-per-acre values of recent sale transactions in the Bakken area, as well as unobservable inputs regarding the exchange properties such as (1) projections of the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, including those classified as proved, probable and possible, (2) estimated oil and natural gas pricing differentials, (3) projections of future rates of production, (4) timing and amount of future development and operating costs, (5) projected costs of CO (to a market participant), (6) projected reserve recovery factors, and (7) risk-adjusted discount rates.

The consideration to be transferred, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and resulting goodwill were estimated as follows (in thousands):

The November 30, 2012 measurement of the Companys Bakken area assets used in this unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information resulted in the recognition of goodwill of approximately $75.0 million, which represents the excess of the fair value of net assets transferred over the acquisition date estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  This resultant goodwill is due primarily to the valuation of the estimated oil reserves recoverable through a CO enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project.  Denburys access to CO allows the Company to carry out CO EOR activities at a lower cost than other market participants.  However, as discussed above, the FASC topic does not allow entity-specific assumptions in the measurement of fair value.  Therefore, the fair value of oil reserves recoverable through CO EOR have been estimated using the higher cost of CO to other market participants, which lowers the discounted net revenue stream used in making the fair value estimate.
