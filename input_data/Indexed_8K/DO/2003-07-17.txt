EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: LES VAN DYKE JULY 17, 2003 DIRECTOR, INVESTOR RELATIONS (281) 492-5370 DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Houston, Texas, July 17, 2003 -- Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (NYSE:DO) today reported a net loss for the second quarter of 2003 of $16.7 million, or $0.13 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income of $12.0 million, or $0.09 per share on a diluted basis in the same period a year earlier. Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 were $163.2 million, compared with revenues of $187.8 million for the second quarter of 2002. The second quarter results reflect an increase in the estimated asset lives and salvage values of the Company's drilling rigs to better reflect their remaining economic lives. The effect of these changes in accounting estimates was an increase in pre-tax income for the quarter of approximately $6.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The change is expected to increase pre-tax income for the year 2003 by approximately $21.7 million, or $0.14 per share. The Company made this determination by comparing its asset life and salvage value assumptions with its own and industry operating experience and making appropriate adjustments. Diamond Offshore last revised the asset life and salvage value assumptions of its fleet in 1995. Diamond Offshore is a leader in deep water drilling. The Company's fleet of 47 offshore drilling rigs consists of 32 semisubmersibles, 14 jack-ups and one drillship. The fleet operates in the waters of six of the world's seven continents. As previously announced, Diamond Offshore will provide an online, real-time simulcast and rebroadcast of its 2003 second quarter earnings release conference call.
