INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS ------------ On May 2, 2005, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that the Company had entered into a letter of intent ("LOI") with Keppel FELS Limited in Singapore for construction of two high-performance premium jack-up rigs. The units, one to be constructed in Singapore and the other in Brownsville, Texas, are expected to have an aggregate cost of approximately $300 million, including spares, commissioning, site supervision and other costs the Company may incur during the course of construction. Both rigs will be 350-ft. KFELS MOD V B-Class (Super) design, capable of drilling depths of up to 35,000 ft. with a hook load capacity of 2 million pounds and a cantilever reach of 70 ft. Delivery of both units is anticipated in the first quarter of 2008. The LOI also provides an option for construction of a third jack-up rig at a later date. The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive construction contract. Filed herewith is a copy of such press release. Statements in this report that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding construction costs, expected delivery dates, the construction option, execution of definitive construction contracts and market conditions. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements which project, indicate or imply future results and may contain words like "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "estimated" and "budgeted," among others. Such statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. These factors include, among others, the risk that the LOI may not result in a binding contract, potential construction of a rig may not materialize, delays in construction or cost overruns may occur and that the present favorable markets for the Company's services will not be maintained or may not continue to improve, as well as general economic and business conditions, changes in oil and natural gas prices, casualty losses, industry fleet capacity, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, competition, changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations, customer preferences and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report.
