ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT On June 14, 2005, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") issued and sold, in a private placement (the "Private Placement") exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Senior Notes Due July 1, 2015 (the "Notes"). The Notes were sold in the United States only to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act, and subsequently resold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Private Placement resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $247.7 million, which the Company intends to use for general corporate purposes. The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of February 4, 1997, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2005 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee (as so amended and supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). In connection with the Private Placement, the Company entered into the Fifth Supplemental Indenture and an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, dated June 14, 2005 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), with the initial purchaser of the Notes (the "Initial Purchaser"). The Notes bear interest at 4.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning January 1, 2006, and mature on July 1, 2015. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and they rank equal in right of payment to the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, although the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company has the right to redeem all or a portion of the Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15 days but not more that 60 days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes redeemed to the date of redemption. The Indenture contains covenants that limit, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, the Company's ability to: o consolidate with or merge into another entity or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as a whole; o create liens; and o enter into a sale and lease-back transaction covering a drilling rig or drillship. 2
Each of the following is an event of default as defined in the Indenture: o default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the Notes or in payment of any liquidated damages under the Registration Rights Agreement; o default in payment of principal of the Notes at maturity or the redemption price when the same becomes due and payable; o default in the payment (after any applicable grace period) of any indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company in excess of $25.0 million principal amount (excluding such indebtedness of any subsidiary of the Company other than a Significant Subsidiary, as defined in the Indenture, all the indebtedness of which subsidiary is nonrecourse to the Company or any other such subsidiary) or default on such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its express maturity, if such indebtedness is not discharged, or such acceleration is not annulled, by the end of a period of 10 days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes; o default by the Company in the performance of any other covenant contained in the Indenture for the benefit of the Notes that has not been remedied by the end of a period of 60 days after notice is given as specified in the Indenture; and o certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization of the Company or such a significant subsidiary. The Company has agreed, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, to file a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the Notes for debt securities issued by the Company that are substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes. The Company agreed to file such registration statement within 150 days from June 14, 2005 and to use its reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission within 210 days from June 14, 2005. The Company may be required to provide a "shelf" registration statement to cover resales of the Notes under certain circumstances. If the Company fails to file a registration statement, or a registration statement fails to become effective, by the respective deadline set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, or if the required exchange offer is not completed within 45 days after the initial effectiveness of the registration statement for the exchange offer or if, after a registration statement has become effective, it ceases under certain circumstances to be effective or available, then the Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company will be obligated to pay additional interest in the amount of 0.25% per year for the first 90 days and 0.50% per year thereafter as liquidated damages until no such failure remains in effect. 3
The description set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, which are filed as exhibits to this report. This report does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits. 4

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. FIFTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE THIS FIFTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of June 14, 2005, between Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), a banking corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York (the "Trustee"). WITNESSETH WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee an Indenture, dated as of February 4, 1997 (the "Indenture"), providing for the issuance from time to time of its debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called "Securities") in one or more fully registered series; WHEREAS, Section 901(5) of the Indenture provides that the Company and the Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more indentures supplemental thereto to establish the form or terms of Securities of a new series; WHEREAS, Sections 901(2) and 901(7) of the Indenture permit the execution of supplemental indentures without the consent of any Holders to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of, and to add any additional Events of Default with respect to, all or any series of Securities; WHEREAS, Section 301 of the Indenture provides that the Company may enter into supplemental indentures to establish the terms and provisions of a series of Securities issued pursuant to the Indenture; WHEREAS, the Company desires to issue 4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), a new series of Security, the issuance of which was authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, dated June 7, 2005; WHEREAS, the Company, pursuant to the foregoing authority, proposes in and by this Fifth Supplemental Indenture to supplement and amend in certain respects the Indenture insofar as it will apply only to the 2015 Notes (and not to any other series); and WHEREAS, all things necessary have been done to make the 2015 Notes, when executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered hereunder and duly issued by the Company, the valid obligations of the Company, and to make this Fifth Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company, in accordance with their and its terms. 1
NOW THEREFORE: In consideration of the premises provided for herein, the Company and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the 2015 Notes as follows: ARTICLE ONE THE 2015 NOTES Section 101 Designation of 2015 Notes; Establishment of Form. There shall be a series of Securities designated "4.875% Senior Notes due July 1, 2015" of the Company, and the form thereof shall be substantially as set forth in Annex A hereto, which is incorporated into and shall be deemed a part of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by the Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such 2015 Notes, as evidenced by their execution of the 2015 Notes. (a) Restricted Global Securities. All of the 2015 Notes are initially being offered and sold to either (i) qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A (collectively, "QIBs" or individually a "QIB") in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or (ii) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act, and shall be issued initially in the form of one or more Notes in registered, global form without interest coupons, with a restrictive legend as set forth in Annex A hereto (collectively, the "Restricted Global Securities"). The Restricted Global Securities shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the 2015 Notes represented thereby with the Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office, as Securities Custodian for the depositary, The Depository Trust Company (the "DTC") (such depositary, or any successor thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Depositary"), and registered in the name of its nominee, Cede & Co., and, in the case of the 2015 Notes held in accordance with Regulation S, registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominees, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in the DTC (including, if applicable, Euroclear System or Clearstream Banking Luxembourg), duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of a Restricted Global Security may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Securities Custodian as hereinafter provided, subject in each case to compliance with the Applicable Procedures. Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Restricted Global Security may only be held by non-U.S. persons, unless exchanged for interests in the Restricted Global Securities in accordance with transfer and certification requirements. (b) Institutional Accredited Investor Securities. Except as provided in this Section 101 or Section 102, owners of beneficial interests in Global Securities will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Certificated Securities. Securities offered and sold within the United States to institutional accredited investors as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) and 2
(7) under the Securities Act ("Institutional Accredited Investors") shall be issued, initially in the form of Certificated Securities, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. (c) Global Securities in General. Each Global Security shall represent such of the Outstanding 2015 Notes as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding 2015 Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding 2015 Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges or redemptions of such 2015 Notes. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount of any increase or decrease in the principal amount of Outstanding 2015 Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Securities Custodian in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Securities Custodian. Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary (including, for this purpose, its nominee) may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall (A) prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or (B) impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any 2015 Notes. (d) Certificated Securities. Certificated Securities shall be issued only under the limited circumstances provided in Section 101(b), 102(a)(1) and 102(b) hereof. (e) Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where 2015 Notes may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with a Paying Agent. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 607. The Company or any Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them may act as Paying Agent. The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Paying Agent in connection with the 2015 Notes. Section 102 Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities. (1) Except as provided in Section 102(b), Certificated Securities shall be issued in exchange for interests in the Global Securities only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global 3
Securities or if it at any time ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act if so required by applicable law or regulation and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (y) the Company at any time and in its sole discretion determines not to have the 2015 Notes represented by a Global Security, or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. In each case, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order (which the Company agrees to deliver promptly), authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities in exchange therefor. Only Restricted Certificated Securities shall be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Restricted Global Securities, and only Unrestricted Certificated Securities shall be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Unrestricted Global Securities. Certificated Securities issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities shall be registered in such names and shall be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered such Certificated Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. Such exchange shall be effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. Nothing herein shall require the Trustee to communicate directly with beneficial owners, and the Trustee shall in connection with any transfers hereunder be entitled to rely on instructions received through the registered Holder. In the event that Certificated Securities are issued in exchange for beneficial interests in Global Securities in accordance with the foregoing paragraph and, thereafter, the events or conditions specified in this Section 102(a)(1) which required such exchange shall have ceased to exist, the Company shall mail notice to the Trustee and to the Holders stating that Holders may exchange Certificated Securities for interests in Global Securities by complying with the procedures set forth in this Indenture and briefly describing such procedures and the events or circumstances requiring that such notice be given. (2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture other than the provisions set forth in Section 102(a)(1) hereof, a Global Security may not be transferred, except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. Nothing in this Section 102(a)(2) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 102. 4
(b) Restrictions on Transfer of a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security for a Certificated Security. A beneficial interest in a Global Security may not be exchanged for a Certificated Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a request in the form satisfactory to the Trustee from the Depositary or its nominee on behalf of a person having a beneficial interest in a Global Security to register the transfer of all or a portion of such beneficial interest in accordance with Applicable Procedures for a Certificated Security, together with: (1) in the case of a request to register the transfer of a beneficial interest in a Restricted Global Security, a certificate (a "Transfer Certificate"), in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B-1, and a certification in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B-2, that such beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security is being transferred to an Institutional Accredited Investor; (2) written instructions to the Trustee to make, or direct the Security Registrar to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect a decrease in the aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such decrease; and (3) if the Company or the Trustee so requests, a customary opinion of counsel, certificates and other information reasonably acceptable to them as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend described in Section 102(f)(1), then the Trustee shall cause, or direct the Security Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Security Registrar, the aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes represented by the Global Security to be decreased by the aggregate principal amount of the Certificated Security to be issued, shall authenticate and deliver such Certificated Security and shall debit or cause to be debited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Security so issued. (c) Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities. When Certificated Securities are presented by a Holder to a Security Registrar with a request: (1) to register the transfer of the Certificated Securities to a person who will take delivery thereof in the form of Certificated Securities only; or (2) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount of Certificated Securities of other authorized denominations, 5
such Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities presented or surrendered for register of transfer or exchange: (1) shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in accordance with the fifth paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture; and (2) in the case of a Restricted Certificated Security, such request shall be accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (A) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being delivered to the Security Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, or such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate); (B) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred to a person the Holder reasonably believes is a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate); (C) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred to an Institutional Accredited Investor, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate), a certification from the Institutional Accredited Investor to whom such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B-2, and, if the Company or such Security Registrar so requests, a customary opinion of counsel, certificates and other information reasonably acceptable to them as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend described in Section 102(f)(1); or (D) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred (i) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144 or (ii) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (other than pursuant to Rule 144A or Rule 144) and as a result of which, in the case of a Security transferred pursuant to this clause (ii), such Security shall cease to be a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144, a certification to that effect from the Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate) and, if the Company or such Security Registrar so requests, a customary opinion of counsel, certificates and other information reasonably acceptable to the Company and such Security Registrar to the effect that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act. (d) Transfer of a Beneficial Interest in a Restricted Global Security for a Beneficial Interest in an Unrestricted Global Security. Any person having a beneficial interest in 6
a Restricted Global Security may upon request, subject to the Applicable Procedures, transfer such beneficial interest to a person who is required or permitted to take delivery thereof in the form of an Unrestricted Global Security. Upon receipt by the Trustee of written instructions or such other form of instructions as is customary for the Depositary, from the Depositary or its nominee on behalf of any person having a beneficial interest in a Restricted Global Security and the following additional information and documents in such form as is customary for the Depositary from the Depositary or its nominee on behalf of the person having such beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security (all of which may be submitted by facsimile or electronically): (1) if such beneficial interest is being transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from the transferor (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate); or (2) if such beneficial interest is being transferred (i) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144 or (ii) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (other than pursuant to Rule 144A or Rule 144) and as a result of which, in the case of a Security transferred pursuant to this clause (ii), such Security shall cease to be a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144, a certification to that effect from the transferor (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate) and, if the Company or the Trustee so requests, a customary opinion of counsel, certificates and other information reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Trustee to the effect that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act, the Trustee, as a Security Registrar and Securities Custodian, shall reduce or cause to be reduced the aggregate principal amount of the Restricted Global Security by the appropriate principal amount and shall increase or cause to be increased the aggregate principal amount of the Unrestricted Global Security by a like principal amount. Such transfer shall otherwise be effected in accordance with the Applicable Procedures. If no Unrestricted Global Security is then outstanding, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Company Order (which the Company agrees to deliver promptly), authenticate and deliver an Unrestricted Global Security. (e) Transfers of Certificated Securities for Beneficial Interest in Global Securities. If Certificated Securities are presented by a Holder to a Security Registrar with a request: (1) to register the transfer of such Certificated Securities to a person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Security, which request shall specify whether such Global Security will be a Restricted Global Security or an Unrestricted Global Security; or (2) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount of beneficial interests in a Global Security, which beneficial interests will be owned by 7
the Holder transferring such Certificated Securities (provided that in the case of such an exchange, Restricted Certificated Securities may be exchanged only for Restricted Global Securities and Unrestricted Certificated Securities may be exchanged only for Unrestricted Global Securities), the Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested by canceling such Certificated Security and causing, or directing the Securities Custodian to cause, the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Global Security to be increased accordingly and, if no such Global Security is then outstanding, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Global Security; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange: (3) shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in accordance with the fifth paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture; (4) in the case of a Restricted Certificated Security to be transferred for a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Security, such request shall be accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (A) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate); or (B) if such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred pursuant to (i) an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in accordance with Rule 144 or (ii) pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (other than pursuant to Rule 144A or Rule 144) and as a result of which, in the case of a Security transferred pursuant to this clause (ii), such Security shall cease to be a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144, a certification to that effect from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate), and, if the Company or the Security Registrar so requests, a customary opinion of counsel, certificates and other information reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Trustee to the effect that such transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act; (5) in the case of a Restricted Certificated Security to be transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Restricted Global Security, such request shall be accompanied by a certification from such Holder (in substantially the form set forth in the Transfer Certificate) to the effect that such Restricted Certificated Security is being transferred to a person the Holder reasonably believes is a QIB (which, in the case of an exchange, shall be such Holder) in accordance with Rule 144A; and (6) in the case of an Unrestricted Certificated Security to be transferred or exchanged for a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Security, such request need not be accompanied by any additional information or documents. 8
(f) Legends. (1) Except as permitted by the following paragraphs (2) and (3), each Global Security and Certificated Security (and all Securities issued in exchange therefor or upon registration of transfer or replacement thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the form called for by footnote 2 to Annex A hereto (each a "Transfer Restricted Security" for so long as such Security is required by this Indenture to bear such legend). Each Transfer Restricted Security shall have attached thereto a Transfer Certificate in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B-1 hereto. (2) Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer Restricted Security (x) pursuant to Rule 144, (y) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (z) pursuant to any other available exemption (other than Rule 144A) from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and as a result of which, in the case of a Security transferred pursuant to this clause (z), such Security shall cease to be a "restricted security" within the meaning of Rule 144: (A) in the case of any Restricted Certificated Security, any Security Registrar shall permit the Holder thereof to exchange such Restricted Certificated Security for an Unrestricted Certificated Security, or (under the circumstances described in Section 102(e) hereof) to transfer such Restricted Certificated Security to a transferee who shall take such Security in the form of a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Security, and in each case shall rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Security; provided, however, that the Holder of such Restricted Certificated Security shall, in connection with such exchange or transfer, comply with the other applicable provisions of this Section 102; and (B) in the case of any beneficial interest in a Restricted Global Security, the Trustee shall permit the beneficial owner thereof to transfer such beneficial interest to a transferee who shall take such interest in the form of a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Security and shall rescind any restriction on transfer of such beneficial interest; provided, however, that such Unrestricted Global Security shall continue to be subject to the provisions of Section 102(a)(2) hereof, and provided further, however, that the owner of such beneficial interest shall, in connection with such transfer, comply with the other applicable provisions of this Section 102. (3) Upon the exchange, registration of transfer or replacement of Securities not bearing the legend described in paragraph (1) above, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities that do not bear such legend and which do not have a Transfer Certificate attached thereto.

Registration Under the Securities Act. (a) Except as set forth in Section 2(b) below, the Company agrees to file under the Securities Act no later than 150 days after the Closing Date, a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange (such registration statement, the "Exchange Registration Statement", and such offer, the "Exchange Offer") any and all of the Securities for a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities issued by the Company, which debt securities are substantially identical in all material respects to the Securities (and are entitled to the benefits of a trust indenture which is substantially identical in all material respects to the Indenture or is the Indenture and which has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), except that they have been registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and do not contain provisions for the additional interest contemplated in Section 2(c) below (such new debt securities hereinafter called "Exchange Securities"). The Company agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act no later than 210 days after the Closing Date. The Exchange Offer will be registered under the Securities Act on the 3
appropriate form and will comply with all applicable tender offer rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. The Company further agrees, unless the Exchange Offer would not be permitted by applicable law or Commission policy, to use its reasonable best efforts to commence and complete the Exchange Offer promptly, but no later than 45 days after such registration statement has become effective, hold the Exchange Offer open for at least 30 days and exchange Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn on or prior to the expiration of the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer will be deemed to have been "completed" only if the debt securities received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and without material restrictions under the blue sky or securities laws of a substantial majority of the States of the United States of America. The Exchange Offer shall be deemed to have been completed upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Company having exchanged the Exchange Securities for all outstanding Registrable Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer and (ii) the Company having exchanged, pursuant to the Exchange Offer, Exchange Securities for all Registrable Securities that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the Exchange Offer, which shall be on a date that is at least 30 days following the commencement of the Exchange Offer. The Company agrees (x) to include in the Exchange Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is a broker-dealer and (y) to keep such Exchange Registration Statement effective for a period (the "Resale Period") beginning when Exchange Securities are first issued in the Exchange Offer and ending upon the earlier of the expiration of the 180th day after the Exchange Offer has been completed or such time as such broker-dealers no longer own any Registrable Securities. With respect to such Exchange Registration Statement, such holders shall have the benefit of the rights of indemnification and contribution set forth in Sections 6(a), (c), (d) and (e) hereof. (b) If (i) on or prior to the time the Exchange Offer is completed existing Commission interpretations are changed such that the debt securities received by holders other than Restricted Holders in the Exchange Offer for Registrable Securities are not or would not be, upon receipt, transferable by each such holder without restriction under the Securities Act, (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 255 days following the Closing Date or (iii) a holder of the Securities notifies the Company in writing, prior to the 20th day following the time the Exchange Offer is completed, that the Exchange Offer is not available to such holder of the Securities, the Company shall, in lieu of (or, in the case of clause (iii), in addition to) conducting the Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 2(a), file under the Securities Act as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days after the time such obligation to file arises, a "shelf" registration statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous or delayed basis by the holders of, all of the Registrable Securities, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission (such filing, the "Shelf Registration" and such registration statement, the "Shelf Registration Statement"). The Company agrees to use its reasonable efforts (x) to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective no later than 120 days after such Shelf Registration Statement is filed and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective for a period ending on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective Time or such time as there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding, provided, however, that no holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such holder is an Electing Holder and has provided the Company the information required by applicable law to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such Electing Holder, and (y) after the Effective Time of the Shelf 4
Registration Statement, promptly upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that is not then an Electing Holder, to take any action reasonably necessary to enable such holder to use the prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, any action necessary to identify such holder as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement, provided, however, that nothing in this Clause (y) shall relieve any such holder of the obligation to return a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire to the Company in accordance with Section 3(d) (ii) or 3(d)(iii) hereof, as applicable, and to provide the Company with all information required by applicable law to be included in the Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such holder. The Company further agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, as and when required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration, and the Company agrees to furnish to each Electing Holder copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or promptly following its filing with the Commission. (c) In the event that (i) the Company has not filed the Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement on or before the date on which such registration statement is required to be filed pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (ii) such Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement has not become effective or been declared effective by the Commission on or before the date on which such registration statement is required to become or be declared effective pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b), respectively, or (iii) the Exchange Offer has not been completed within 45 days after the initial effective date of the Exchange Registration Statement relating to the Exchange Offer (if the Exchange Offer is then required to be made), or (iv) any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(a) or 2(b) hereof is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter either be withdrawn by the Company or shall become subject to an effective stop order issued pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement (except as specifically permitted herein) without being succeeded promptly by an additional registration statement filed and declared effective, or (v) any Shelf Registration Statement required by Section 2(b) hereof is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter be suspended by the Company pursuant to Section 3(h) hereof (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (v), a "Registration Default" and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a "Registration Default Period"), then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, subject to the provisions of Section 9(b), special interest ("Special Interest"), in addition to the Base Interest, shall accrue at a per annum rate of 0.25% for the first 90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate 0.50% thereafter for the remaining portion of the Registration Default Period. In no event shall Special Interest in respect of a Registration Default exceed a per annum rate of 0.50%. (d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable to be taken by it to ensure that the transactions contemplated herein are effected as so contemplated. (e) Any reference herein to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time and any reference herein to any post-effective amendment to a registration statement as of any time shall be deemed to include any document incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, therein by reference as of such time. 5

("NASD") or any successor thereto, as amended from time to time) thereof, whether as a holder of such Registrable Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Conduct Rules, including by (A) if such Conduct Rules shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in such Conduct Rules) to participate in the preparation of the Shelf Registration Statement relating to such Registrable Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Shelf Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Registrable Securities, (B) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 6 hereof (or to such other customary extent as may be requested by such underwriter), and (C) providing such information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the Conduct Rules; and (xx) comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally available to its securityholders as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement, an earning statement of the Company and its subsidiaries 13

(e) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) above, to notify the Electing Holders, the placement or sales agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof, the Company shall without delay prepare and furnish to each of the Electing Holders, to each placement or sales agent, if any, and to each such underwriter, if any, a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall conform in all material respects to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. Each Electing Holder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) hereof, such Electing Holder shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement applicable to such Registrable Securities until such Electing Holder shall have received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus, and if so directed by the Company, such Electing Holder shall deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Electing Holder's possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. (f) In the event of a Shelf Registration, in addition to the information required to be provided by each Electing Holder in its Notice and Questionnaire, the Company may require such Electing Holder to furnish to the Company such additional information regarding such Electing Holder and such Electing Holder's intended method of distribution of Registrable Securities as may be required in order to comply with the Securities Act. Each such Electing Holder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Electing Holder to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in either case as a result of which any prospectus relating to such Shelf Registration contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities or omits to state any material fact regarding such Electing Holder or such Electing Holder's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Electing Holder or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. (g) Until the expiration of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 144) to, resell any of the Securities that have been reacquired by any of them except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. (h) Upon the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development that, in the reasonable discretion of the Company, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus, the Company shall give written notice to the Electing Holders that the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement is suspended (a "Deferral Notice") and, upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, each Electing 14
Holder agrees to immediately suspend the use of any prospectus and not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement until it is advised in writing by the Company that the prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such prospectus. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the use of the prospectus may be resumed as soon as, in the sole discretion of the Company, such suspension is no longer appropriate. 4. Registration Expenses. The Company agrees to bear and to pay or cause to be paid promptly all expenses incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, including (a) all Commission and any NASD registration, filing and review fees and expenses including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the placement or sales agent or underwriters in connection with such registration, filing and review, (b) all fees and expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under the State securities and blue sky laws referred to in Section 3(d)(xii) hereof and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as any managing underwriters or the Electing Holders may designate, including any reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Electing Holders or underwriters in connection with such qualification and determination, (c) all expenses relating to the preparation, printing, production, distribution and reproduction of each registration statement required to be filed hereunder, each prospectus included therein or prepared for distribution pursuant hereto, each amendment or supplement to the foregoing, the expenses of preparing the Securities for delivery and the expenses of printing or producing any underwriting agreements, agreements among underwriters, selling agreements and blue sky or legal investment memoranda and all other documents in connection with the offering, sale or delivery of Securities to be disposed of (including certificates representing the Securities), (d) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses relating to the offering, sale or delivery of Securities and the preparation of documents referred in clause (c) above, (e) fees and expenses of the Trustee under the Indenture, any agent of the Trustee and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Trustee and of any collateral agent or custodian, (f) internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of the Company's officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), (g) reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel and independent certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any opinions or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance), (h) fees, disbursements and expenses of any "qualified independent underwriter" engaged pursuant to Section 3(d)(xix) hereof, and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel thereto permitted by the terms of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, (i) reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of one counsel for the Electing Holders retained in connection with a Shelf Registration, as selected by the Electing Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities held by Electing Holders (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company), (j) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities, and (k) fees, expenses and disbursements of any other persons, including special experts, retained by the Company in connection with such registration (collectively, the "Registration Expenses"). To the extent that the foregoing Registration Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by any holder of Registrable Securities or any placement or sales agent therefor or underwriter thereof, the Company shall reimburse such person for the full amount of the Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid promptly after receipt of a request therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of the Registrable Securities being registered shall pay all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such Registrable Securities and the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or 15
experts retained by such holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel and experts specifically referred to above. 5. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Purchaser and each of the holders from time to time of Registrable Securities that: (a) Each registration statement covering Registrable Securities and each prospectus (including any preliminary or summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof and any further amendments or supplements to any such registration statement or prospectus, when it becomes effective or is filed with the Commission, as the case may be, and, in the case of an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, at the time of the closing under the underwriting agreement relating thereto, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and at all times subsequent to the Effective Time when a prospectus would be required to be delivered under the Securities Act, other than from (i) such time as a notice has been given to holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3(d)(viii)(F) or Section 3(c)(iii)(F) hereof until (ii) such time as the Company furnishes an amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to Section 3(e) or Section 3(c)(iv) hereof, each such registration statement, and each prospectus (including any summary prospectus) contained therein or furnished pursuant to Section 3(d) or Section 3(c) hereof, as then amended or supplemented, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein. (b) Any documents incorporated by reference in any prospectus referred to in Section 5(a) hereof, when they become or became effective or are or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform or conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and none of such documents will contain or contained an untrue statement of a material fact or will omit or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by a holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use therein. (c) The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is subject (except for such events that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), nor will such action 16
result in any violation of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, as amended, or the by-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities, qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under State securities or blue sky laws in connection with the offering and distribution of the Securities. (d) This Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each of the holders of Registrable Securities included in an Exchange Registration Statement, each of the Electing Holders of Registrable Securities included in a Shelf Registration Statement and each person who participates as a placement or sales agent or as an underwriter in any offering or sale of such Registrable Securities against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such holder, agent or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Exchange Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, as the case may be, under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such holder, Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such holder, such Electing Holder, such agent and such underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any such person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such person expressly for use therein; provided further, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any person in any such case for or in respect of any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising from an offer or sale of Registrable Securities occurring during a period referred to in Section 3(d)(viii)(C) or (F) or Section 3(h), if all Electing Holders received the written notice pursuant to such provision. (b) Indemnification by the Holders and any Agents and Underwriters. As a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof and to entering into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, the Company shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to it from the Electing Holder of such Registrable Securities and from each underwriter named in any such underwriting agreement, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and all other holders of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, 17
damages or liabilities to which the Company or such other holders of Registrable Securities may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein or furnished by the Company to any such Electing Holder, agent or underwriter, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Electing Holder or underwriter expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that no such Electing Holder shall be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 6(b) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Electing Holder from the sale of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. (c) Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of written notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party pursuant to the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by this Section 6, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) Contribution. If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) are unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to 18
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder from the sale of any Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) exceeds the amount of any damages which such holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and no underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The holders' and any underwriters' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and partner of each holder, agent and underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any holder, agent or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the holders and any agents or underwriters contemplated by this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective holder, agent or underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in any registration statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 7. Underwritten Offerings. (a) Selection of Underwriters. If any of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration are to be sold pursuant to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof shall be designated by Electing Holders holding at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities to be included in such offering, provided that such designated managing underwriter or underwriters is or are reasonably acceptable to the Company. 19
(b) Participation by Holders. Each holder of Registrable Securities hereby agrees with each other such holder that no such holder may participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Rule 144. The Company covenants to the holders of Registrable Securities that to the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under Section 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and shall take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or any similar or successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.
