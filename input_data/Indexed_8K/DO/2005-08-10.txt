The press release indicated that maximum total revenue under the LOI for the initial one-year term would be approximately $111 million. The LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement, and actual revenues received could be reduced by various operating factors including utilization rates. Filed herewith is a copy of such press release. Statements in this report that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may include, but are not limited to, statements concerning commitments for drilling work or contracts, future dayrates, future contract revenues, the term and start date of future contracts, entry into definitive agreements, consummation of awarded contracts, satisfaction of conditions precedent, future growth in demand for equipment types or in any region, future cash flows, and future contracts. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements which project, indicate or imply future results and may contain words like "expect," "intend," "plan," "will," "would," "estimated" and "budgeted," among others. Such statements are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. These factors include, among others, the risk that a notification of contract award, letter of intent, or verbal contract commitment may not result in a binding contract, the risk that a binding contract could be terminated, the risk that the markets for the Company's services will not continue to improve, or the risk that factors outside of the Company's control may adversely impact the amount of profit realized from a contract, as well as general economic and business conditions, changes in oil and natural gas prices, casualty losses, industry fleet capacity, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, competition, changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations, customer preferences and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based. A further discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the Company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the Company's reports and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 2
