Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On November 2, 2006, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a five-year, $285 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Houston Agency, Fortis Capital Corp., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank AG, Munich Branch, as co-syndication agents, and the lenders named therein. The credit facility matures on November 2, 2011. The entire amount of the facility is available for loans or the issuance of performance or standby letters of credit. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, the Company has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the credit agreement by up to an additional $100 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings may be made under the facility, at the Company's option, at (i) the alternate base rate, determined as the greater of the prime rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in New York and the sum of the weighted average overnight federal funds rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 50 basis points, or (ii) at the London interbank offered rate plus 27 basis points, based on the Company's current credit ratings. The Company pays, as applicable, based on its current credit ratings, other customary fees including but not limited to a facility fee (8.0 basis points per annum) on the total commitments under the credit facility regardless of usage, a letter of credit fee (9.5 basis points per annum) on the face amount of any performance letter of credit issued, a letter of credit fee (27.0 basis points per annum) on the face amount of any other letter of credit issued, and a utilization fee (5.0 basis points per annum), that applies if borrowings any time equal or exceed 50% of the total commitments under the credit facility. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that the Company pays under the facility.
     The facility contains customary covenants, including but not limited to maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, not to exceed 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter, as well as limitations on liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution; changes in lines of business; swap agreements; transactions with affiliates; and subsidiary indebtedness.
     Borrowings under the facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type and are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that the Company considers usual and customary. On November 3, 2006, no borrowings had been made or letters of credit issued under the facility.
     The credit agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreement.

The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank;
Obligations Absolute
 
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith, an unlawful act or wilful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
          (g) . Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
          (h) . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse or finance such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest
provided
          (i) . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(c). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
Replacement of an Issuing Bank
 
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
          (j) . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing (and the Borrower is not otherwise then required to provide collateral pursuant to Section 5.09), on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and fees; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (i) or (j) of Article VII (unless the Borrower is otherwise then required to provide collateral pursuant to Section 5.09). As collateral security for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, a first priority security interest in such account and all cash and other property from time to time deposited or held in such account, and all proceeds thereof, and any substitutions and replacements therefor. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made, upon the direction of the Borrower, in one or more Permitted Investments, at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse ratably the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
Cash Collateralization

     Section 2.06 .
Funding of Borrowings
          (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement
provided
 
as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Issuing Bank.
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
     Section 2.07 .
Interest Elections
          (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.04 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
               (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
               (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
               (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
               (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
     Section 2.08 .
Termination and Reduction of Commitments
          (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
          (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
provided
          (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to
provided
 
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent and may not be reinstated except pursuant to Section 2.02. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
     Section 2.09 .
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
          (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date.
          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
provided
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form of Exhibit D. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
          (f) With respect to each Lender holding a Note, upon the full and final payment by the Borrower to each Lender (or to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender) of all amounts due under any Note payable to such Lender, and the termination of the Commitment of such Lender, such Lender agrees to return such Note to the Borrower with reasonable promptness.
 
     Section 2.10 .
Prepayment of Loans
          (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
          (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.03. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and any break funding payments to the extent required by Section 2.15.

provided
          (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a utilization fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of such Lender's Loan Exposure solely during the time the sum of the total Loan Exposures equals or exceeds 50% of the total Commitments during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Commitments terminate (and during any time after the date that the Commitments are terminated in which any Loan Exposure shall be outstanding if the sum of the total Loan Exposures shall have equaled to or exceeded 50% of the total
 
Commitments in effect on such date of termination). Accrued utilization fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; that any utilization fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.

Interest
          (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
          (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
     Section 2.13 . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest
          (a) the Administrative Agent determines in good faith (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof and the reason therefor (in reasonable detail) to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
 
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (which the Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts to do promptly after such circumstances cease to exist), (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

Increased Costs
          (a) If any Change in Law shall:
               (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
               (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, which certificate shall
 
describe in reasonable detail an explanation of the basis thereof, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 20 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor and provides a certificate in accordance with Section 2.14(c); further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
provided
     Section 2.15 . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), other than by reason of a default of such Lender, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, pursuant to this Section 2.15, such Lender shall provide to the Borrower a certificate executed by an officer of such Lender setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) no later than ninety (90) days after the event giving rise to the claim for compensation, and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be evidence of such Lender's entitlement thereto. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 20 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, except as a result of the gross negligence, bad faith, unlawful act or willful misconduct of such Lender. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender, Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent shall be indemnified for any Taxes hereunder unless such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall make written demand on the Borrower for reimbursement hereunder no later than 180 days after the earlier of (i) the date on which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent makes payment of the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and (ii) the date on which the relevant taxing authority or other governmental authority makes written demand upon such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent for payment of the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (for purposes of this clause (ii), "written demand" means a written notice that includes the amount of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes). Any such demand shall be in writing and shall describe in reasonable detail any such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes. In the event that such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent fails to give the Borrower timely notice as provided herein, the Borrower shall not have any obligation to pay such claim for reimbursement. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, such Foreign Lender shall timely deliver updated versions of such documentation, as applicable, whenever required by law or the previously submitted documentation becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect. Any Lender that is a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, an accurate and complete original signed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation prescribed by law certifying that such Lender is not subject to back-up withholding.
          (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall promptly pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
     Section 2.17 .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
          (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, Section 2.15 or Section 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without deduction, set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the
 
case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined
 
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d) or (e), Section 2.06(b), Section 2.17(d) or Section 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
     Section 2.18 .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
          (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, (iv) any Lender has been declared insolvent or a receiver or conservator has been appointed for a material portion of its assets, business or properties, (v) any Lender gives notice pursuant to Section 2.19, or (vi) any Lender shall decline to consent to a modification or waiver of the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document requested by the Borrower, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee permitted by Section 9.04 that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (A) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of each Issuing Bank, if a Commitment is being assigned, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (C) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver
provided
 
by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
     Section 2.19 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans either generally or having a particular Interest Period hereunder, then (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and such Lender's obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans (the "") shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain such Eurodollar Loans and (b) all Affected Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender shall be made instead as ABR Loans (and, if such Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, all Affected Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted into ABR Loans either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Affected Loans to such day, or, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Affected Loans, on the date specified by such Lender in such notice) and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or converted into) ABR Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its ABR Loans. Each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would avoid the need for such notice and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

     The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
     The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) and in all cases the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Documents unless it shall (i) receive written instructions from the Required Lenders or the Lenders, as applicable, (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) specifying the action to be taken and (ii) be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expenses which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. If a Default has occurred and is
 
continuing, then the Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the requisite Lenders in the written instructions (with indemnities) described in this Article VIII, that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law. The instructions as aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto by the Administrative Agent shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
provided
     The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
     The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time, and shall resign upon any removal thereof as a Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Any
 
resignation of the Administrative Agent shall not be effective until a replacement therefor is appointed pursuant to the terms hereof. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 and a rating of no less than A- from S&P, with an office in New York, New York. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
     The Arranger and the Co-Syndication Agents shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities under any Loan Document other than their duties, responsibilities and liabilities in their capacity as Lenders (or Issuing Banks, if applicable) hereunder.
     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Waivers; Amendments
          (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
 
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
          (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration or termination of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata treatment of Lenders or the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) alter the manner in which payments or prepayments of principal, interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders or Types of Loans, without the written consent of each Lender, or (vi) change Section 4.01 or any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
provided
                    (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement;

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.
          (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     Prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in October 1995, or the Initial Public Offering, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation, or Loews. In connection with the Initial Public Offering, we entered into agreements with Loews pursuant to which Loews provides certain management, administrative and other services to us and certain other obligations were assumed by the parties. These agreements were not the result of arm's length negotiations between the parties.
     . We entered into a services agreement with Loews effective upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering pursuant to which Loews agreed to continue to perform certain administrative and technical services on our behalf. These services include personnel, telecommunications, purchasing, internal auditing, accounting, data processing and cash management services, in addition to advice and assistance with respect to preparation of tax returns and obtaining insurance. Under the services agreement, we reimburse Loews for (i) allocated personnel costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and payroll taxes) of the Loews personnel actually providing such services and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses related to the provision of such services. The services agreement may be terminated at our option upon 30 days' notice to Loews and at the option of Loews upon six months' notice to us. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Loews for all claims and damages arising from the provision of services by Loews under the services agreement, unless due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Loews. Under the services agreement, we paid Loews approximately $429,000 for services performed by Loews in 2005.
Services Agreement
     . Under a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 16, 1995, as amended, between us and Loews, subject to certain limitations, we will file, upon the request of Loews, one or more registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to a maximum of two remaining requests, in order to permit Loews to offer and sell any of our common stock that Loews may hold. Loews will bear the costs of any such registered offering, including any underwriting commissions relating to shares it sells in any such offering, any related transfer taxes and the costs of complying with non-U.S. securities laws, and any fees and expenses of separate counsel and accountants retained by Loews. We have the right to require Loews to delay any exercise by Loews of its rights to require registration and other actions for a period of up to 90 days if, in our judgment, any offering by us then being conducted or about to be conducted would be adversely affected. In addition, we have the right to require Loews to suspend the use of any resale prospectus or prospectus supplement included in a "shelf" registration statement for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 90 days in any one instance or an aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period, if we are conducting or about to conduct an underwritten public offering of our securities for our own account, or would be required to disclose information regarding our company not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed where such disclosure would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any material business transaction or negotiation in which we are then engaged. Subject to certain conditions, we have also granted Loews the right to include its shares of our common stock in
Registration Rights Agreement
 
any registration statements covering offerings of our common stock by us, and we will pay all costs of such offerings other than underwriting commissions and transfer taxes attributable to the shares sold on behalf of Loews. We will indemnify Loews, and Loews will indemnify us, against certain liabilities in respect of any registration statement or offering covered by the registration rights agreement, as amended.
     . During 2005 we made payments of $1.2 million to Ernst & Young LLP for tax and other consulting services. The wife of Lawrence R. Dickerson, our President and Chief Operating Officer and one of our directors, is an audit partner at this firm.

To the Lenders party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the Lenders
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as counsel to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), in connection with the preparation, authorization, execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2006 (the ""), among the several lenders party thereto (the ""), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the ""), and the Company, as Borrower. Capitalized terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used (but not otherwise defined) herein are used herein as so defined.
Company
Credit Agreement
Lenders
Administrative Agent
          In so acting, we have examined originals or executed copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (a) the Credit Agreement and the Notes issued by the Company on the date hereof (collectively, the "") and (b) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
Loan Documents
          In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied solely upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Loan Documents and have assumed that certificates of public officials dated prior to the date hereof remain accurate as of the date hereof. As used herein, "of which we are aware" means the conscious awareness of facts or other information by any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.
 
          Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
          1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
          2. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by each of the other parties thereto) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and except that (A) rights to indemnification, reimbursement and contribution thereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws or public policy and (B) no opinion is expressed with respect to (i) any set-off provision contained in any Loan Document including, without limitation, Section 9.08 (Setoff) of the Credit Agreement, (ii) provisions that purport to waive rights to notices, objections, demands, legal defenses, statutes of limitation, rights to trial by jury, or other benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law, (iii) provisions that decisions by a party are conclusive and (iv) provisions purporting to establish evidentiary standards for suits or proceedings to enforce a Loan Document.
          3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan Documents and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any agreement listed on hereto, (iii) any Applicable Laws or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which we are aware.
Schedule A
          4. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Delaware corporate or federal governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan Documents, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, except for (i) any consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action or filing required by federal and state securities or blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any maritime law or regulations, as to which we express no opinion, (ii) those required by the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, as to which we express no opinion, and (iii) those already obtained.
          5. The Company is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In rendering the opinion in this paragraph
 
5, we have assumed with your permission that Loews Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is not and is not controlled by an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          The opinions expressed herein are subject in all respects to the following qualifications, assumptions, exceptions, limitations and comments:
     (i) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions in the Loan Documents providing for (a) collection of fees, late charges, default rate interest, interest on interest or other penalties, or reimbursement of court costs and legal fees, (b) the right of any person to declare a default, accelerate obligations of any other person or exercise remedies based on non-material breaches of any of the Loan Documents, (c) any obligation or liability contained therein to survive the repayment of the Loan, (d) the negation or limitation of liabilities, duties and obligations of any Lender, (e) the ability of any party to collect attorneys' fees and costs in an action involving the Company if such party is not the prevailing party in such action or to the extent such fees and costs are greater than such fees and costs as may be determined to be reasonable by a court or other tribunal or (f) the establishment of methods of proof.
     (ii) We assume that each of the parties to the Loan Documents other than the Company will seek to enforce its rights thereunder in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
          For purposes of paragraph 3 of this opinion, "" means those laws and regulations of the State of New York and the United States of America that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Loan Documents; provided, however, that the term "" does not include, and we express no opinion with regard to (i) any state or federal laws, rules or regulations relating to: (A) pollution or protection of the environment; (B) zoning, land use, building or construction; (C) occupational safety and health or other similar matters; (D) labor, employee rights and benefits, including, without limitation, the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; (E) antitrust and trade regulation; (F) tax; (G) securities, including, without limitation, federal and state securities or blue sky laws, rules or regulations; (H) corrupt practices, including, without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended; and (I) copyrights, patents and trademarks, (ii) any maritime laws or regulations, or the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended and (iii) any laws, rules or regulations of any county, municipality or similar political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof.
