Item 5.02.
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(e) On March 30, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") determined the performance goals, participants, payout formulas and maximum awards for the 2007 performance period under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Officers (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2007) (the "Incentive Compensation Plan"). The 2007 awards will be based on the results of the Company's drilling operations, specifically, the percentage of actual EBITDA (as defined by the Compensation Committee) for 2007 compared to the average of 2007 budgeted EBITDA and 2006 actual EBITDA. The amount available for incentive awards to each participant will be a function of the participant's incentive target, which is expressed a percentage of that participant's eligible base salary, and will not exceed the product of that incentive target and the participant's eligible base salary. In accordance with the Incentive Compensation Plan, the Compensation Committee has retained negative discretion to reduce or eliminate any 2007 award payable to any of the participants.
     The table below sets forth the incentive target and maximum award established under the Incentive Compensation Plan for the 2007 performance period for each of the named executive officers identified in the Company's proxy statement for its 2007 annual meeting of stockholders.
