Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(e) At the annual meeting of stockholders of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") held on May 15, 2007, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan for Executive Officers (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2007) (the "Incentive Compensation Plan"). The Incentive Compensation Plan is designed to qualify the amounts paid under its terms to the Company's executive officers as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This qualification will allow amounts awarded under the Incentive Compensation Plan to be deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes, even if, when combined with other compensation, the award causes the compensation of any of the participants to exceed $1 million.
     The principal changes effected by the amendments approved by the stockholders included the following:
     This summary of the amendments to such plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Incentive Compensation Plan which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
