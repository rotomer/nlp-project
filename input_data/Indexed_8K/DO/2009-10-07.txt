Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person, and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) such settlement does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Person and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by

the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
 
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
     (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
     11. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related reasonable fees and

     (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
     12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

     3. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.

The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (in each case other than the financial statements and the notes thereto, the financial statement schedules and other financial and accounting data included therein or which should be included therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
     5. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement. The Securities have

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company. The Indenture has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), except that (A) rights to indemnification and contribution thereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws or public policy relating thereto and (B) no opinion need be expressed with respect to any provision of the Indenture providing for liquidated damages.
     7. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture and this Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and hereunder and the issuance and sale of the Securities pursuant to the Indenture and this Agreement will not conflict with, constitute a breach or default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended, of the Company, (ii) any New York, Texas, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal securities laws, as to which such counsel need express no opinion in this paragraph, and state securities laws or blue sky laws and the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), or (iii) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which such counsel is aware.
     8.

     10. The Company is not an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
     The opinion of Duane Morris LLP described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.

     Such counsel shall confirm to you that, on the basis of the information they gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to their attention which cause them to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Effective Time (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the Effective Time) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the this Agreement), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in each case other than the financial statements and the related notes thereto, the financial statement schedules and the other financial and accounting data included therein or which should be included therein, as to which such counsel need express no view).
 
Annex C
     1. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its activities requires such qualification, except where the failure by the Company to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
     2. Except for directors' qualifying shares, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests, as applicable, of (i) each subsidiary of the Company listed on Schedule 4 hereto (each, a "" and collectively, the "") and (ii) to such counsel's knowledge, Diamond Offshore Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales, Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Islands company, and Diamond Offshore Drilling Limited, a Cayman Islands company, are owned, directly or indirectly, of record and beneficially by the Company (except for directors' qualifying shares), free and clear of all liens, claims, limitations on voting rights, options, security interests and other encumbrances and have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

Subsidiaries
     3. Each Subsidiary is a corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, and is in good standing in the states listed by such Subsidiary's name on the attached Schedule 4 (such states being the only states in which each such Subsidiary is required to be qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
     4. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Indenture and this Agreement and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and hereunder and the issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters hereunder and the compliance by the Company with all the provisions of the Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby will not conflict with, constitute a breach or a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable governing documents of any of the Subsidiaries, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document, agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is subject except any such conflict, breach, default or violation which would not,
 
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (iii) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on any of the Subsidiaries.
     5. To such counsel's knowledge, (A) there are no current or pending legal or governmental proceedings that would be required by the Securities Act to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that are not so described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and (B) there are no statutes, regulations or contracts and other documents that are required under the Securities Act to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and that have not been so filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.

FIRM and AFFILIATE OFFICES
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157865) (the "Registration Statement"), relating to the offer and sale by the Company of various securities from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, and with respect to the issuance of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.70% Senior Notes due October 15, 2039 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to that certain Indenture, dated as of February 4, 1997 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York) (as successor under the Base Indenture to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of October 8, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, as so supplemented and amended, the "Indenture"). Such $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes are being offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the prospectus dated March 11, 2009 contained in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated October 5, 2009 filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on October 6, 2009 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), and pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated October 5, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters identified therein, and the Company.
     In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the Registration Statement, the Base Indenture, the form of Supplemental Indenture, the form of Note set forth in the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or
 
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. October 6, 2009 Page 2
comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
     In such examination, we have assumed all information contained in all documents reviewed by us is true and correct, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to these opinions that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and upon the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Underwriting Agreement. We have also assumed that the Supplemental Indenture and the Notes will be executed and delivered substantially in the form examined by us.
     In rendering this opinion, we have assumed that the Trustee is qualified to act as trustee under the Indenture and that at the time of execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Indenture will be the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee. We have also assumed that (i) at the time of execution, authentication, issuance and delivery of the Notes, the Indenture will have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, (ii) the Notes will have been issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and (iii) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company.
     Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and assumptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, when duly executed by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as contemplated by the Prospectus, and upon payment of the consideration therefor provided for in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
     The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including all applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws) and the federal laws of the United States, and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We express no opinion regarding any federal or state securities laws or regulations.
     We hereby consent to the use of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to any and all references to our firm in the prospectus which is a part of the Registration

Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
Very truly yours,
Duane Morris LLP
