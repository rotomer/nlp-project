     Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") hereby incorporates by reference into this Item 7.01 the summary report of the status, as of August 13, 2010, of the Company's offshore drilling rigs attached as Exhibit 99.1, which is being furnished in accordance with Rule 101(e)(1) under Regulation FD and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated by reference.
     Statements in this report that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the current term, future dayrates, future status, start and end dates and comments concerning future contracts and availability, letters of intent, utilization, surveys, downtime and other aspects of the Company's drilling rigs, as well as statements concerning the moratorium on, or suspension of, certain drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and enhanced safety requirements implemented by the U.S. government, related legal proceedings and outcomes thereof, the impact of these and related events on the Company's operations and revenues, the effects of claims of force majeure and the outcomes of discussions with operators with regard thereto, rigs being upgraded or to be upgraded and the revised contract. Such statements are inherently subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the Company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the Company's reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include, among others, general economic and business conditions, contract cancellations, customer bankruptcy, operating risks, casualty losses, industry fleet capacity, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, competition, changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations, customer preferences and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

RECENT COMMITMENTS  (See Body of Report For Contract Details/Date Changes and Other Information)
. On May 30, 2010, the U.S. government implemented a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in water deeper than 500 feet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and subsequently implemented enhanced safety requirements applicable to all drilling activities in the GOM, including drilling activities in water shallower than 500 feet. On June 22, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted a temporary injunction which immediately prohibited enforcement of the moratorium. The government appealed District Court's decision and requested that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stay the injunction pending appeal. The Fifth Circuit denied the government's stay motion. While the appeal is pending, the government has rescinded the moratorium and ordered a new suspension through November 30, 2010, subject to modifications by the government under certain circumstances, of drilling activities using subsea blowout preventers (BOPs) or surface BOPs on floating facilities. Further proceedings with respect to the moratorium and the new suspension are pending. We currently have six rigs under contract in the GOM, three of which use subsea BOPs. We are not able to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings, whether enforcement of the moratorium will be permanently enjoined, whether the suspension will remain in place, or whether the government will seek to implement additional restrictions on or prohibitions of drilling activities in the GOM; and we are not able to predict the impact of these events on our operations. Our customers may seek to move rigs to locations outside of the GOM, perform activities permitted under the moratorium and the enhanced safety requirements, or attempt to terminate our contracts pursuant to their respective force majeure provisions. If an actual force majeure event occurs, as determined under the applicable contract, these agreements generally provide for a force majeure rate that extends for a specified period of time and varies from contract to contract. Several customers have either declared force majeure or indicated that they may declare force majeure under their relevant contracts. We are working closely with our customers to assess each situation.
Note (1)
 In regard solely to the ATP contract, for a minimum of the first 240 days of the initial one-year contract period, Contract Drilling Revenue is to be recognized under normal GAAP accrual accounting at $540,000 per day, and additional contract dayrate of $20,000 is to be recognized as interest income over applicable periods reflecting deferred payment plan. The contract calls for $75,000 per day of the $560,000 contract dayrate to be paid on a current basis and the remaining $485,000 per day to be paid pursuant to an overriding royalty interest structure, as discussed in the Company's Form 8-K that was filed on June 3, 2009. Remaining days under the initial one-year contract period will be deferred until approximately the fourth quarter of 2011, when the contract provides that the rig will be utilized by the operator at a dayrate of $540,000 payable in cash.
Note (2). Victory
 We received notice from the operator claiming force majeure on the grounds that the moratorium implemented by the U.S. government and the regulations related to increased safety and information requirements prevents them from conducting operations under the drilling contract. We do not believe the events claimed by the operator come within the definition of force majeure under the drilling contract.

 On June 15, 2010, we entered into a contract amendment which provides for a special permit standby rate of zero dollars ($0) during periods when the operator is unable to continue operations while waiting on certain regulatory permits.

 In connection with the relocation of this rig out of the GOM pursuant to this contract, the previous operator paid an early termination fee of $31 million in order to satisfy certain contractual obligations.
Note (5). Endeavor
 Dayrate subject to certain potential adjustments that are not expected to be material.

NOTES: Rig utilization rates can be adversely impacted by additional downtime due to unscheduled repairs and maintenance, weather conditions and other factors.
An LOI is subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement and as such may not result in a binding contract.
Options are un-priced and any extension of contract is subject to mutually agreeable terms & conditions unless otherwise indicated.
Mobe revenues (if any) and mobe expenses are deferred, and generally are amortized over the life of the contract. GOM = Gulf of Mexico.
*Nominal water depth (in feet) reflects the current operating water depth capability for each drilling unit. In many cases, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in greater water depths. In all cases, floating rigs are capable of working successfully at greater depths than their nominal depth. On a case by case basis, we may achieve a greater depth capacity by providing additional equipment.
Nominal Water Depth 
On rig utilization, assume 95% for DP units, 96% for conventionally moored rigs, and 98% for jack-ups.

Survey Costs: During surveys, normal opex applies, plus additional costs.
Mobe Costs: Amortized mobe costs are generally offset by amortized mobe revenues.
