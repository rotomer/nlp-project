Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") hereby incorporates by reference into this Item 7.01 the summary report of the status, as of November 16, 2011, of the Company's offshore drilling rigs attached as Exhibit 99.1, which is being furnished in accordance with Rule 101(e)(1) under Regulation FD and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated by reference.
Statements in this report that contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the current term, future dayrates, future status, start and end dates and comments concerning future contracts and availability, letters of intent, utilization, surveys, downtime and other aspects of the Company's drilling rigs, as well as any statements concerning legal proceedings and outcomes thereof, the impact of these and related events on the Company's operations and revenues, the effects of claims of force majeure and the outcomes of discussions with operators with regard thereto, rigs being upgraded or to be upgraded, rigs under construction and the revised contract. Such statements are inherently subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the Company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the Company's reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include, among others, general economic and business conditions, contract cancellations, customer bankruptcy, operating risks, casualty losses, industry fleet capacity, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, competition, changes in foreign, political, social and economic conditions, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations, customer preferences and various other matters, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the rig status report, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

NOTES
In regard solely to the ATP contract, for a minimum of the first 240 days and potentially for all of the initial one-year contract period, Contract Drilling Revenue is to be recognized under normal GAAP accrual accounting at $540,000 per day, and additional contract dayrate of $20,000 is to be recognized as interest income over applicable periods reflecting deferred payment plan. The contract calls for $75,000 per day of the $560,000 contract dayrate to be paid on a current basis and the remaining $485,000 per day to be paid pursuant to an overriding royalty interest structure, as discussed in the Company's Form 8-K that was filed on June 3, 2009. The contract may be extended beyond the initial one-year contract period for such days as are necessary to complete the drilling of a well then in progress, and the dayrate for such days, if any, will be $540,000 payable in cash.
Note 1.) Ocean Victory 
reflects the rig's current operating water depth capability. Often, rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in greater water depths. In all cases, floating rigs are capable of working successfully at greater depths than their nominal depth. On a case by case basis, we may achieve a greater depth capacity by providing additional equipment.
Note 2.)
Nominal water depth
 
reflects currently planned downtime. Expect additional downtime in the form of possible mobes for new jobs not yet contracted, possible acceptance testing at new jobs, and unanticipated maintenance. Survey start times may also be accelerated or delayed for various reasons.
Note 3.) Expected downtime
General Notes
Assume rates of 95% for DP units, 96% for conventionally moored rigs, and 98% for jack-ups. Rig utilization rates can be adversely impacted by additional downtime due to unscheduled repairs and maintenance, and other factors.
Average Utilization Rates
are unpriced and any extension of a contract is subject to mutually agreeable terms and conditions unless otherwise indicated.
Options
All Dayrates Exclude Mobe.
Mobe revenues (if any) and mobe expenses are deferred, and generally are amortized over the life of the contract.
Mobe costs are amortized mobe costs and are generally offset by amortized mobe revenues.
During surveys, normal operating expense will be incurred, plus additional costs.
