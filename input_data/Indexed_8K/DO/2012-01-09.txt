"We think significant opportunity remains for new deepwater units," said Larry Dickerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Diamond Offshore. "No new capacity targeting the standard midwater and deepwater markets is currently under construction, and this rig should be ideally suited to meet emerging demand in this segment. When added to our three ultra-deepwater drillships under construction, this unit will continue the process of renewing Diamond's fleet."
"We will construct the utilizing an existing hull from a Diamond Offshore cold stacked unit, which previously operated as the Ocean Voyager. This should allow the to be built and placed into service in approximately half the time and at half the cost of current newbuilds."
