On September 28, 2012, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and swingline lender, the issuing banks named therein and the lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on September 28, 2017. The entire amount of the facility is available for revolving loans. Up to $250 million of the facility is available for the issuance of performance or other standby letters of credit and up to $75 million is available for swingline loans.
Letters of credit may be issued under the Credit Agreement in U.S. dollars or in certain alternative currencies. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the Credit Agreement, the Company has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $250 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders.
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at (a) the Alternate Base Rate (as described below) plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25%, as determined based on the Company's credit ratings, or (b) the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.75% to 1.25%, as determined based on the Company's credit ratings.

In addition, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the Company must cash collateralize part or all of the lenders' credit exposures under the Credit Agreement if the Company fails to obtain certain credit ratings as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Certain cash collateral may also be required in connection with defaulting lenders or as a result of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement).

(ii) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Letter of Credit is denominated in a Foreign Currency, such amount shall be, with respect to such Foreign Currency L/C, the relevant Foreign Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Foreign Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

provided
(e) . The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of:
Obligations Absolute

(ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(iv) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Letter of Credit Documents;

(vi) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, an unlawful act or willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
Liability
provided
(g) . Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by facsimile or, unless otherwise required by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower prior to such delivery, electronic mail (PDF)) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
(h) . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse or finance such LC Disbursement when due

Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(i) . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

As collateral security for the payment and performance of the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lender Parties, a first priority security interest in the Cash Collateral Account and all cash and other property from time to time deposited or held in such account, and all proceeds thereof, and any substitutions and replacements therefor. If at any time Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Lender Parties as herein provided, or the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the amount required to be deposited under this Agreement, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by any Defaulting Lender).
Establishment of Cash Collateral Account
(ii) . Moneys in such account (other than moneys required to be deposited pursuant to Section 5.09) shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse ratably the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
Application of Funds
 
of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated in accordance with Article VII, any and all collateral held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.09 may be applied by the Administrative Agent to satisfy the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.
(iii) . If (A) with respect to Cash Collateral deposited by the Borrower pursuant to any provision of this Agreement other than Section 5.09, no Default has occurred and is continuing, or (B) with respect to Cash Collateral deposited by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.09, at any time any amount of Cash Collateral deposited by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.09 exceeds the amount from time to time expressly required to be deposited pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of such Section 5.09, then, in each case, from time to time, within three Business Days of the Borrower's written request, the Administrative Agent shall release to the Borrower any and all funds held in the Cash Collateral Account above the aggregate amounts then expressly required, if any, to be deposited and held as Cash Collateral under all relevant provisions of this Agreement.
Release of Funds
(iv) . The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Cash Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made, upon the direction of the Borrower, in one or more Permitted Investments, at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. The Administrative Agent shall exercise reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account and shall be deemed to have exercised such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any such funds.
Administration of Cash Collateral Account
(k) . At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within two Business Days following receipt of the written request from the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall deposit into the Cash Collateral Account an amount not less than 102% of such Issuing Bank's Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender if, and to the extent, required by Section 2.21(a)(v).
Defaulting Lender
(i) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided by the Borrower under this Section 2.05(k) or by the Borrower or a Defaulting Lender under Section 2.21 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender's obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Exposure (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
Application
 
(ii) . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Bank's Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.05(k) or Section 2.21 following (A) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (B) the determination by the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank, acting reasonably, that there exists Cash Collateral in excess of the amount required to be maintained pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; that, subject to Section 2.21, the Person providing Cash Collateral and such Issuing Bank may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other Obligations.
Termination of Requirement
provided
Section 2.06 .
Funding of Revolving Borrowings
(a) Each Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Revolving Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(d) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Issuing Bank.
provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made its Applicable Percentage of such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
Section 2.07 .
Interest Elections; Conversions and Continuations
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Revolving Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Revolving Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Revolving Borrowing, and the Revolving Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing.
 
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.04 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, facsimile or, unless otherwise required by the Administrative Agent prior to such delivery, electronic mail (PDF) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
(i) the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Revolving Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Revolving Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
Section 2.08 .
Termination and Reduction of Commitments
(a) . Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
General
(b) .
Optional
(i) The Borrower may at any time terminate in whole, or from time to time reduce in part the unused portion of the Aggregate Commitment; that (A) each partial reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (B) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitment if, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Credit Exposures would exceed the Aggregate Commitment.
provided
(ii) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate in whole or reduce the Aggregate Commitment under this paragraph (b) at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination in whole of the Aggregate Commitment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be permanent and may not be reinstated except pursuant to Section 2.02. Each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
(c) . At any time when a Lender is then a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower, at the Borrower's election, may elect to reduce or terminate such Defaulting Lender's Commitment hereunder; provided that (i) the Borrower must elect to either terminate such Defaulting Lender's entire Commitment or terminate such Defaulting Lender's entire unused Commitment, (ii) if the Borrower elects to terminate such Defaulting Lender's entire Commitment, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent all amounts owed by the Borrower in respect of such terminated Commitment amount to such Defaulting Lender in its capacity as a Lender under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents and shall, to the extent such Defaulting Lender's ratable share of the LC Exposure has not been, or has only partially been, reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21, deposit into the Cash Collateral Account Cash Collateral in the amount equal to 102% of the Fronting Exposure attributable to such Defaulting Lender, and (iii) such termination shall not be permitted if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Upon written notice to the Defaulting Lender and the Administrative Agent of the Borrower's election to terminate such Defaulting Lender's entire Commitment pursuant to this clause (c) and the payment and deposit of amounts (if any) required to be made by the Borrower under clause (ii) above, (A) such Defaulting Lender shall cease to be a "Lender" hereunder for all purposes except that such Lender's rights and obligations as a Lender under Sections 2.15, 2.17, 8.06 and 9.03 shall continue with respect to events and occurrences
Defaulting Lender
 
occurring before or concurrently with its ceasing to be a "Lender" hereunder, (B) such Defaulting Lender's Commitment shall be deemed terminated in whole and (C) such Defaulting Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder as a "Lender" except pursuant to surviving obligations (including Sections 2.17 and 9.12 and as to its indemnification obligations under Article 8 with respect to events and occurrences occurring before or concurrently with its ceasing to be a "Lender" hereunder), provided that any such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Lender against such Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.09 .
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
(a) . The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of (i) each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) each Swingline Loan on the Swingline Payment Date applicable to such Swingline Loan.
Repayment
(b) . Each Lender and the Swingline Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender or the Swingline Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender or Swingline Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender or Swingline Lender from time to time hereunder.
Maintenance of Accounts by Lenders and Swingline Lender
(c) . The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
Maintenance of Accounts by Administrative Agent
(d) . The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender, the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Prime Facie Evidence
provided
(e) . Any Lender may request that Revolving Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form of Exhibit D. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Revolving Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more Revolving Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
Revolving Notes
 
(f) . The Swingline Lender may request that Swingline Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Swingline Lender a Swingline Note payable to the order of the Swingline Lender and in substantially the form of Exhibit E.

Return of Notes
Section 2.10 .
Swingline Loans
(a) . On the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and if an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, subject to the terms and conditions of such AutoBorrow Agreement, the Swingline Lender shall, from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period, make Swingline Loans to the Borrower which shall be due and payable on the Swingline Payment Date, notwithstanding the fact that such Swingline Loans, when aggregated with the Credit Exposure of the Swingline Lender in its capacity as a Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender's Commitment; provided that (i) after giving effect to such Swingline Loan, (A) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans shall not exceed the Swingline Sublimit Amount in effect at such time and (B) the aggregate Credit Exposures of all Lenders shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment in effect at such time; (ii) no Swingline Loan shall be made by the Swingline Lender if the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 have not been met as of the date of such Swingline Loan, it being agreed by the Borrower that the giving of the applicable Notice of Borrowing and the acceptance by the Borrower of the proceeds of such Swingline Loan shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that on the date of such Swingline Loan such conditions have been met; (iii) each Swingline Loan shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $100,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof; and (iv) if an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, such additional terms and conditions of such AutoBorrow Agreement shall have been satisfied, and in the event that any of the terms of this Section 2.10(a) conflict with such AutoBorrow Agreement, the terms of such AutoBorrow Agreement shall govern and control. No Lender shall have any rights or obligations under any AutoBorrow Agreement, but each Lender shall have the obligation to purchase and fund risk participations in the Swingline Loans and to refinance Swingline Loans as provided below.
Facility
(b) . Within the limits expressed in this Agreement, amounts advanced pursuant to Section 2.10(a) may from time to time be borrowed, prepaid without penalty, and reborrowed. If the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans ever exceeds the Swingline Sublimit Amount, the Borrower shall, upon receipt of written notice of such condition from the Swingline Lender, prepay the outstanding principal of the Swingline Loans in the amount of such excess. If an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, each prepayment of a Swingline Borrowing shall be made as provided in such AutoBorrow Agreement.
Prepayment
 
(c) .
Reimbursements for Swingline Obligations
(i) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Swingline Lender the principal amount of such Swingline Loans and interest, fees, and other amounts owed by the Borrower with respect to the Swingline Loans when due and payable under the terms of this Agreement and, if an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, in accordance with the terms of such AutoBorrow Agreement. If the Borrower does not pay to the Swingline Lender any such amounts when due and payable, the Swingline Lender may upon notice to the Administrative Agent request the satisfaction of such obligation by the making of a Revolving Borrowing in the amount equal to such unpaid amount. Upon such request, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested the making of a Revolving Borrowing of ABR Loans in the amount of such obligation and the transfer of the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender. The Administrative Agent shall promptly forward notice of such Revolving Borrowing to the Borrower and the Lenders, and each Lender shall, regardless of whether (A) the conditions in Section 4.02 have been met, (B) such notice complies with Section 2.04, or (C) a Default has occurred and is continuing, make available such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver the proceeds thereof to the Swingline Lender for application to such amounts owed to the Swingline Lender. The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes, empowers, and directs the Swingline Lender to make such requests for Revolving Borrowings on behalf of the Borrower, and the Lenders to make Revolving Loans to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Swingline Lender in satisfaction of such obligations. The Administrative Agent and each Lender may record and otherwise treat the making of such Revolving Borrowings as the making of a Revolving Borrowing to the Borrower under this Agreement as if requested by the Borrower. Nothing herein is intended to release the Borrower's obligations with respect to Swingline Loans, but only to provide an additional method of payment therefor. The making of any Borrowing under this Section 2.10(c) shall not constitute a cure or waiver of any Default or Event of Default, other than the payment Default or Event of Default which is satisfied by the application of the amounts deemed advanced hereunder, caused by the Borrower's failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
(ii) If at any time, the Commitments shall have expired or be terminated while any Swingline Loan is outstanding, each Lender, at the sole option of the Swingline Lender, shall either (A) notwithstanding the expiration or termination of the Commitments, make a Revolving Loan as an ABR Loan, or (B) be deemed, without further action by any Person, to have purchased from the Swingline Lender a participation in such Swingline Loan, in either case in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Swingline Loans. The Administrative Agent shall notify each such Lender of the amount of such Revolving Loan or participation, and such Lender will transfer to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender on the next Business Day following such notice, in immediately available funds, the amount of such Revolving Loan or participation.
(iii) If any such Lender shall not have so made its Revolving Loan or its participation available to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10, such Lender agrees to pay interest thereon for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid at the lesser of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and
 
thereafter the interest rate applicable to the Revolving Loan and (B) the Maximum Rate. Whenever, at any time after the Administrative Agent has received from any Lender such Lender's Revolving Loan or participation in a Swingline Loan, the Administrative Agent receives any payment on account thereof, the Administrative Agent will pay to such Lender its participating interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's Revolving Loan or participating interest was outstanding and funded), which payment shall be subject to repayment by such Lender if such payment received by the Administrative Agent is required to be returned. Each Lender's obligation to make such Revolving Loan or purchase such participation pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (1) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have against the Swingline Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (2) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or the termination of the Commitments; (3) any breach of this Agreement by the Borrower or any other Lender; or (4) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. Each Swingline Loan, once so participated by any Lender, shall cease to be a Swingline Loan with respect to that amount for purposes of this Agreement, but shall continue to be a Revolving Loan.
(d) . If an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, each Swingline Borrowing shall be made as provided in such AutoBorrow Agreement or pursuant to a request in accordance with the immediately succeeding sentence. Except as provided in clause (c) above and except for Swingline Borrowings made pursuant to an AutoBorrow Agreement, each request for a Swingline Loan shall be made pursuant to telephone notice to the Swingline Lender given no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date of the proposed Swingline Loan, promptly confirmed by a completed and executed Notice of Borrowing sent by facsimile or, unless otherwise required by the Administrative Agent or Swingline Lender prior to such delivery, electronic mail (PDF), to the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender. The Borrower shall specify in its telephone notice, which shall be confirmed in the Notice of Borrowing, the interest rate at which such Swingline Borrowing shall bear interest in accordance with Section 2.13(c). If no election as to the interest rate is specified, then the requested Swingline Borrowing shall bear interest at the rate specified in Section 2.13(c)(i). The Swingline Lender will promptly (and in any event not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Notice of Borrowing) make the Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at the Borrower's account with the Administrative Agent.
Method of Borrowing
(e) . The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans (provided that any failure of the Swingline Lender to provide such invoice shall not release the Borrower from its obligation to pay such interest). Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or participation pursuant to clause (c) above, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Swingline Loans shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.
Interest for Account of Swingline Lender
(f) . The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.
Payments Directly to Swingline Lender
 
(g) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make a Swingline Loan at such time a Defaulting Lender exists hereunder, unless such Defaulting Lender's Fronting Exposure as to Swingline Loans has been fully reallocated or Cash Collateralized pursuant to Section 2.21 below or the Swingline Lender has entered into other arrangements (satisfactory to it in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Defaulting Lender to eliminate the Swingline Lender's risk with respect to such Defaulting Lender.
Defaulting Lender
Section 2.11 .
Prepayment of Loans
(a) . The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any principal amount of any Loan as provided in this Section 2.11 and, with respect to Swingline Loans, Section 2.10(b). Each payment of any Loan pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be made in a manner such that all Loans comprising part of the same Borrowing are paid in whole or ratably in part (other than Loans owing to a Defaulting Lender as provided in Section 2.21).
Right to Prepay; Ratable Prepayment
(b) . The Borrower may elect to prepay the Loans without penalty or premium (except as set forth in Section 2.16) by giving notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by facsimile or, unless otherwise required by the Administrative Agent prior to such delivery, electronic mail (PDF)) of such prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.03. Full prepayments of any Borrowing are permitted without restriction of amounts. In addition to the foregoing, if an AutoBorrow Agreement is in effect, any prepayment of Swingline Loans may also be made as provided in such AutoBorrow Agreement.
Optional

(c) . If, on any Business Day, the aggregate Credit Exposures of all Lenders exceeds the Aggregate Commitment (an ""), then the Borrower shall, within two Business Days after the earlier of (A) the Borrower's receipt of written notice of an Excess from the Administrative Agent and (B) the date any Responsible Officer of the Borrower has actual knowledge of such Excess, solely to the extent of such Excess: , prepay to the Swingline Lender the outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans; and , prepay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the Lenders, in whole or in part, a principal amount of Revolving Loans comprising part of the same Borrowing(s) selected by the Borrower that will eliminate the Excess; provided, that in the event an Excess remains after prepayment in full of all of the Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall deposit Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the remaining Excess into the Cash Collateral Account.

(a) . The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of such Lender's unused Commitment during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof.

All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to any fees accruing during such period pursuant to this Section 2.12(a) (without prejudice to the rights of the Non-Defaulting Lenders in respect of such fees).
Commitment Fees
(b) . The Borrower agrees to pay:
Fees for Letters of Credit
(i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to each Lender's participations in (A) Performance Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure attributable to Performance Letters of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (B) Letters of Credit other than Performance Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure attributable to such Letters of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure; and

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office

Each Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies that are generally applicable to other borrowers and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would avoid the need for such notice and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fees under Section 2.12(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).

No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation.
Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure

no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the benefit of the Lender Parties, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions except as expressly provided in this Article VIII. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Legal Requirement. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
Appointment and Authority
Section 8.02 . The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities, act as
Rights as a Lender

Wells Fargo (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent) and its Affiliates may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Subsidiary for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks.

Exculpatory Provisions
(a) The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this Section shall include its Related Parties) shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing,
(ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Legal Requirement, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
(iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided herein) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or unlawful act as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender, the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 9.02) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required Lenders, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lender Parties.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any recital, statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the inspection of, or to inspect, the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vii) any litigation or collection proceedings (or to initiate or conduct any such litigation or proceedings) under any Loan Document unless requested by the Required Lenders in writing and it receives indemnification satisfactory to it from the Lenders.
Section 8.04 . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document, writing or other communication (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of Loan or any conversion or continuance of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender, the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank unless such Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender, the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or conversion or continuance of a Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Reliance by Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Banks
Section 8.05 . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct or committed an unlawful act in the selection of such sub-agents.

Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, (i) the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the prior written consent of the Borrower (which consent is not required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint, as applicable, a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as may be agreed by the Required Lenders and, if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.
(b) Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent hereunder, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents except pursuant to obligations that by their terms expressly survive such resignation (including Section 9.12). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
(c) The Swingline Lender may resign at any time by concurrently resigning as Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.07(a) and (b).

Upon such notice of resignation, the Borrower shall have the right to designate any other Lender as the Swingline Lender with the consent of such Lender so long as operational matters related to the funding of Loans have been adequately addressed to the reasonable satisfaction of such new Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent (if such new Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent are not the same Person). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Person serving as the Swingline Lender may not resign pursuant to the above provisions of this Section 8.07 unless such Person is, at the same time, resigning in its capacity as the Administrative Agent.

The rights of each Lender Party under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender Party may have. Each Lender Party agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

Section 9.12 . Each Lender Party agrees to maintain (and to cause their respective Related Parties to maintain) the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to any other Lender Party or to any Affiliate of any Lender Party, or any director, officer, employee or agent of any Lender Party, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory authority exercising jurisdiction over such Person, (c) to the extent required by any applicable Legal Requirement or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (e) subject to an executed written agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.12, to (i) any eligible assignee of or
Confidentiality
 
Participant in, or any prospective eligible assignee of or prospective Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap, securitization or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (f) with the prior written consent of the Borrower or (g) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Lender Party on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower (excluding any Information from a source which the Lender Party knows has been disclosed by such source in violation of a duty of confidentiality to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates). For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from or on behalf of the Borrower relating to the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower or their business, other than any such information that is available to the Lender Parties on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower (excluding any Information from a source which such Lender Party knows has been disclosed by such source in violation of a duty of confidentiality to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates); that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. This Section shall survive and remain in full force and effect for a period of one year after the date that the Obligations have been repaid in full, no LC Exposure is outstanding and all of the Commitments have terminated or expired.

Section 9.13 . It is the intent of the Borrower and each Lender in the execution and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to contract in strict compliance with applicable usury laws, including conflicts of law concepts, governing the Loans of each Lender including such applicable Legal Requirements of the State of New York, if any, and the United States of America from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof, the Lenders and the Borrower stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Rate and that for purposes of this Agreement "interest" shall include the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under such Legal Requirements that are contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement; and in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, under any circumstances the aggregate amounts taken, reserved, charged, received or paid on the Loans, include amounts which by applicable Legal Requirement are deemed interest which would exceed the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be deemed to be a mistake and each Lender receiving same shall credit the same on the principal of its Loans (or if such Loans shall have been paid in full, refund said excess to the Borrower). In the event that the maturity of the
Usury Not Intended
 
Loans is accelerated by reason of any election of the holder thereof resulting from any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include more than the Maximum Rate, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the applicable Loans (or, if the applicable Loans shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrower of such interest). In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable under any specific contingencies exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrower and the Lenders shall to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal parts during the period of the full stated term of the Loans all amounts considered to be interest under applicable Legal Requirement at any time contracted for, charged, received or reserved in connection with the Obligations. The provisions of this Section shall control over all other provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which may be in apparent conflict herewith.
Section 9.14 . In the event the rate of interest chargeable under this Agreement at any time is greater than the Maximum Rate, the unpaid principal amount of the Loans shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the Loans equals the amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued on the Loans if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In the event the Lenders ever receive, collect or apply as interest any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess amount shall, to the extent permitted by Legal Requirement, be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans, and if no such principal is then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to the Borrower.
Usury Recapture
Section 9.15 To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to any Lender Party, or any Lender Party exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any Lender Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender Party severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
Payments Set Aside.
Section 9.16 . Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
USA PATRIOT Act
 
Section 9.17 . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with usual and customary banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at any of the Administrative Agent's offices in the United States of America on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender Party hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender Party may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender Party in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender Party against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender Party in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.18(c), each Lender Party agrees to promptly remit such excess to the Borrower.
Judgment Currency
Section 9.18 . It is not intended that any certificate of any officer or director of the Borrower delivered to any Lender Party pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any personal liability on the part of such officer or director.

Prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in October 1995 (the "Initial Public Offering"), we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation ("Loews"). In connection with the Initial Public Offering, we entered into agreements with Loews pursuant to which Loews provides certain management, administrative and other services to us and certain other obligations were assumed by the parties. These agreements were not the result of arm's length negotiations between the parties.
. We entered into a services agreement with Loews effective upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering pursuant to which Loews agreed to continue to perform certain administrative and technical services on our behalf. These services include personnel, internal auditing, accounting and cash management services, in addition to advice and assistance with respect to preparation of tax returns and obtaining insurance. Under the services agreement, we reimburse Loews for (i) allocated personnel costs (such as salaries, employee benefits and payroll taxes) of the Loews personnel actually providing such services and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses related to the provision of such services. The services agreement may be terminated at our option upon 30 days' notice to Loews and at the option of Loews upon six months' notice to us. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Loews for all claims and damages arising from the provision of services by Loews under the services agreement, unless due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Loews.
Services Agreement
. Under a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 16, 1995, as amended, between us and Loews, subject to certain limitations, we will file, upon the request of Loews, one or more registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to a maximum of two remaining requests, in order to permit Loews to offer and sell any of our common stock that Loews may hold. Loews will bear the costs of any such registered offering, including any underwriting commissions relating to shares it sells in any such offering, any related transfer taxes and the costs of complying with non-U.S. securities laws, and any fees and expenses of separate counsel and accountants retained by Loews. We have the right to require Loews to delay any exercise by Loews of its rights to require registration and other actions for a period of up to 90 days if, in our judgment, any offering by us then being conducted or about to be conducted would be adversely affected. In addition, we have the right to require Loews to suspend the use of any resale prospectus or prospectus supplement included in a "shelf" registration statement for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 90 days in any one instance or an aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period, if we are conducting or about to conduct an underwritten public offering of our securities for our own account, or would be required to disclose information regarding our company not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed where such disclosure would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any material business transaction or negotiation in which we are then engaged. Subject to certain conditions, we have also granted Loews the right to include its shares of our common stock in any registration statements covering offerings of our common stock by us, and we will pay all costs of such offerings other than underwriting commissions and transfer taxes attributable to the shares sold on behalf of Loews. We will indemnify Loews, and Loews will indemnify us, against certain liabilities in respect of any registration statement or offering covered by the registration rights agreement, as amended.
Registration Rights Agreement
 
. From time to time we purchase performance and appeal bonds in support of our drilling operations offshore Mexico and workers compensation claims, respectively, from Affiliates of a majority-owned subsidiary of Loews after obtaining competitive quotes.
Performance and Appeal Bonds
. From time to time, we hire marine vessels and helicopter transportation services at the prevailing market rate from subsidiaries of SEACOR Holdings Inc. The Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of SEACOR Holdings Inc. is also one of our directors.
Other
. From time to time we make payments to Ernst & Young LLP for tax and other consulting services. The wife of Lawrence R. Dickerson, our President and Chief Executive Officer and one of our directors, is an audit partner at this firm.
