HOUSTON, October 18, 2012
NYSE: DO

"We posted excellent operating results for the quarter and announced several new contracts at strong dayrates across all ranges of water depths," said Larry Dickerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Diamond Offshore. "Our results for the quarter benefited from lower than anticipated operating expense, primarily owing to our continued emphasis on controlling costs."
"During the quarter, we entered into a $750 million revolving credit facility, which will provide additional flexibility to our already strong balance sheet, as we complete construction of six new rigs over the next two years," said Dickerson. "Among our industry peers, Diamond Offshore's balance sheet is the least levered, and we enjoy the highest credit ratings."
