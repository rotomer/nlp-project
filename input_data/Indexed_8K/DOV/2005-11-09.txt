Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On November 3, 2005, the Board of Directors of Dover Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's 2005 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to provide for stock-settled stock appreciation rights as a type of award that may be granted under the Plan. The conditions and limits on the grant of equity-based incentive compensation remain unchanged. This amendment will become effective on January 1, 2006.
     In addition, the Board of Directors also approved an amendment to the Plan to reduce the normal retirement age from 65 to 62. Outstanding grants under the Company's 1995 Stock Option Incentive Plan and 1995 Cash Performance Program were likewise amended. Such amendments became effective on November 3, 2005. The change in normal retirement age was made to coordinate the provisions relating to retirement age among various of the Company's employee benefit plans.
