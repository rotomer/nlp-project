Exhibit 99.1
New York, New York, July 25, 2006  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, it had record earnings from continuing operations of $158.7 million or $0.77 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $109.5 million or $0.54 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing significant increases of 45% and 44%, respectively. Revenue for the second quarter of 2006 was $1,655.4 million, an increase of 24% over the prior-year period. Earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006 included $0.02 EPS related to the expensing of stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2006 were $71.9 million or $0.35 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $86.7 million or $0.42 EPS, compared to net earnings of $173.2 million or $0.85 EPS for the same period of 2005, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $63.7 million or $0.31 EPS. Included in the 2005 period was a gain from the sale of a business, while the 2006 quarterly results include impairments related to discontinued companies.
Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 were $290.0 million or $1.41 EPS, up 44%, compared to $201.1 million or $0.98 EPS in the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2006 included $0.04 EPS related to the expensing of stock options and stock appreciation rights. Net earnings were $275.7 million or $1.34 EPS, compared to $271.3 million or $1.33 EPS in the prior year.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated: "Dover had an excellent second quarter, generating record revenue and earnings, significant operating margin improvement and strong cash flow. Our record performance was driven by a strong organic growth rate of 17% as well as significant contributions from our recent acquisitions. Dover's ability to deliver consecutive double-digit increases in organic growth validates our focus on operational excellence and our highly successful "Performance Counts" initiative. Our operating margin increased 200 basis points over the previous year and is now approaching 16%. It's also important to note that 74% of Dover's second quarter revenue was generated by operating companies with margins above 15% and that 37% of our revenue in the quarter was attributable to companies with inventory turns of greater than eight. We reinvested a portion of Dover's free cash flow, which was 8.4% of revenue, in the acquisition of O'Neil Product Development Inc., a synergistic addition to our Product Identification group. We also purchased 700,000 shares of Dover's stock on the open market. Going forward, we anticipate the acquisition pipeline to remain active and are engaged in a number of evaluations and negotiations."
 
Dover also announced today that it discontinued seven businesses during the second quarter of 2006  five from the Dover Technologies segment, one from Dover Electronics and one from Dover Industries. The five discontinued businesses from Dover Technologies are Universal Instruments, Hover-Davis, Vitronics Soltec and Alphasem from the Circuit Assembly and Test Group and Mark Andy from the Product Identification Group. In 2005, these five businesses had total revenue and earnings of $580.2 million and $26.7 million, respectively, and the 2006 year-to-date revenue and earnings were $291.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The two other businesses that Dover discontinued were Kurz-Kasch, from the Dover Electronics' Components Group, and a product line in the Dover Industries' segment. These seven businesses collectively generated an operating margin of 4.3% for the full year 2005 and 2.9% for 2006 year-to-date.
As a result of classifying these businesses as discontinued operations, Dover's overall margin from continuing operations in both the second quarter and year-to-date 2006 have improved by 120 basis points, and by 100 basis points in both of the comparable 2005 periods. The company anticipates that continued strong organic growth, as well as the full-year effect of its 2005 acquisitions, should offset the majority of the reduction in revenue and earnings related to these discontinued operations in 2006.
Commenting on this announcement, Mr. Hoffman stated, "These divestitures represent the culmination of the strategic portfolio review that we initiated in January 2005, when I became Chief Executive Officer, to position Dover as a vehicle for more consistent and sustainable value creation over the long term. Each of our six subsidiary Presidents played a vital role in this important evaluation process. The majority of the companies identified for sale manufacture capital equipment where the served markets are narrow in scope and recurring revenue opportunities are limited. While making decisions of this kind is never easy, we are confident that the sale of these businesses will enhance our ability to generate more consistent and sustained revenue and earnings growth. Despite the substantial reduction of our exposure to the technology sector, Dover will maintain a solid presence in core technology markets where it has well-established leadership positions and can capitalize on attractive recurring revenue opportunities. Dover also remains keenly committed to maintaining its strong and growing position in the Product Identification market.
"This strategic rebalancing of our portfolio, which is now substantially complete, coupled with our improved operational performance driven by the "Performance Counts" program and the continued success of our organic growth initiatives, position Dover well in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," concluded Mr. Hoffman.
In connection with the discontinuance of the seven businesses, Dover recorded an after-tax charge of $87.9 million, reflecting the anticipated loss on sale for certain of these businesses. Any gains from the sale of the seven businesses will be recorded upon the close of the transactions.
Assuming all businesses currently in discontinued operations are sold by the end of 2006, the Company anticipates receiving after-tax proceeds in the range of $325 million.
All of Dover's results are presented on a comparable basis to reflect the discontinuance of the seven operations for all periods presented.
