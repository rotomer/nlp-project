Exhibit 99.1
New York, New York, October 24, 2006  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006, it had earnings from continuing operations of $156.3 million or $0.76 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $123.0 million or $0.60 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 27% and 26%, respectively. Revenue for the third quarter of 2006 was $1,651.9 million, an increase of 21% over the prior-year period. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 included $0.02 EPS related to the expensing of stock options and stock appreciation rights.
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were $167.5 million or $0.82 EPS, including earnings from discontinued operations of $11.2 million or $0.05 EPS, compared to net earnings of $122.7 million or $0.60 EPS for the same period of 2005, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $0.4 million and no EPS impact.
Earnings from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 increased 38% to $446.3 million, or $2.17 EPS, compared to the prior year, and included $0.06 EPS related to the expensing of stock options and stock appreciation rights. Net earnings were $443.3 million or $2.16 EPS, compared to $394.0 million or $1.93 EPS in the prior year.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated: "Dover continues to post very positive comparative results with a 27% earnings increase on a 21% increase in sales for the third quarter. We also had a positive book to bill in the quarter. These results reflect continued strong performances at a number of Dover's key platforms, particularly the Oil and Gas, Electronic Components, Product Identification, Mobile Equipment and Process Equipment Groups. We continue to generate strong, double-digit organic growth and have also realized a significant positive impact from our recent acquisitions. Quarterly free cash flow of $240 million was 15% of quarterly sales and 154% of quarterly net earnings. Our robust cash generation reflects Dover's focus on working capital improvements in our operating companies. This is driven by the Dover metrics and the Performance Counts initiatives and validates our rebalanced portfolio of higher margin operating companies. We are also excited about the addition of Paladin Brands to the Dover family. Paladin serves a broad array of construction, demolition, utility and forestry customers with an extensive line of specialty attachments and tools sold primarily through a diverse distribution network.
Looking ahead, Dover enters the fourth quarter with record backlogs and demand remains strong in the Oil and Gas, Electronic Components, Product Identification and Process Equipment Groups. However, light construction and automotive markets continue to decline and semiconductor markets remain soft. Overall, we anticipate a solid fourth quarter, well ahead of prior year results, but moderating somewhat from the third quarter of 2006
 
given the effects of acquisition accounting costs at Paladin and Markem as well as the normal impact of the holiday season."
