Press Release of Dover Corporation, dated January 31, 2007

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
New York, New York, January 31, 2007  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, earnings from continuing operations were $156.1 million or $0.76 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $121.6 million or $0.60 EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases of 28% and 27%, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 included a charge of $0.02 EPS related to stock option expense. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1,714.7 million, an increase of 20% over the prior-year period.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, Dover's earnings from continuing operations increased 35% to $603.3 million, or $2.94 EPS, compared to the prior year, and included a charge of $0.08 EPS related to stock option expense. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6,511.6 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year.
Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated: "We are very pleased to report record fourth quarter and full year results. Our organic growth was 14%, we made further progress with our "program and we generated strong operating cash flow of over $880 million, up 57% over the prior year. We also invested a record $1.1 billion in 2006 in new companies, including Paladin and Markem, which are expected to be value creating for many years to come.
PerformanceCOUNTS
"
"Looking to 2007, we anticipate building upon the successes of 2006 and the progress made through our "program, along with contributions from our acquisitions to deliver another record setting year. As always, we will face challenges as we try to achieve these ambitious goals. We start the year with a good backlog, up 21% over the prior year period, and many of our groups continue to exhibit strength and participate in healthy end-markets, including energy, product identification and heat exchangers. However, given our normal quarterly seasonality pattern, the impact of recent acquisitions, and some near-term softness in end-markets related to construction, foodservice, and electronics, we expect the first quarter to moderate from the 2006 fourth quarter. Thereafter, assuming economic conditions remain positive, we anticipate meaningful improvements in quarterly performance over comparable prior year periods through the balance of the year."
PerformanceCOUNTS
"
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $118.5 million or $0.58 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $37.6 million or $0.18 EPS, compared to $116.1 million or $0.57 EPS for the same period in 2005, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $5.5 million or $0.03 EPS. Full year 2006 net earnings were $561.8 million or $2.73 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $41.5 million or $0.20 EPS, compared to $510.1 million or $2.50 EPS in the prior year, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $63.9 million or $0.31 EPS.
 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company acquired three companies: Markem in the Technologies segment Product Identification group, and two small add-ons in the Resources segment, for a total purchase price of $605 million. It also discontinued three small businesses in the Diversified segment, completed the sales of five companies and adjusted the carrying value of other previously discontinued businesses resulting in an after-tax loss of $37.4 million, or $0.18 EPS. The three businesses discontinued in the fourth quarter had a negligible impact on operating results. At year end 2006, six business units were being held for sale. Current year acquisitions, which totaled $1.1 billion, were primarily funded by cash from operations and proceeds from dispositions.
Growth Factors
Cash Flow
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities.
The full year increase reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, and lower tax payments, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. In addition, adjusted working capital (calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from the prior year end by $262.3 million as a result of acquisitions, foreign exchange translation and the Company's organic growth. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, working capital increased $41.3 million. Working capital as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.9% from 20.7% at year end 2005.
Capitalization
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
 
Net debt at December 31, 2006 remained relatively flat as a result of the increase in cash flow from operations and cash proceeds generated from the sales of discontinued businesses that funded Dover's acquisition program. The percentage decrease in net debt to total capital, after record acquisition spending, reflects strong operational free cash flow and proceeds from dispositions of $446.0 million.
Tax Rate
The 2006 fourth quarter effective tax rate for continuing operations was 22.6%, which reflected the effect of the full year retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal research credit and a favorable mix of foreign earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. The 2005 fourth quarter tax rate for continuing operations was 25.6%, which included benefits related to the settlement of certain U.S. federal and state tax issues.
The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.7%, reflecting the same factors that impacted the fourth quarter rate, as well as a lower relative United States federal tax exclusion for foreign sales in 2006. The 2005 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.5% included a $9.5 million provision related to the repatriation of $373.7 million of dividends and a $25.5 million benefit primarily related to the resolution of U.S. tax issues and a $5.5 million benefit related to a favorable federal tax court decision. Excluding the repatriation provision, the full year 2005 tax rate for continuing operations was 24.9%.
