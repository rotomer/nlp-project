EXHIBIT 99.1
New York, New York, July 25, 2007  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007, it had earnings from continuing operations of $175.1 million or $0.85 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $158.8 million or $0.77 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, both representing increases of 10%. Revenue for the second quarter of 2007 was $1.859 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior-year period.
Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $314.0 million or $1.52 EPS, compared to $290.1 million or $1.41 EPS in the prior-year period, both representing increases of 8%. Revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2007 was $3.639 billion, up 15% over the prior year period.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated: "We are pleased to report another record-setting quarter at Dover. We set all-time quarterly records with earnings from continuing operations of $175 million, diluted earnings per share of $0.85 and revenue of $1.9 billion. Continuing earnings increased 10% over the second quarter of 2006 while revenue was up 12% over the same period. Additionally, bookings for the quarter were a record $1.9 billion, a 17% increase over the comparable period of 2006 and we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $1.6 billion."
Mr. Hoffman continued, "Our second quarter performance primarily reflected earnings contributions from acquisitions in Material Handling and Product Identification and strength in the Process Equipment, Mobile Equipment and Oil & Gas Equipment Groups, which more than offset weakness in the Automation & Measurement Group. Sequentially, all segments showed improvement in earnings and sales and all had positive leverage, with operating margins up 200 basis points to 15.0%. Our PerformanceCOUNTS program continues to drive world class performance across our operating companies, as we hit four out of five target metrics for the second quarter. Further evidence of our operational focus can be found in our free cash flow generation of $218 million in the second quarter which was 11.7% of revenue, bringing the six month free cash flow total to $235 million, or 6.5% of revenue.
"Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect moderate growth in organic revenue and earnings assuming the global economy stays healthy, and a modest improvement in the A & M Group. Taking into account the earnings contributions of 2006 acquisitions and a strong performance in most of our industrial markets, we anticipate that the third quarter will be another record-setting quarter.
"The remainder of the year will be an exciting time at Dover. Late in the third quarter we will announce a new organizational structure which better aligns Dover's operating companies with broadly served markets,
 
enhances our strategic acquisition focus and increases our shareholder transparency. We will also continue to be highly disciplined in our acquisition activity to ensure our capital is allocated in an efficient manner. While we didn't close on any acquisitions in the second quarter, we did repurchase 1 million shares during that timeframe, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.5 million shares. Finally, I'd like to thank our dedicated employees around the world for producing a great quarter in the face of a dynamic and competitive market."
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $172.2 million or $0.84 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million or $0.01 EPS, compared to net earnings of $71.9 million or $0.35 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $86.8 million or $0.42 EPS. Net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $301.1 million or $1.46 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $12.8 million or $0.06 EPS, compared to net earnings of $275.7 million or $1.34 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $14.3 million or $0.07 EPS.
