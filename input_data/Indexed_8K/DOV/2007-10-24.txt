New York, New York, October 24, 2007  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007, it had earnings from continuing operations of $177.9 million or $0.88 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $155.3 million or $0.76 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 15% and 16%, respectively. Revenue for the third quarter of 2007 was $1.84 billion, an increase of 15% over the prior-year period.
Earnings from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $484.4 million or $2.36 EPS, compared to $437.9 million or $2.13 EPS in the prior-year period, both representing increases of 11%. Revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2007 was $5.37 billion, up 15% over the prior year period.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated: "I am pleased to announce another excellent quarter at Dover with operating margins of 15.5%, a 30 bps improvement over the prior year period. Dover also produced strong free cash flow of $180.0 million, or 9.8% of revenue. Further, we continued to deliver on our PERFORMANCECOUNTS program by achieving 4 of 5 target metrics for the second quarter in a row.
Mr. Hoffman continued, "Our revenue increase of 15% reflects organic growth of 3.3%, acquisition growth of 9.6%, and a 2.0% benefit from foreign exchange. Excluding the Electronics Technology segment, the Industrial Products, Engineered Systems and Fluid Management segments fared even better, by producing combined organic growth of 5.9% in the third quarter. Overall growth was driven by strong performances in the Product Identification, Material Handling and Energy platforms.
"We also made two major announcements during the quarter. First, we initiated a $500 million share repurchase program of which approximately $300 million has been acquired thus far with the balance expected to be repurchased over the next few months. Second, we implemented a new organizational structure which identifies the true growth platforms of Dover and provides increased clarity for our investors. The new structure will maximize opportunities for improved operational efficiency and provide a framework for capitalizing on potential synergies.
"Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate the continuation of a solid but moderating business climate. We also expect to incur discrete integration and restructuring charges currently estimated in the range of $.02 to $.03 EPS as we continue to improve our business activities for sustainable long-term performance. Given these factors, plus the normal effects of seasonality, we expect our fourth quarter performance will show modest improvement over the same period last year."
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $174.6 million or $0.86 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $3.3 million or $0.02 EPS, compared to net earnings of $167.5 million or $0.82 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included income from discontinued operations of $12.2 million or $0.06 EPS. Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $475.7 million or $2.32 EPS, including a loss from
 
discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS, compared to net earnings of $443.3 million or $2.16 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included income from discontinued operations of $5.4 million or $0.03 EPS.
