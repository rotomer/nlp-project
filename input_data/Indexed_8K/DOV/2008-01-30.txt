EXHIBIT 99.1
January 30, 2008
New York, New York, January 30, 2008  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007, it had earnings from continuing operations of $168.9 million or $0.86 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $154.6 million or $0.75 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 9% and 14%, respectively. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $1.86 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior-year period.
Earnings from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 were $653.3 million or $3.22 EPS, compared to $592.5 million or $2.88 EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases of 10% and 12%, respectively. Revenue for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2007 was $7.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. In addition, free cash flow for the year was $727.7 million, or 10.1% of revenue.
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald L. Hoffman, stated:
"We are pleased to report Dover's fourth quarter and full-year results. Our diluted EPS for the full year surpassed our previous high by 12%. This performance was even more impressive given that it was accomplished in the face of headwinds in portions of our Electronic Technologies and Industrial Products segments. Company-wide organic growth for the fourth quarter was 2.8% and 2.3% for the full year. Organic growth for our core industrial businesses (excluding Electronic Technologies) was 4.6% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full-year indicating solid performance across our broad industrial business base.
"In addition to our strong financial results, Dover undertook several major initiatives in 2007 to enhance the long-term success of our company. First, we optimized Dover's operating structure by re-aligning into four defined industry segments with six business platforms. This new simplified structure gives us sharper focus on our major end markets and related acquisition program, accelerates the sharing of best practices and realization of business synergies, and facilitates management development. Second, we adjusted our capital allocation to reflect the value we felt was inherent in our company versus the available external opportunities, by announcing two successive share repurchase programs during the year which will reduce the outstanding share count by roughly 10%. In 2007, we repurchased 12.4 million shares for $591 million and have added another million shares to that total in early 2008. Additionally, we spent $274 million on strategic add-on acquisitions, including Pole/Zero and Camco, which considerably strengthened both our Microwave Products Group and Material Handling Platform. Lastly, we launched a new initiative to capture synergies throughout our organization. Although we are early in the process, we are highly encouraged by the scope of the potential synergy opportunities and are confident they can bring meaningful improvement to our bottom line.
"Looking forward to 2008, assuming a reasonably stable global economy, we are encouraged that our recent strategic initiatives will enable Dover to improve full year earnings per share in the 10%+ range, despite headwinds in a few of our end-markets. We strongly believe in the positive direction Dover is headed and are confident our new structure, capital allocation model and synergy initiatives have laid solid groundwork for future growth. We also anticipate increased opportunities to expand our identified platforms through value-creating
 
add-on acquisitions. Lastly, I'd once again like to thank the 34,000 employees of Dover around the globe for their tireless efforts, professionalism and dedication to improving Dover every day. Without their vital daily contributions, none of our current or future successes would be possible."
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $185.4 million or $0.94 EPS, including income from discontinued operations of $16.5 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $118.5 million or $0.58 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $36.0 million or $0.18 EPS. Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 were $661.1 million or $3.26 EPS, including income from discontinued operations of $7.8 million or $0.04 EPS, compared to net earnings of $561.8 million or $2.73 EPS for the same period of 2006, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $30.7 million or $0.15 EPS.

The webcast can be accessed at the Dover Corporation website at The conference call will also be made available for replay on the website and additional information on Dover's fourth quarter 2007 results and its operating companies can also be found on the Company website.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Share Repurchase Program
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company purchased 4.8 million of its outstanding shares for $222 million under two previously announced programs that collectively authorized the purchase of approximately 20 million shares of Dover common stock. During 2007, the Company purchased a total of 12.4 million shares under the programs for $591 million. In 2008 (through January 29th), the Company purchased an additional one million shares at a cost of $40 million, leaving the balance of the Board's authorization at about $420 million.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company completed two add-on acquisitions: Camco, formerly Industrial Motion Controls LLC (De-Sta-Co) in the Industrial Products segment and Windrock Inc. (Gas Equipment Group) in the Fluid Management segment, for a total purchase price of $97.1 million. During 2007, Dover made a total of seven add-on acquisitions, totaling $273.6 million, net of cash acquired.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company completed the sale of a previously discontinued business and recorded other adjustments resulting in an after-tax gain of $0.3 million. For 2007, the Company finalized the sales of a total of six businesses resulting in an after-tax loss of $17.1 million. At year end 2007, two businesses remain held for sale.
Growth Factors
Cash Flow
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) with cash flows from operating activities.
 
The full year increase in free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher tax payments in 2007. In addition, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from the prior year end by $29.1 million, or 2% to $1,363.0 million which reflected an increase in receivables of $57.4 million, a decrease in inventory of $13.0 million and an increase in accounts payable of $15.3 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, working capital would have decreased by $50.1 million, or 4%. Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) increased to 19.2% at December 31, 2007 from 19.0% at December 31, 2006.
Capitalization
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
Net debt at December 31, 2007 increased $92 million as a result of increased commercial paper borrowings used primarily to fund the Company's share repurchase programs during 2007. The percentage increase in net debt to total capital, after $591 million of share repurchases, reflects strong operational free cash flow and net proceeds from dispositions of $91 million.
Tax Rate
The Company's effective tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006 was 24.1% and 22.9%, respectively. Both periods were favorably impacted by the mix of foreign earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. The higher rate in the 2007 period was caused by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits as required under FIN 48, while the 2006 period was favorably impacted by the effect of the full year retroactive extension of the U.S. Federal research tax credit.
The 2007 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.4%, reflecting the same factors that affected the fourth quarter 2007 rate. The 2006 tax rate for continuing operations of 26.8% also reflected the same factors that impacted the fourth quarter rate, as well as a lower relative United States federal tax exclusion for foreign sales in 2006.
