He became President of Ronningen-Petter in 1971 and was subsequently promoted to increased responsibilities as president of two other Dover companies (De-Sta-Co and Norris).

In 1993, Mr. Reece was named President, Chief Operating Officer and a director of Dover. He became Chief Executive Officer in 1994, and was elected as Chairman of the Board in 1999.
Mr. Reece commented: "I have enjoyed a wonderful relationship with Dover, and I will miss my association with the many great people who have made Dover the successful company that it is today. I offer my sincerest thanks for their support and friendship over my long career. I most fervently wish the best of continued success for all of them, as well as for Dover Corporation, for many years to come. At the same time, I look forward to having more time to spend with family and pursue various philanthropic activities."
