Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 6, 2008, the Board of Directors of Dover Corporation amended the provisions of Articles II and III of Dover's Bylaws relating to stockholder proposals and nominations of directors, and the provisions of Article XII relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses, among other matters: (1) to modify the specified periods in advance of stockholder meetings within which stockholders must provide notice of nominations or proposals of other business; (2) to expand the information that must be provided by any stockholder who submits a nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a meeting to include, for example, a description of any hedging or other transactions entered into by the proponent or any beneficial owner(s) as of the date of the proposal and as of the record date, the intent or effect of which is to increase or decrease the voting power or economic risk of the stockholder or any such beneficial owner(s) with respect to Dover's stock; (3) to provide that a stockholder proponent or a qualified representative must appear at the stockholder meeting and present the proponent's nomination or proposal; and (4) to clarify that the rights to indemnification and advancement provided for in Article XII vest when a covered person first becomes a director, officer, employee or agent and not when an action, suit or proceeding that is subject to indemnification and advancement is first threatened, commenced or completed.
The foregoing is only a brief summary of the Bylaws amendments and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Company's Bylaws, as amended on November 6, 2008, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3(ii) and incorporated herein by reference.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (, , that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if
provided
however
 
elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and all beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of any such beneficial owners, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and any such beneficial owners, (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal between or among such stockholder and/or any such beneficial owners, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder and any such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the corporation, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or any such beneficial owners, with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, (v) a representation (a) that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (b) whether the stockholder (and any beneficial owners on whose behalf the proposal is made) intends to continue to hold the shares through the date of the annual meeting, (vi) a representation whether the stockholder or any of the beneficial owners intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock which, together with the holdings of such stockholder and all such beneficial owners, is sufficient to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee, and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, and (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and any such beneficial owners required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this section 4 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his, her or its intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit
 
proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information required by clauses (A)(2)(c)(ii), (A)(2)(c)(iii) and (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this section 4 shall be updated by such stockholder and any such beneficial owners not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such information as of the record date.

          (B) Special meetings of stockholders.

In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this section 4 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

(1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 4 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 4. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section 4 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(vi) of this section 4), and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this section 4, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section 4, unless otherwise required by law or expressly waived in writing by the corporation, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this section 4, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

Nothing in this
provided
however
 
section 4 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation.
     5. . At all meetings of the stockholders, each stockholder entitled to vote shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock standing on record in his or her name, subject to any restrictions or qualifications set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto.

At any stockholders' meeting, a majority of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereat represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum, but a smaller interest may adjourn any meeting from time to time, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority in interest of the stock entitled to vote represented thereat shall decide any question brought before such meeting unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these By-laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern.
Quorum at stockholders' meetings
     7. . Each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, that if, as of the 10 business day preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this section, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election).
Election of Directors
provided
th
     In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee for further service on the Board of Directors, such person shall submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, a committee designated by the Board of Directors shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release and, if necessary, filing an appropriate disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision, within 90 days following certification of the election results. The committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that they
 
consider appropriate and relevant. A director whose resignation is being considered shall not participate in the recommendation of the committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.
     If the Board of Directors accepts a director's resignation pursuant to this section, or if a nominee for director is not elected in an election which is not a Contested Election and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to Article V of these By-laws.
     8. . At least ten days before every election of directors, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the election, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be prepared by the Secretary. Such list shall be open, during normal business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation for ten days, subject to examination by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting. Such list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of election during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. Upon the willful neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any election, they shall be ineligible to any office at such election. The original or duplicate stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine such list pursuant to this section or to vote in person or by proxy at such election.
List of stockholders to be filed, etc

A board of directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, or at a special meeting held in lieu thereof as above provided, who shall serve until the election and qualification of their successors or their earlier resignation or removal. The number of directors shall be such as may be determined from time to time by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, but in no event shall the number be less than three.

Right to Indemnification
 
or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter by amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; , , that except as provided in section 2 hereof with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; , , that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise.

     2. . If a claim under section 1 of this Article XII is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
 
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

The corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation who was or is serving at the corporation's request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person has collected as indemnification or advancement of the same expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity.
Insurance; Other Sources
     5. . Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article XII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
