Exhibit 99.1
January 28, 2009
New York, New York, January 28, 2009  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, it had earnings from continuing operations of $169.6 million or $0.91 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $175.1 million or $0.89 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period. Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.73 billion, a decrease of 8% over the prior year period. Net acquisition growth of 1% was offset by a 6% decline in organic revenue and a 3% negative impact of foreign exchange.
Earnings from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 were $694.8 million or $3.67 EPS, compared to $669.8 million or $3.30 EPS in the prior year period, representing increases of 4% and 11%, respectively. Revenue from continuing operations for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2008 was $7.57 billion, up 3% over the prior year period due to organic growth of 1%, net acquisition growth of 1% and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 1%.
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "Our fourth quarter earnings represent a strong finish to our record 2008 performance, despite a weaker global economy. We had improved operating margins in the quarter of 15.3%, up 70 basis points over the prior year period. In addition, we delivered free cash flow of $228 million representing 13.2% of revenue, while our full-year free cash flow was $835 million, or 11.0% of revenue. We achieved an impressive 120% cash conversion rate and we will continue to put great emphasis on cash flow through such programs as , synergy capture and global procurement. We are proud that Dover achieved full-year records in revenue, earnings, EPS and free cash flow.
PERFORMANCE
COUNTS
"Our Energy platform continued its robust performance which helped offset diminished demand in the majority of our other end markets. In spite of the weakening business climate, we were able to finish strongly because of the aggressive actions our operating companies have taken during the year. Those actions included synergy capture, pricing initiatives and significant restructuring programs. For the full year, we reduced our worldwide headcount by 2,000, nearly 6% of our global workforce, and absorbed $27 million in one-time restructuring costs, which yielded $35 million of cost savings in 2008 and should yield an additional $50 million of benefit in 2009. Further actions have already been taken in the first quarter and we are fully prepared to take additional steps to address any further deterioration in end market conditions.
"In 2008 we remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We focused on synergistic add-on acquisitions, share repurchases, and selective investments in our businesses. We also increased our annual dividend for the 54 consecutive year. The result of this financial discipline is a strong balance sheet that will enable us to weather the current economic storm and provide a competitive advantage as we seek to grow our business and improve our EPS over the long term.
th
"Looking forward to 2009, we see the continuation of a weak and uncertain global business environment. With few exceptions, demand levels are down across all of our end markets. Though this downturn will have an adverse impact on revenue, we are very focused on protecting margin. The structural changes we've made to our businesses over the last few years, becoming less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater
 
recurring revenue, together with improved working capital management and strong pricing discipline, will serve us well during this downturn."
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $120.7 million or $0.65 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $48.9 million or $0.26 EPS, compared to net earnings of $185.4 million or $0.94 EPS for the same period of 2007, which included income from discontinued operations of $10.2 million or $0.05 EPS. Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 were $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS, compared to net earnings of $661.1 million or $3.26 EPS for the same period of 2007, including a loss from discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS. The fourth quarter and full year losses from discontinued operations largely reflect a loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2009, as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal tax settlements and state tax assessments.
Dover will host a webcast of its fourth quarter 2008 conference call at 8:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, January 28, 2009. The webcast can be accessed at the Dover Corporation website at The conference call will also be made available for replay on the website and additional information on Dover's fourth quarter 2008 results and its operating companies can also be found on the Company website, including an investor supplement containing a reconciliation of free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Share Repurchase Program
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $46.15 per share. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had completed the purchases of all authorized shares under its $500 million share repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Acquisitions
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company completed one add-on acquisition in the Fluid Management segment totaling $3.9 million. During 2008, Dover made a total of four add-on acquisitions, totaling $103.8 million, net of cash acquired.
Divestitures
During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company completed the sale of a line of business resulting in a $7.5 million gain recorded in the Electronic Technologies segment. There was no tax expense recorded in connection with this disposition.
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reached final settlement on certain Federal tax matters related to businesses previously discontinued and sold, which increased tax expense by approximately $15.0 million. The Company also recognized certain state tax assessments related to previously sold discontinued operations consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, resulting in additional tax expense of approximately $13.0 million, net of Federal benefit. Finally, the Company increased its loss provision for the anticipated sale of a discontinued operation by an additional $21.0 million, for which no tax benefit was recognized.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, in addition to the tax adjustments described above, the Company recorded adjustments to the carrying value of discontinued operations resulting in a net after-tax loss of approximately $74.0 million, and recorded net losses from operations of approximately $2.0 million. At year end 2008, one business remains held for sale in discontinued operations.
Growth Factors
 
 
Cash Flow
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) with cash flows from operating activities.
The full year increase in free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments in 2008. In addition, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) decreased from the prior year end by $86.0 million, or 6% to $1,275.9 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of $91.0 million, a decrease in inventory of $37.8 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $42.8 million. Excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by $56.3 million, or 4%. "Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital" as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 18.3% at December 31, 2008 from 18.9% at December 31, 2007 and inventory turns were 7.1 at December 31, 2008 compared to 6.7 at December 31, 2007.
Capitalization
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
Net debt at December 31, 2008 decreased $225.7 million as a result of cash generated from operations. The increase in long-term debt was used primarily to fund acquisitions, decrease short-term debt and repurchase shares in excess of the Company's available free cash flow. The decrease in net debt to total capitalization, after $462 million of open market share repurchases, reflects strong free cash flow and net proceeds from dispositions of $93 million.
Tax Rate
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 21.4%, compared to the prior year rate of 24.6%. The 2008 rate was favorably impacted by benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2008 had more non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions when compared to the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 26.6%.
