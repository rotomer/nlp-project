The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibits, is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of Dover's filings with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, it had earnings from continuing operations of $102.4 million or $0.55 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $169.6 million or $0.91 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, each representing a 40% decrease. Revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 12.7% over the prior year period. Dover's 19.3% decline in organic revenue was partially offset by net growth from acquisitions of 4.4% and a favorable foreign exchange impact of 2.2%.
New York, New York, January 29, 2010
Earnings from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $371.9 million or $1.99 EPS, compared to $694.8 million or $3.67 EPS in the prior year period, representing a 46% decrease. Revenue from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was $5.8 billion, down 23.7% over the prior year period representing decreases in organic revenue of 23.9% and foreign exchange of 1.7%, partially offset by a favorable impact of 1.9% in net growth from acquisitions.
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "While year-over-year comparisons remain difficult due to the global recession in 2009, I'm pleased with the way Dover performed in the fourth quarter and during the year. We had a solid fourth quarter performance as a result of continued modest recovery in several of our key end-markets, including those served by Electronic Technologies, Energy and Product Identification. Operating margins were 13.1%, and free cash flow generation was strong at $211 million for the quarter. We also closed four add-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter which will enhance our positions in energy, product identification, refrigeration and food service equipment.
"As we began 2009, we had two primary goals: we wanted to maintain double-digit operating margin and generate free cash flow in excess of 10% of revenue. We exceeded both goals. Full year operating margin was 12.3% and free cash flow was 11.8% of revenue. We also continued to position Dover for long-term growth through our pursuit of several key initiatives, most notably our global supply chain program, as well as through strategic add-on acquisitions.
 
"Looking forward, we expect full year 2010 revenue growth of 7%  9%, representing organic revenue growth of 4%  6%, plus growth of 3% from acquisitions completed in 2009. Based on this revenue assumption, we expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $2.35  $2.65. We are well-positioned in our markets, confident in our strategies and fully expect to leverage any improvements in our end-markets."
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $99.0 million or $0.53 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $3.4 million or $0.02 EPS, compared to net earnings of $120.7 million or $0.65 EPS for the same period of 2008, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $48.9 million or $0.26 EPS. Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $356.4 million or $1.91 EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS for the same period of 2008, including a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS. The fourth quarter and full year losses from discontinued operations largely reflect a loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2010.
Dover will host a webcast of its fourth quarter 2009 conference call at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Friday, January 29, 2010. The webcast can be accessed at the Dover Corporation website at The conference call will also be made available for replay on the website and additional information on Dover's fourth quarter 2009 results and its operating companies can also be found on the Company website, including an investor supplement containing a reconciliation of free cash flow and other non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Acquisitions
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company completed four add-on acquisitions. Inpro/Seal was acquired in the Fluid Management segment and Engineered Systems companies acquired Ala Cart, Inc., Barker Company and Extech Instruments. During 2009, Dover made a total of six add-on acquisitions. Consideration for these acquisitions amounted to $228.4 million, net of cash acquired. The full year diluted earnings per share impact of these 2009 acquisitions was $0.02. There was no impact on dilutive earnings per share for the fourth quarter.
Dispositions
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded adjustments to the carrying value of discontinued operations resulting in a net after-tax loss of approximately $12.0 million. At year end 2009, one business remains held for sale in discontinued operations.
Growth Factors
 
 
Cash Flow
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) with cash flows from operating activities.
The full year decrease in free cash flow reflects lower earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower tax payments in 2009. In addition, Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) decreased from the prior year end by $183.3 million, or 14.4% to $1,092.6 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of $134.4 million, a decrease in inventory of $65.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $16.4 million. Excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by $246.6 million, or 19.3%. "Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital" as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) increased to 19.9% at December 31, 2009 from 18.3% at December 31, 2008. Inventory turns were 6.2 at December 31, 2009 compared to 7.1 at December 31, 2008.
Capitalization
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
Net debt at December 31, 2009 decreased $336.1 million primarily due to lower commercial paper borrowings. The decrease in net debt reflects strong free cash flow and cash from operations which funded the Company's investment in capital expenditures and acquisitions.
Tax Rate
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 27.2%, compared to the prior year rate of 21.4%. The prior year fourth quarter rate was favorably impacted by the benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates for continuing operations for 2009 and 2008 were 24.4% and 26.6%, respectively. The full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled, and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.
