Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 25, 2010, Dover Corporation (the "Company") entered into an agreement with Robert A. Livingston, its President and Chief Executive Officer, modifying as of January 1, 2009, the interest rate credited to compensation deferred by Mr. Livingston in 1985-88 pursuant to an executive deferred income plan ("EDIP") offered to executive employees in 1984-1985. Under the original agreement entered into in 1985, interest on the amount deferred by Mr. Livingston has accrued through December 31, 2008, at a fixed rate of 12.5%, which was a competitive market interest rate at the time the program was introduced. (Mr. Livingston's deferrals plus interest credited thereon through December 31, 2008 are referred to as the "December 31, 2008 Deferred Compensation Balance.") Pursuant to the February 25, 2010 amendment, as of January 1, 2009, and for each January 1 thereafter, Mr. Livingston's December 31, 2008 Deferred Compensation Balance will be credited with interest, compounded annually, at a rate equal to Moody's Aa Corporate Bond Index published on December 31 of the preceding year or, if no rate is published on December 31 of the preceding year, the rate published on the closest date immediately preceding such December 31. The Moody's Aa Corporate Bond Index as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, was 5.54% and 5.49%.
