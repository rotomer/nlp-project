Exhibit 99.1
Downers Grove, Illinois, July 23, 2010  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, earnings from continuing operations were $171.9 million or $0.91 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $100.9 million or $0.54 diluted EPS from continuing operations in the prior year period, representing increases of 70% and 69%, respectively. Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 was $1.8 billion, an increase of 29% over the prior-year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 24%, a 4% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $293.4 million or $1.55 diluted EPS, compared to $162.0 million or $0.87 diluted EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases of 81% and 78%, respectively. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, reflecting organic growth of 15%, a 5% increase from acquisitions, and a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "I am pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Revenue growth of 29% was higher than our expectations entering the quarter and was broad-based, with Electronic Technologies, Fluid Management, Refrigeration Equipment and Product ID leading the way. We were successful in converting the revenue increases to earnings growth, as evidenced by our 16.9% segment operating margin in the quarter. Further, order rates remained strong across the majority of our portfolio in the second quarter as we exited with a book-to-bill of 1.08.
"Looking forward, the strength of our first half, coupled with our solid book-to-bill leads us to believe our full-year results will be higher than those previously communicated. We now estimate full year revenue growth will be 16%  18%, comprised of organic revenue growth of 13%  15%, and growth from acquisitions of 3%. Based on these revenue assumptions, our
 
operating companies' solid results in the first half, and our continuing strong focus on margin performance as we enter the back half of the year, we now anticipate full-year earnings per share will be in the range of $3.05  $3.25."
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $169.9 million or $0.90 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $2.0 million or $0.01 EPS, compared to net earnings of $97.1 million or $0.52 EPS for the same period of 2009, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $3.8 million or $0.02 EPS. Net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $278.0 million or $1.47 EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $15.4 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $150.5 million or $0.81 EPS for the same period of 2009, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $11.5 million or $0.06 EPS.
