Exhibit 99.1
Downers Grove, Illinois, October 22, 2010  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior-year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 25%, a 3% increase from acquisitions, and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010 were $222.8 million or $1.18 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $107.5 million or $0.58 diluted EPS from continuing operations in the prior year period, representing increases of 107% and 103%, respectively. Excluding the impact of tax benefits recognized in the quarter of $0.20, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.98, an increase of 69% over the prior year. The tax benefits of $0.20 diluted EPS were related to the favorable resolution of domestic and international tax positions and the recognition of a lower full-year tax rate.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $5.3 billion, an increase of 23% over the prior year period, reflecting organic growth of 19%, a 4% increase from acquisitions, and an insignificant impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $516.1 million or $2.73 diluted EPS, compared to $269.5 million or $1.45 diluted EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases of 92% and 88%, respectively. Excluding the impact of tax benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2010 of $0.20 diluted EPS and the impact of tax benefits of $0.15 diluted EPS recognized in the second quarter of 2009, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $2.53, an increase of 95% over the prior year period.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "I am pleased with our solid third quarter performance. Revenue growth of 26% was ahead of our expectations entering the quarter and was broad-based, with Electronic Technologies, Fluid Management, Refrigeration Equipment and Material Handling showing the highest year-over-year growth. I was also encouraged by our 17.1% segment operating margin.
 
Electronic Technologies, Fluid Management and Industrial Products all posted significant year-over-year improvements in margin. Third quarter free cash flow was $157.3 million, representing 8% of revenue, and we expect to have strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. Lastly, from a bookings perspective, order rates increased 27% over last year's third quarter, and despite the normal seasonality inherent in our business, we exited the quarter with a solid book-to-bill of 0.96.
"Looking forward, we now estimate full year revenue growth will be 20%  21%, comprised of organic revenue growth of 16.5%  17.5%, and growth from acquisitions of 3.5%. Given our strong third quarter performance, we now anticipate full-year earnings per share will be in the range of $3.50 - $3.55, inclusive of the $0.20 third quarter tax benefit. "
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $223.8 million or $1.19 diluted EPS, including a gain from discontinued operations of $1.0 million or $0.01 EPS, compared to net earnings of $106.9 million or $0.57 diluted EPS for the same period of 2009, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $0.6 million. Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $501.8 million or $2.66 diluted EPS, including a loss from discontinued operations of $14.4 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $257.4 million or $1.38 diluted EPS for the same period of 2009, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $12.1 million or $0.06 EPS.

NOTE:
Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009 were favorably impacted by discrete tax events. The third quarter of 2010 was additionally impacted by the favorable resolution of a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction. As a result, the Company's effective tax rates in the third quarter of 2010 and second quarter 2009 were 14.8% and 1.1%, respectively, which were lower than the Company's previously estimated tax rates of 29% for each of the respective periods. These lower effective tax rates contributed incremental diluted earnings per share of $0.20 in the third quarter of 2010 and $0.15 in the second quarter of 2009.
