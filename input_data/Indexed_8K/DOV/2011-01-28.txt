Exhibit 99.1
 Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 23%, a 2% increase from acquisitions, and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $191.8 million or $1.01 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $102.4 million or $0.55 diluted EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 87% and 85%, respectively. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.07 recognized in the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.94, an increase of 71% over the prior year. The tax benefits of $0.07 were principally related to the favorable resolution of domestic tax positions.
Downers Grove, Illinois, January 28, 2011
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $7.1 billion, up 24% over the prior year representing organic revenue growth of 20% and growth from acquisitions of 4%. Earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $707.9 million or $3.74 diluted EPS, compared to $371.9 million or $1.99 diluted EPS in the prior year period, representing increases of 90% and 88%, respectively. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.27 diluted EPS recognized in 2010, and the impact of tax benefits of $0.15 diluted EPS recognized in 2009, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.47, an increase of 89% over the prior year adjusted level of $1.84.
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "Dover had a strong finish to 2010 with quarterly revenue, bookings, backlog, margin and earnings all up significantly from last year. Revenue growth of 24% was above our expectations and this momentum continued to be broad-based, led by Electronic Technologies, Energy and Material Handling. Margin expansion was also broad-based, with all segments showing improvement year-over-year, resulting in a fourth quarter segment margin of 16.3%. We generated strong free cash flow during the quarter, totaling $378 million, and exited the year with strong fourth quarter order rates, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03.
 
"I am pleased with our many accomplishments in 2010. We were able to achieve full-year organic revenue growth of 20%, benefitting from improved end-markets, product innovation and geographic expansion. Full-year segment operating margins were a record 16.4%. We also generated free cash flow of $767 million in 2010, representing 11% of revenue, which funded re-investment in our businesses, our acquisition program and our 55 consecutive annual dividend increase.
th
"Looking forward, we expect full year 2011 revenue growth of 9%  11%, representing organic revenue growth of 6%  8%, plus growth from acquisitions of 3%. Based on this revenue assumption, we expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.05  $4.25."
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $198.3 million or $1.04 diluted EPS, including income from discontinued operations of $6.6 million or $0.03 diluted EPS, compared to net earnings of $99.0 million or $0.53 diluted EPS for the same period of 2009, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $3.4 million or $0.02 diluted EPS. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $700.1 million or $3.70 diluted EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $7.8 million or $0.04 diluted EPS, compared to net earnings of $356.4 million or $1.91 diluted EPS for the same period of 2009, including a loss from discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 diluted EPS.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Acquisitions
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company completed one add-on acquisition in the Fluid Management segment. During 2010, Dover made a total of six add-on acquisitions for consideration totaling $104.4 million, net of cash acquired. The full-year diluted earnings per share impact of these 2010 acquisitions was $0.02, with minimal impact during the quarter.
Further, during the fourth quarter, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors. Sound Solutions is a leading manufacturer of speakers and receivers for the cell phone market and will become part of Knowles Electronics. The purchase price is $855 million, subject to customary regulatory approvals, and the deal is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of 2011.
Effective January 3, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Harbison-Fischer, Inc., a Texas-based leading designer and manufacturer of down-hole rod pumps and related products for $402.5 million, subject to normal closing adjustments. Harbison-Fischer's 2011 revenue is expected to be approximately $160 million. The business will become part of Norris Production Solutions, which is an operating unit of Dover's Fluid Management segment.
Dispositions
In 2010, the Company completed the sale of a line of business which was reported as a discontinued operation, resulting in a loss of approximately $14.0 million.
In addition, during the third and fourth quarters of 2010, the Company reached final settlement on certain discrete tax matters related to businesses previously discontinued and sold, which resulted in tax benefits of $4.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively. These items, along with other minor expense and accrual adjustments related to disposed businesses, drove a gain on discontinued operations of $6.6 million in the fourth quarter and a full year loss of $7.8 million.
Tax Rate
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 21.4%, compared to the prior year rate of 27.2%. The 2010 rate was favorably impacted by benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates for continuing operations for 2010 and 2009 were 23.5% and 24.4%, respectively. The full year rates for 2010 and 2009 reflect the favorable impact of benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled, and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.
Revenue Growth Factors
 
Cash Flow
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) from cash flows from operating activities.
The full year increase in free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization. This was offset by an increase in Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable), which increased from the prior year end by $240.2 million, or 22% to $1,332.8 million which reflected an increase in receivables of $209.0 million, an increase in inventory of $143.2 million and an increase in accounts payable of $112.0 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $226.1 million, or 21%. "Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital" as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) decreased to 17.6% at December 31, 2010 from 19.9% at December 31, 2009 and inventory turns were 6.7 at December 31, 2010 compared to 6.2 at December 31, 2009.
Share Repurchases
During the year ended December 31, 2010, pursuant to a five-year 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2007, the Company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $51.13 per share. Approximately 6.6 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this five-year authorization as of December 31, 2010.
Capitalization
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
Net debt at December 31, 2010 decreased $424.0 million primarily as a result of cash generated from operations. The decrease in long-term debt is due to scheduled repayments, coupled with the early extinguishment of a structured non-interest bearing loan in the third quarter. The decrease in net debt to total capitalization reflects strong free cash flow from operations, which was used to fund capital additions, acquisitions and share repurchases.
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE:
Diluted earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009 were favorably impacted by discrete tax events. The third quarter of 2010 was additionally impacted by the favorable resolution of a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction. As a result, the Company's effective tax rates in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and second quarter of 2009 were 14.8%, 21.4% and 1.1%, respectively, which were lower than the Company's previously estimated tax rates of 29% for each of the respective periods. These lower effective tax rates contributed incremental diluted earnings per share of $0.20 and $0.07 in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively, and $0.15 in the second quarter of 2009.
