          The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement and in or pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in the Pricing Agreement.
          1. (a) Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made to the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities in the Pricing Agreement will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement. The Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of the Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of the Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of the Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of the Designated Securities. The Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of
 
telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

     (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such U.S. jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
     (c) To furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in New York City as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or
 
supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;
     (d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158);
     (e) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for the Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives and (ii) the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to the Designated Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives;
     (f) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Designated Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Securities Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Securities Act; and
     (g) If at any time when any of the Designated Securities remains unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, to (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Designated Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Designated Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
     6.
     (a) (i) The Company represents and agrees that, other than the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the
 
Representatives, it has not made, and will not make, any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act);
     (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Designated Securities containing customary information not inconsistent with the Final Term Sheet and conveyed to purchasers of Designated Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Designated Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or a free writing prospectus required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act; and
     (iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives (including the Final Term Sheet) is listed on Schedule II to the Pricing Agreement;
     (b) The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
     (c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document that will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
          7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent public registered accounting firm in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, any Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda or Surveys, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the reasonable
 
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda or Surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of any Trustee, and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 7, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
          8. The obligations of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) Any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus in relation to the Designated Securities shall have been filed, to the extent required, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Securities Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, and any other information or material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued, no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
     (b) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, with respect to the existence of the Company, this Agreement, the validity of the Indenture and the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and such other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
 
     (c) The General Counsel of the Company or such other counsel satisfactory to the Representatives shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth on Annex III hereto;
     (d) Baker & McKenzie LLP, counsel to the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that the statements set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations", insofar as they purport to summarize certain matters relating to U.S. federal laws, constitute fair summaries of such matters in all material respects;
     (e) On the date of this Agreement, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company, a letter, dated such date and addressed to the Underwriters, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus;
     (f) Since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, (i) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, which loss or interference is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and (ii) there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or consolidated long-term debt of the Company, except for changes in capital stock in the ordinary course of business pursuant to Company benefit plans and arrangements, and except for changes in consolidated long-term debt of the Company as a result of acquisitions since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or as a result of reclassification of long-term debt as short-term debt, or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, properties and assets, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii) is, in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act), and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;
     (h) On or after the Applicable Time, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the over the counter market; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities issued or guaranteed by the Company on any exchange or in any over the counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York state authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, if, in the judgment of the Representatives, any such event specified in this clause (iv) is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and this Agreement;
     (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses; and
     (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its agreements and obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in Sections 8(a) and 8(f) and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
          9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case
 
to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only such information so furnished is as described in Section 9(f) hereof).
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
 
(whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 9(c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who
 
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act (including, without limitation, any such broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter); and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
     (f) The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that the only information that the Underwriters have furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any thereof, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any issuer information filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any road show, consists of the statements set forth in the fifth, seventh (third and fourth sentences only), eighth and ninth (as to underwriters only) paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
          10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase the Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase the Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of the Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of the Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) above, the aggregate principal amount of
 
the Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 10(a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in Section 10(b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 10(b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
          12. If the Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by the Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
          13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any
 
Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
          14. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
          15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of the Designated Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering of the Designated Securities) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, the Underwriters are not advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
          16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, in accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
          17. This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
          18. Time shall be of the essence of the Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
          19. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of: (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; and (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; , that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or the Trustee's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).

Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.

     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of: (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; and (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; , that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or the Trustee's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).

The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

     Comparable Treasury Price" shall mean, with respect to any Redemption Date: (i) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; (ii) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; or (iii) if only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.

     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to actual or interpolated maturity (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price of such Redemption Date.
     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to Holders of Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date") pursuant to the procedures described in such notice and in conformity with the Indenture.

     The Company shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Securities, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture or the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities by virtue of any such conflicts.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions, the following terms are applicable:
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" as the term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (ii) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more Persons (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries); or (iii) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.

     "Person" has the meaning set forth in the Indenture and includes a "person" or "group" as these terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
     "Rating Agencies" means (i) each of Moody's and S&P; and (ii) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities or fails to make a rating of the Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
 
     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of: (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; and (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; , that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or the Trustee's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).

     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.

     "Comparable Treasury Price" shall mean, with respect to any Redemption Date: (i) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; (ii) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations; or (iii) if only one such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation.

provided
however
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by the Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to actual or interpolated maturity (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price of such Redemption Date.
     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Securities as described above, the Company shall be required to make an offer (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder's Securities on the terms set forth herein. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to the date of the consummation of any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall be required to mail a notice to Holders of Securities, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date") pursuant to the procedures described in such notice and in conformity with the Indenture.
     The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of the consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice.
     On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall be required, to the extent lawful: (a) to accept for payment all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (b) to deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Securities or portions of Securities properly tendered; and (c) to deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Securities properly accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities or portions of Securities being repurchased.
     The Company shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
     The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the Securities, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture or the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities by virtue of any such conflicts.
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions, the following terms are applicable:
     "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" as the term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; (ii) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to one or more Persons (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries); or (iii) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.
     "Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Event with respect to the Securities.
     "Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Company's Board of Directors who: (i) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date the Securities were issued; or (ii) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
     "Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
     "Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
     "Person" has the meaning set forth in the Indenture and includes a "person" or "group" as these terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
     "Rating Agencies" means (i) each of Moody's and S&P; and (ii) if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities or fails to make a rating of the Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
 
     "Rating Event" means the rating on the Securities is lowered by each of the Rating Agencies and the Securities are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by each of the Rating Agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies) after the earlier of: (i) the occurrence of a Change of Control; and (ii) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the Company's intention to effect a Change of Control; , that a Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's or the Trustee's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control has occurred at the time of the Rating Event).
provided, however
     "S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
     "Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
     The Securities of this series are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance and discharge at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of this Security or (ii) certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

Dover Corporation 3005 Highland Parkway, Suite 200 Downers Grove, Illinois 60515
     Re:   
Form S-3 Registration Statement (File No. 333-172299)
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Dover Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, am generally familiar with its affairs, records, documents and obligations. I have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.300% Notes due 2021 (the "Notes due 2021") and $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.375% Notes due 2041 (the "Notes due 2041" and, together with the Notes due 2021, the "2011 Securities") pursuant to a Pricing Agreement, dated as of February 16, 2011 (the "Pricing Agreement") and related Underwriting Agreement, dated as of February 16, 2011 between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Pricing Agreement (the "Underwriters"). The 2011 Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of February 8, 2001, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee" and the "Base Indenture"), as amended, and supplemented by a supplemental indenture to be entered into between the Company and the Trustee (the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
I have examined the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-172299) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), on February 16, 2011 (the "Registration Statement") and the prospectus dated February 16, 2011 (the "Base Prospectus") as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated February 16, 2011 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") and the prospectus supplement dated February 16, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), the form of Indenture and the originals or certified, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies of such records and other documents as I have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinions set forth below. In such examination, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies.
Based upon my examination described above, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Indenture has been duly authorized, the Base Indenture has been executed and delivered by the Company and when the supplemental indenture has been executed and delivered by the Company, the Indenture will constitute a valid and legally binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2. The 2011 Securities have been duly authorized and when executed and delivered by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to, and paid for by, the Underwriters, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company, and entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of New York. The foregoing opinion is also subject to: (a) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws which relate to or affect creditors' rights generally, and (b) general principles of equity, including (1) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (2) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, conscionability, good faith and fair dealing. In addition, I express no opinion with respect to whether acceleration of the 2011 Securities may affect the collectibility of any portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon.
I assume for purposes of this opinion that (i) the Trustee is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (ii) the Trustee is duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by the Indenture; (iii) the Indenture will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee and will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee in accordance with its terms; (iv) the Trustee will be in compliance, generally and with respect to acting as Trustee under the Indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations; and (v) the Trustee will have the requisite legal power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed on or about February 22, 2011, which Form 8-K will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, and the reference to my name therein and in the related Base Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, I do not thereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
