As previously disclosed, Dover Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), signed a definitive agreement in December 2010 to acquire the Sound Solutions business of NXP Semiconductors N.V. The Company has announced its expectation that the transaction would close around the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2011, subject to customary regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other normal customary closing conditions. A non-US antitrust regulatory agency has requested additional briefings in connection with its review of the transaction. As a result, the Company currently anticipates a closing no earlier than mid-second quarter of 2011, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
