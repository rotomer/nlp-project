The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including exhibits, is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of Dover's filings with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011, revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior-year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 19%, a 4% increase from acquisitions and a 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations were $183.3 million or $0.96 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), compared to $121.5 million or $0.65 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 51% and 48%, respectively. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.04 recognized in the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.92, an increase of 42% over the prior year. The tax benefits of $0.04 were principally related to the favorable resolution of domestic tax positions.
Downers Grove, Illinois, April 21, 2011
Commenting on the first quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, "Building upon the momentum of last year, 2011 is off to a great start. Revenue, earnings, bookings and backlog were all up significantly over the prior year. Revenue growth of 24% was above our expectations and largely driven by improving end-markets served by Industrial Products and a very strong energy market. Margin improved to 15.6% in the quarter, with all segments showing year-over-year improvement, absent the effect of one-time acquisition costs. We closed four acquisitions during the quarter, the largest being Harbison-Fischer, and our companies continued to record solid order rates through the first quarter resulting in a strong book-to-bill of 1.15.
"Given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect full year 2011 revenue growth of 12% - 14%, representing organic revenue growth of 9% - 11% and 3% growth from acquisitions. Based on this revenue growth assumption, the aforementioned tax benefit, and a lower effective tax rate, we expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.30 - $4.45."
 
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2011 were $194.9 million or $1.03 EPS, including a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $11.6 million or $0.06 EPS, compared to net earnings of $108.1 million or $0.58 EPS for the same period of 2010, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $13.4 million or $0.07 EPS.

DOVER CORPORATION  INVESTOR SUPPLEMENT FIRST QUARTER 2011
NOTE:
Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2011 and third and fourth quarters of 2010 were favorably impacted by discrete tax events. The third quarter of 2010 was additionally impacted by the favorable resolution of a tax position in a foreign jurisdiction. As a result, the Company's effective tax rates in the first quarter of 2011 and the third and fourth quarters of 2010 were 23.9%, 14.8% and 21.4%, respectively, which were lower than the Company's previously estimated tax rates of 27% to 29% for each of the respective periods. These lower effective tax rates contributed incremental diluted earnings per share of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2011 and $0.20 and $0.07 in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively.
