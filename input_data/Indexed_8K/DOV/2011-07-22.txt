  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 21% over the prior-year period.  The revenue increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 14%, a 4% increase from acquisitions and a 3% favorable impact from foreign exchange.  Earnings from continuing operations were $249.1 million or $1.31 diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared to $171.9 million or $0.91 EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year period, representing increases of 45% and 44%, respectively.  Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.12 recognized in the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.19, an increase of 31% over the prior year. The tax benefits of $0.12 were principally related to the favorable resolution of domestic tax positions.
Downers Grove, Illinois, July 22, 2011
 
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $4.1 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, reflecting organic growth of 16%, a 4% increase from acquisitions, and a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 were $432.4 million or $2.28 EPS, compared to $293.4 million or $1.55 EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases in both measures of 47%. Excluding the impact of tax benefits recognized in the first and second quarters of 2011 of $0.04 and $0.12 EPS, respectively, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was $2.12, an increase of 37% over the prior year period.
 
Commenting on the second quarter results, Dovers President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, I was pleased with Dovers second quarter performance, as quarterly revenue, earnings, margin, bookings and backlog all increased over the prior year. Revenue growth of 21% was largely driven by strength in our energy markets and a continued recovery in selected infrastructure markets served by Industrial Products.  Our segment margin of 17.4% was led by strong performances at Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies.  We also continued to see solid order rates across most of Dover, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.03. Lastly, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Sound Solutions, which will operate as Knowles Sound Solutions, in the beginning of July and everyone at Dover is excited to welcome them into our organization.  Knowles Sound Solutions will add nearly $200 million to our second half revenue and will be slightly dilutive for 2011, inclusive of significant early period acquisition related expenses.
 
 
 
Given our second quarter results and the addition of Knowles Sound Solutions, we now expect full-year 2011 revenue growth of 18% - 20%, representing organic revenue growth of 12% - 14% and 6% growth from acquisitions.  As a result, we are raising our full-year guidance to reflect higher volume, the aforementioned tax benefit and a slightly lower effective tax rate, net of the impact of Knowles Sound Solutions (-$0.03 to -$0.05 EPS).  We now expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.50 - $4.60.
 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $249.8 million or $1.32 diluted EPS, including a gain from discontinued operations of $0.7 million, compared to net earnings of $169.9 million or $0.90 EPS for the same period of 2010, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $2.0 million or $0.01 EPS.  Net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2011 were $444.7 million or $2.34 EPS, including a gain from discontinued operations of $12.3 million or $0.06 EPS, compared to net earnings of $278.0 million or $1.47 EPS for the same period of 2010, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $15.4 million or $0.08 EPS.
