Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011, revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior-year period.  The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 10%, a 9% increase from acquisitions and a 3% favorable impact from foreign exchange.  Earnings from continuing operations were $228.6 million, or $1.21 diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared to $219.3 million, or $1.16 EPS, in the prior-year period, representing increases in both earnings from continuing operations and EPS of 4%.  Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.01 EPS recognized in the current quarter and $0.20 EPS recognized in the third quarter of 2010, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.20, an increase of 25%.
Downers Grove, Illinois, October 21, 2011
 
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $6.1 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, reflecting organic growth of 14%, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 2% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $650.0 million, or $3.43 EPS, compared to $512.4 million, or $2.71 EPS in the prior-year period, representing increases in both earnings from continuing operations and EPS of 27%. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.17 EPS in the current year and $0.20 EPS in the prior year period, adjusted diluted EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $3.26, an increase of 30%.
 
Commenting on the third quarter results, Dovers President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, I am pleased Dover delivered strong third quarter performance driven by solid organic growth supported by acquisitions. Quarterly revenue, earnings, bookings and backlog all increased over the prior year. Revenue growth of 22% was largely driven by continued strength in our energy-related markets, our strong position in the handset market and improved results in the refrigeration equipment and Product ID markets.  Our segment margin was 16.9%, notwithstanding significant one-time costs associated with our Sound Solutions acquisition. Adjusting for these costs segment margin was 17.5%.  The majority of our businesses continued to book well during the quarter, resulting in a seasonally normal book-to-bill of 0.96.
 
We also made important progress on our strategic initiatives.  In September, we divested the Paladin and Crenlo businesses, which was an important step in our continued efforts to focus on our higher margin growth spaces.  Further supporting the success of our strategy is the recent addition of Knowles Sound Solutions, which is off to a great start and performing at the high end of our expectations.  We were also pleased to close the Oil Lift acquisition in the quarter, further bolstering our position in the artificial lift market.
 
Our third quarter results were strong and we expect most of our businesses to continue to perform well.  As a result, we are maintaining our full-year 2011 revenue growth forecast of approximately 20%, which is largely unchanged from last quarter.  This forecast represents full-year organic revenue growth of around 13% with 7% growth from acquisitions.  After adjusting our full-year guidance $0.14 EPS for the operating results of Paladin and Crenlo included in our prior forecast, we are slightly raising guidance, and now expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.45 - $4.50.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $172.3 million or $0.91 diluted EPS, including a net loss from discontinued operations of $56.3 million, or $0.30 EPS, compared to net earnings of $223.8 million, or $1.19 EPS, for the same period of 2010, which included a gain from discontinued operations of $4.5 million, or $0.02 EPS.  Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $617.0 million, or $3.26 EPS, including a net loss from discontinued operations of $33.0 million, or $0.17 EPS, compared to net earnings of $501.8 million, or $2.66 EPS for the same period of 2010, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $10.7 million or $0.06 EPS.
