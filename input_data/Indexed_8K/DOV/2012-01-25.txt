  Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of 15% over the prior-year period.  The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 6% and a 9% increase from acquisitions.  Earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $208.9 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.12, compared to $184.9 million, or $0.97 EPS, in the prior-year period, representing increases of 13% and 15%, respectively.  Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.05 EPS recognized in the current quarter and $0.07 EPS recognized in the prior-year period, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1.07, reflecting an increase of 19% over an adjusted EPS of $0.90 in the prior-year period.
Downers Grove, Illinois, January 25, 2012
 
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.0 billion, an increase of 20% over the prior year, reflecting organic growth of 11%, a 7% increase from acquisitions and a 2% impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $846.4 million, or $4.48 EPS, compared to $690.8 million, or $3.65 EPS in the prior year, representing a 23% increase in both earnings and EPS. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.22 EPS in the current year and $0.27 EPS in the prior year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.26, an increase of 26% over an adjusted EPS of $3.38 in the prior year.
 
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Dovers President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, Capped off by a solid fourth quarter, Dover delivered a record setting 2011 in terms of revenue, earnings, EPS and bookings.  Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 6% was driven by broad-based strength in energy, handsets, fluids, and industrial end-markets. Our segment margin was 16.5%, where solid performances in our Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems segments partially offset weakness in Printing & Identification and acquisition-related costs. The majority of our businesses continued to book well as we ended the year with a seasonally normal book-to-bill of 1.00.
 
In addition to our strong financial results, we accomplished several important strategic initiatives in 2011. Importantly, we realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our targeted growth markets.  We also deployed $1.4 billion in 2011 on acquisitions and divested three businesses consistent with our strategy of focusing on our growth spaces.  Lastly, we generated nearly $800 million in free cash flow, which enabled us to aggressively invest in higher growth economies and innovation, and to continue our long tradition of raising our annual dividend, now standing at 56 consecutive years.
 
Looking forward, we expect full year 2012 revenue growth of 7% - 10%, comprising organic revenue growth of 4% - 7%, plus growth from completed acquisitions of 3%. Based on this revenue assumption, we expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 - $5.00.
 
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $278.3 million, or $1.49 EPS, including net income from discontinued operations of $69.4 million, or $0.37 EPS (inclusive of a $0.34 EPS gain on the sale of a business), compared to net earnings of $198.3 million, or $1.04 EPS, for the same period of 2010, which included net income from discontinued operations of $13.4 million, or $0.07 EPS.  Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $895.2 million, or $4.74 EPS, including net income from discontinued operations of $48.9 million, or $0.26 EPS (inclusive of a $0.02 EPS net loss, primarily reflecting the sale of three businesses), compared to net earnings of $700.1 million, or $3.70 EPS for the year ended December 31, 2010, which included net income from discontinued operations of $9.4 million, or $0.05 EPS.

DOVER CORPORATION
QUARTERLY SEGMENT INFORMATION
(continued)
(unaudited)
(in thousands)
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE:
Earnings from continuing operations are adjusted by discrete and other tax items to derive adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per common share as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acquisitions
 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed two add-on acquisitions in the Engineered Systems segment.  For the full year 2011, Dover made a total of nine acquisitions for consideration totaling $1.4 billion. This included the acquisition of Harbison-Fischer within the Energy segment in the first quarter and the acquisition of Sound Solutions within the Communication Technologies segment in the third quarter.
 
Dispositions
 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company completed the sale of Heil Trailer International, resulting in an after-tax gain of $0.34 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). Fourth quarter net earnings from discontinued operations was $0.37 EPS, which includes income from the operations of Heil prior to sale as well as adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities. On a full-year basis, the Company generated a net loss on sale of $0.02 EPS, which includes the $0.35 EPS loss on the sale of Paladin and Crenlo in the third quarter and other adjustments for prior year dispositions. For the full year, net earnings from discontinued operations was $0.26 EPS, which includes income from the operations of the businesses sold in 2011 as well as adjustments to other discontinued assets and liabilities.
 
Tax Rate
 
The effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 22.3%, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter rate of 20.9%. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2011 and 2010 were 22.7% and 23.2%, respectively. The 2011 and 2010 rates were favorably impacted by discrete and other items, as shown in the reconciliation for quarterly earnings per share included herein. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the full year rates of 26.5% for 2011 and 28.8% for 2010 primarily reflect the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
 
Revenue Growth Factors
 
 
 
 
 
Free Cash Flow
 
The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) from cash flow provided by operating activities:
 
 
The full year increase in 2011 free cash flow reflects higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and lower investment in working capital, partially offset by higher tax payments in 2011. In 2011, the Company made tax payments of approximately $280 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. Free cash flow is also impacted by higher capital expenditures in 2011 necessary to fund expansion in the Companys high-growth businesses.
 
Share Repurchases
 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, pursuant to a five-year 10,000,000 share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2007, the Company purchased approximately 4.0 million shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $58.78 per share.  Approximately 2.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this five-year authorization as of December 31, 2011.
 
Capitalization
 
The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:
 
The Companys net debt to net capitalization ratio increased at December 31, 2011 primarily due to the use of cash and debt to fund acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion during the year.   In 2011, the Company also received cash proceeds of $517 million primarily from the sale of three businesses.
Total debt increased by $380 million during 2011, primarily due to net borrowings of $789 million under the 4.3% 10-year Notes due 2021 and 5.375% 30-year Notes due 2041 issued in February, part of which were used to repay $400 million of other borrowings, principally commercial paper used to repay the 6.50% 10-year Notes which came due earlier in February 2011.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Information:
 
These Investor Supplement tables contain historical financial information presented under Dovers new segment structure, as discussed within this release. These segment level disclosures are considered Non-GAAP financial information until such time that the new segment reporting structure is included within a periodic filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes this non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to better understand historical trends under the revised segment structure, which the company will be reporting under in its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2011
. 
Dover has disclosed herein non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings from continuing operations used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per common share, as management believes this information is useful to investors to better understand the companys ongoing profitability and facilitates easier comparisons of the companys profitability to prior and future periods and to its peers.  The company has also disclosed herein the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow. Management believes free cash flow is an important measure of the company's operating performance and liquidity that provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund
acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase its common stock.
