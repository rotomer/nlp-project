DOVER REVISES FULL-YEAR FORECAST
Downers Grove, Illinois, July 9, 2012
- Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) today announced that it has revised its 2012 full-year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS) forecast.
The company now expects full-year EPS to be in the range of $4.70 - $4.85, as compared to its prior guidance of $4.80 - $5.00. This new forecast represents a $0.15 cent adjustment to the high-end of the prior guidance and a $0.10 cent adjustment to the low-end. The main factors driving this revision are a broadly weaker European economy, the exchange rate impact of foreign currencies and a slightly higher tax rate. The majority of this revised forecast impact will be felt in the second quarter reflecting the above factors and the timing of orders.
Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, While some of our businesses will continue to face macroeconomic headwinds, we expect to deliver a stronger second half of the year led by our participation in the handset, refrigeration & food equipment and energy markets.
Dover will host a webcast of its second quarter 2012 conference call at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time (9:00 A.M. Central Time) on Wednesday, July 18, 2012. The webcast can be accessed at the Dover Corporation website at

The access details for the second quarter 2012 conference call will be posted on the Dover Corporation website in the coming week.
