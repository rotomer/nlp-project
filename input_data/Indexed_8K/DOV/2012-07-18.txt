Exhibit 99.1
DOVER CORPORATION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Downers Grove, Illinois,
July 18, 2012
 Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the
second
quarter ended
June 30, 2012
, revenue was
$2.2 billion
, an increase of 8% over the prior-year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 3% and a 7% increase from acquisitions, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations were
$212.9 million
, or
$1.15
diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared to
$239.2 million
, or
$1.26
EPS, in the prior-year period, representing decreases in earnings from continuing operations and EPS of 11% and 9%, respectively. Excluding $0.12 of tax benefits in the prior-year period, EPS from continuing operations increased 1% in the 2012 second quarter.
Revenue for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2012
was
$4.2 billion
, an increase of 11% over the prior-year period, reflecting organic growth of 6%, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2012
were
$409.7 million
, or
$2.20
EPS, compared to
$414.0 million
, or
$2.18
EPS in the prior-year period, representing a decrease in earnings from continuing operations of 1% and an increase in EPS of 1%. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.16 EPS in the prior-year period, adjusted diluted EPS for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2012
increased 9%.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, Our strong positions in the energy, handset and refrigeration & food equipment markets enabled us to offset significant macroeconomic headwinds, most notably a weak European economy. While our second quarter results were less than we expected, business activity remains solid in most of our businesses as evidenced by our 0.99 book-to-bill.
I was especially encouraged with increasing order rates for our new products connected with OEM handset launches. The continuation of this activity, coupled with our solid outlook for our businesses serving the oil production, downstream energy, fast moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets, give me confidence that we will be able to deliver a stronger second half of 2012.
Looking forward, we now expect full-year 2012 revenue growth of 8% - 10%, comprised of organic revenue growth of 3% - 5%, plus growth from completed acquisitions of 5%. Based on this revenue assumption, we expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $4.70 - $4.85.
Net earnings for the
second
quarter of 2012 were
$214.1 million
or
$1.15
EPS, including a net gain from discontinued operations of
$1.2 million
, compared to net earnings of
$249.8 million
, or
$1.32
EPS, for the same period of 2011, which included a gain from discontinued operations of
$10.6 million
, or
$0.06
EPS. Net earnings for the
six
months ended
June 30, 2012
were
$410.2 million
, or
$2.20
EPS, including a net gain from discontinued operations of
$0.4 million
, compared to net earnings of
$444.7 million
, or
$2.34
EPS for the same period of
2011
, which included a gain from discontinued operations of
$30.7 million
or
$0.16
EPS.
