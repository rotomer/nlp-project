DOVER CORPORATION REPORTS
THIRD
QUARTER
2012
RESULTS
Downers Grove, Illinois,
October 17, 2012
 Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the
third
quarter ended
September 30, 2012
, revenue was
$2.2 billion
, an increase of
3%
over the prior-year period. The revenue increase was driven by organic growth of 1% and a 4% increase from acquisitions, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations were
$242.2 million
, or
$1.32
diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared to
$223.4 million
, or
$1.19
EPS, in the prior-year period, representing increases in earnings from continuing operations and EPS of
8%
and
11%
, respectively, inclusive of minor tax benefits realized in both periods.
Revenue for the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2012
was
$6.4 billion
, an increase of
8%
over the prior-year period, reflecting organic growth of 4%, a 6% increase from acquisitions and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings from continuing operations for the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2012
were
$651.9 million
, or
$3.51
EPS, compared to
$637.4 million
, or
$3.37
EPS in the prior-year period, representing an increase in earnings from continuing operations of
2%
and an increase in EPS of
4%
. Excluding the impact of tax benefits of $0.03 EPS in the the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2012
and $0.17 EPS in the prior-year period, adjusted diluted EPS increased from continuing operations increased 9%.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said,
The third quarter demonstrated the strength of our businesses as we leveraged modest revenue growth with 18% segment margin and delivered $1.32 EPS. The margin performance was especially encouraging because it was broad-based, as Communication Technologies, Printing & Identification and Engineered Systems all showed significant sequential improvement, while Energy remained very strong.
While the quarter was solid and the majority of our businesses are performing very well, we are facing near-term revenue challenges in the Handset and Electronics markets, along with the continuing uncertain global economic environment.
Taking these challenges into account, we now expect full-year 2012 revenue growth of approximately 7%, comprised of organic growth of 3% (inclusive of a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange), plus growth from completed acquisitions of 4%. Based on this revenue assumption, we expect full-year diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 - $4.65.
Net earnings for the
third
quarter of 2012 were
$241.0 million
or
$1.31
EPS, including a net loss from discontinued operations of
$1.2 million
, or
$0.01
EPS, compared to net earnings of
$172.3 million
, or
$0.91
EPS, for the same period of
2011
, which included a loss from discontinued operations of
$51.2 million
, or
$0.27
EPS. Net earnings for the
nine
months ended
September 30, 2012
were
$651.2 million
, or
$3.51
EPS, including a net loss from discontinued operations of
$0.7 million
, compared to net earnings of
$617.0 million
, or
$3.26
EPS for the same period of
2011
, which included a loss from discontinued operations of
$20.5 million
or
$0.11
EPS.
