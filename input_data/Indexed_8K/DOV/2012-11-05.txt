Exhibit 99.1
DOVER ANNOUNCES $1 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND INTENTION TO DIVEST CERTAIN NON-CORE BUSINESSES
Downers Grove, Illinois, November
 
5, 2012
-
Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) announced today that its Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program, whereby Dover expects to repurchase $1 billion of its common stock over the next 12 to 18 months. The share repurchase program will be funded by cash on hand, proceeds from divestitures and free cash flow.
Dover also announced that, consistent with its long-term focus on strengthening its portfolio, it intends to divest certain non-core businesses which serve the electronic assembly and test markets. The Company will provide updates on the progress of these planned divestitures as appropriate.
 
Commenting on these initiatives, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, In addition to investments to support our organic growth and value added strategic acquisitions, Dover has consistently focused on returning capital to shareholders via a long history of dividend increases and share repurchases. I am very pleased the Board continues to support these important initiatives, which drive shareholder value creation. Our robust free cash flow generation and capital allocation discipline have allowed us to make additional repurchases of our stock at times when our share price appears undervalued, and we will continue to do so.
We also plan to divest certain businesses outside our five key growth spaces, which will allow us to continue to focus on Energy, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, Communication Components, Product Identification, and Fluids. In addition, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we expect to close a couple of opportunities before year end. Taken together, these initiatives demonstrate the conviction we have in our strategy, the long-term prospects of our five growth spaces and our commitment to creating shareholder value.
