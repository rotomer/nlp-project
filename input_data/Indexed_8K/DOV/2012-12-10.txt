Dover HOSTS ANNUAL INVESTOR DAY AND INITIATES 2013 GUIDANCE
Adjusts 2012 EPS Guidance for Discontinued Operations
Downers Grove, IL, December 10, 2012
- Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) announced that it will share its strategy and financial expectations for the next three years, including its full-year 2013 guidance, at its annual Investor Day today in New York City. The company will also provide an update to its 2012 guidance, which will include the fourth quarter impact of the Anthony acquisition as well as the impact from recently discontinued operations.
Dover is initiating guidance of $5.05 to $5.35 for full-year 2013 earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS). This EPS guidance is based on full-year organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% and acquisition growth of 4%, for full-year revenue growth of 7% to 9%.
Dover now expects full-year 2012 EPS to be $4.36 to $4.46, a $0.19 reduction from the prior forecasted range. The majority of this adjustment is related to a $0.18 reduction from discontinuing certain businesses serving the electronic assembly and test markets, as previously announced. In addition, this update includes a $0.02 reduction related to certain one-time costs associated with the recent Anthony acquisition and $0.01 of accretion from fourth quarter share repurchase activity.
The Company's annual Investor Day will begin at 1:00 pm ET and the speakers' presentations will be available live to all interested parties via webcast, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.dovercorporation.com. The presentations will also be archived on the website and will be available starting on December 11, 2012, at 12:00 pm ET.
