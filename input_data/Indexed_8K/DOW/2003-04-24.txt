Review of First Quarter Results
The Dow Chemical Company reported sales of $8.1 billion for the first quarter of 2003, compared with $6.3 billion a year ago. Earnings before interest, income taxes and minority interests (EBIT) were $344 million. Income was $85 million and earnings per share were $0.09 before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
Substantial cost reductions, improved volume and price increases combined to offset an unprecedented $1.2 billion increase in feedstock and energy costs, compared with a year ago. Reflecting the Company's commitment to an action plan outlined in January 2003, structural costs were reduced by 10 percent compared to the first quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company has made excellent progress on the other aspects of its action planincluding working capital management, capital spending control and price-volume managementand is on target to meet its objectives.
"In a quarter in which feedstock and energy prices rose more than 70 percent, and with very uncertain economic conditions, we were able to reduce costs significantly, improve volumes and raise prices, resulting in a slight profit improvement," said J. Pedro Reinhard, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Sales were up 28 percent from the first quarter of 2002, due to a 7 percent increase in volume and a 21 percent increase in price. Volume gains were achieved in many businesses and in all geographies, led by Latin America and Asia Pacific. Driven by the unparalleled increase in feedstock and energy costs, prices rose in all operating segments and geographies. The strongest price gains were in the basics segments, which had been operating with negative margins in recent periods.
Performance Plastics reported increased sales with slightly lower volume and higher prices. The change in volume was due in part to the Company's decision to exit the nylon business in mid-2002. Volume improved in Polyurethanes, Epoxies & Intermediates and Dow Automotive businesses. Performance Chemicals sales increased, with improvements in both volume and price. Emulsion Polymers, Industrial Chemicals and Oxide Derivatives posted strong volume gains. EBIT for both of these performance segments declined significantly, however, as the dramatic increase in feedstock and energy costs more than offset cost control efforts and price increases.
Agricultural Sciences had a strong quarter, delivering double-digit volume increases in many of its key products, such as those acquired in 2001 from Rohm and Haas, as well as Sentricon
Termite Colony Elimination System
, Mustang herbicide and Tracer Naturalyte Insect Control. EBIT improved substantially from first quarter of 2002, reflecting these higher volumes and cost reduction programs that have been implemented over the past year.
Plastics sales increased on higher price and flat volume. Modest volume gains in North America and Latin America were offset by declines in Asia Pacific, which had a very strong first quarter last year. Chemicals sales rose on increases in both volume and price. Ethylene glycol and vinyl chloride monomer volumes increased by more than 30 percent compared with last year, while several other products also posted double-digit volume gains. While margins for both basics segments turned positive in the quarter, they still remained well below normal levels due to extremely high feedstock and energy costs.
According to Reinhard, "This quarter's results show that a determined financial focus, with disciplined cost control efforts and price-volume management, can help to offset the impact of substantial increases in feedstock and energy costs. This concentrated approach will continue at Dow, as we aggressively manage the factors within our control. Looking to the future, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the persistently high feedstock and energy costs. Economic conditions are fragile. We are taking this one quarter at a time, and the whole organization is working very hard to earn our dividend in the second quarter of 2003."

Supplemental Information
Dow uses Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Minority Interests (EBIT) to measure the financial performance of its global business units and for reporting the results of its operating segments. This measure includes all operating items relating to the businesses. It excludes items that principally apply to the Company as a whole. EBIT for the total Company measures the aggregate performance of the business units. Dow believes EBIT is useful to help investors assess the results of Dow's business operations.
The following information summarizes the impact of unusual items in the first quarter of 2003 and 2002.
In the first quarter of 2003, earnings were impacted by an after-tax charge of $9 million related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."
In the first quarter of 2002, earnings were impacted by the following unusual items:
 - 
Additional pretax expenses of $13 million related to the Union Carbide merger.
