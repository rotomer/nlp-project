Comment
 
Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's president, chief executive officer and chairman-elect, stated:
 
"This was a tremendous quarter at the end of an outstanding year for Dow.  In 2005, we realized record sales; we achieved record earnings; we reduced net debt by more than $2.5 billion; and for the third year in a row, with institutionalized financial discipline and operational excellence, we recovered lost margin. The fact that we did so in the face of high and volatile feedstock and energy costs bears testimony to the quality of our people and the strength and consistency of our strategy."
 
Net debt equals total debt ("Notes payable" plus "Long-term debt due within one year" plus "Long-Term Debt") minus "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Marketable securities and interest-bearing deposits."

Review of Fourth Quarter Results
 
The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) reported record sales of $11.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005, a 9 percent increase compared with the same period in 2004.  Price rose 10 percent, with strong gains in all operating segments, except for Agricultural Sciences, and in most geographic areas. Volume fell marginally against a very strong fourth quarter in 2004 due in part to the lingering effects of hurricanes Rita and Katrina in the United States.
 
Net income for the quarter climbed 7 percent to $1,096 million and earnings per share were $1.12, up from $1.06 in the same period last year. Excluding unusual items in both periods, earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 20 percent from $0.85 per share in 2004 to $1.02 per share in 2005.
 
Net income for the fourth quarter included a net after-tax gain of $103 million, or $0.10 per share.  This comprised a pretax gain of $637 million on the sale by Union Carbide Corporation of its 50 percent interest in UOP LLC, pretax charges of $114 million for restructuring activities related to plant closures and asset sales, a $100 million cash donation to The Dow Chemical Company Foundation, the impact of an unfavorable tax ruling of $137 million, and an after-tax accrual of $20 million for asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 included tax valuation adjustments and an after-tax gain from the sale of the DERAKANE resins business, totaling $0.21 per share.
 
Once again in the fourth quarter, the Company maintained a sharp focus on financial discipline. Net debt was reduced by more than $800 million during the quarter, cutting Dow's net debt to capital ratio to just 29 percent by year-end, 12 percentage points lower than at the end of  2004.  The Company's gross debt to total capital ratio finished the year at 39 percent, down from 48 percent a year ago. Capital spending was held below $1.6 billion, significantly less than the rate of depreciation, without compromising the safety or the integrity of the Company's manufacturing facilities. And Selling, Administrative and Research and Development ("SARD") expenses as a percent of sales dropped to 5.7 percent for the fourth quarter, down from 5.9 percent in the same period in 2004.
 
"This was a tremendous quarter at the end of an outstanding year for Dow," said Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's president, chief executive officer and chairman-elect. "In 2005, we realized record sales; we achieved record earnings; we reduced net debt by more than $2.5 billion; and for the third year in a row, with institutionalized financial discipline and operational excellence, we recovered lost margin. The fact that we did so in the face of high and volatile feedstock and energy costs bears testimony to the quality of our people and the strength and consistency of our strategy.
 
"Our commitment to maintaining a diversified business portfolio allowed our Performance businesses to report exceptional earnings growth compared with 2004, outpacing strong gains in our Basics businesses and accounting for more than 50 percent of Dow's profits in 2005. Financial discipline also played a strong part in a successful 2005, helping reduce our net debt to capital ratio to below 30 percent and cutting SARD to a new low of 5.7 percent of sales for the year, down from 6.1 percent in 2004. And our drive to grow the Company through strategic joint ventures contributed substantially to Dow's financial performance in 2005, with our nonconsolidated affiliates adding almost a billion dollars in earnings during the year."
 
In the Performance Plastics segment, sales for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared with the same period in 2004. Price was up 10 percent while volume climbed 2 percent, bolstered in part by the successful integration of ENGAGE, NORDEL and TYRIN elastomers, businesses acquired by the Company in connection with the dissolution of the DuPont Dow Elastomers joint venture. Dow Automotive had an excellent quarter, increasing price and volume globally and underscoring the value of the Company's geographic balance, as strength in Latin America and Asia Pacific more than offset dampened demand in North America and Europe. Epoxy Products and Intermediates also had a healthy quarter, particularly in Asia Pacific where demand for electrical laminates in flat panel television displays mitigated softer volumes in other geographic areas. And Building and Construction reported solid sales growth, capturing an increased share of U.S. demand for insulation and weather barrier products. Fourth quarter EBIT for the Performance Plastics segment was $973 million, including a gain of $637 million related to the UOP sale, partly offset by restructuring charges totaling $28 million. Excluding this net gain and the gain on the sale of the DERAKANE resins business in 2004, EBIT was $364 million, an increase of 39 percent compared with $261 million in the same quarter last year.

Sales in Performance Chemicals rose to $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 7 percent compared with $1.8 billion posted in the same period last year. This improvement was driven by an 8 percent increase in price, while volume was down 1 percent from the robust levels of a year ago. Dow Latex had a strong quarter with Emulsion Polymers reporting good volume growth, driven by healthy demand from the coated paper industry in Europe and the successful start-up of the Company's second styrene-butadiene latex line at Zhangjiagang, China. Specialty Polymers reported an increase in volume compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, with particular strength in pharmaceuticals, personal care and water treatment applications. During the quarter the business also began production at its expanded FILMTECmembrane manufacturing

facility in Minneapolis, U.S.A., to meet growing demand from the water treatment industry.  Performance Chemicals reported EBIT of $177 million for the fourth quarter, which included restructuring charges totaling $14 million. Excluding these charges, EBIT was $191 million, an increase of 4 percent compared with $183 million in the same period last year.

The Agricultural Sciences segment posted quarterly sales of $729 million, 4 percent lower than the $758 million achieved in the fourth quarter of 2004. Plant Genetics and Biotechnology benefited from a marked improvement in the North American seeds and traits business, led by strong demand for HERCULEXI insect protection and NEXERA seed for NATREON canola oil. In Agricultural Chemicals, although sales benefited from solid demand for cereal herbicide mixtures and for a renewed product line of herbicides for range and pasture, overall volume was down as the business exited a number of low margin products in its on-going effort to focus resources on more profitable proprietary molecules. Fourth quarter EBIT for Agricultural Sciences was $74 million, which included restructuring charges totaling $9 million.  Excluding these charges, EBIT was $83 million, double the $41 million reported in the same period a year ago.

The Plastics segment had a solid fourth quarter, with sales climbing 9 percent from $2.9 billion in 2004 to $3.1 billion in 2005.  Price increased 10 percent compared with the same period last year, while volume was marginally lower. Polyethylene volume was down from a very strong fourth quarter in 2004, principally the result of constrained ethylene supply on the U.S. Gulf Coast caused by the hurricanes. Polyethylene volume in all other regions continued to be solid, with particular strength in Asia Pacific.  The Polystyrene business reported a healthy increase in volume compared with the same period last year, with solid demand in Asia Pacific and in Europe.  Polystyrene continued to recover margin as increased volume and lower benzene costs more than offset lower prices.  Fourth quarter EBIT for the Plastics segment of $610 million included restructuring charges totaling $12 million.  Excluding these charges, EBIT for the quarter was $622 million, 5 percent higher than the $591 million posted for the same period in 2004.
 
Fourth quarter sales in the Chemicals segment increased slightly in 2005 compared with a year ago, rising 4 percent to $1.5 billion. Price was up 13 percent, while volume was down 9 percent. Much of this reduction was attributed to the Ethylene Glycol business, which reported a significant reduction in U.S. sales due to the limited availability of ethylene caused by the hurricanes. In addition, revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 included sales of ethylene glycol sold by Dow into Asia Pacific; these sales now flow through the MEGlobal joint venture. The Chlor-Vinyl business reported a significant increase in price compared with the same period last year, essentially covering escalating natural gas prices in the United States. Chlor-Vinyl volume was down slightly, with increased demand in Europe and Latin America not quite offsetting lower volumes in North America and Asia Pacific.  The Chemicals segment reported EBIT for the fourth quarter of $269 million, including a $3 million restructuring charge.  Excluding this charge, EBIT of $272 million was 34 percent lower than $411 million for the same period a year ago.
 
Review of Results for 2005
 
Dow reported a new annual sales record of $46.3 billion in 2005, 15 percent higher than last year's previous record of $40.2 billion.  Price rose 17 percent, with substantial increases in all operating segments and all geographic areas. Volume declined 2 percent from last year's strong levels, in large part because customers reduced the inventories that they had built during 2004, but also due to the disruption caused by two major hurricanes, which temporarily reduced demand in the United States.
 
Net income was $4.5 billion, an increase of 61 percent compared with $2.8 billion in 2004.  Earnings per share were $4.62, including gains related to the sale of UOP, the sale of a 2.5 percent interest in the EQUATE joint venture and a tax benefit associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, partially offset by various restructuring charges, a cash donation to The Dow Chemical Company Foundation, a loss on the early retirement of debt, the impact of an unfavorable tax ruling and an accrual for asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. In 2004, the Company reported earnings per share of $2.93, including tax valuation adjustments, the gain from the sale of the DERAKANE resins business and the net favorable impact of restructuring. Excluding unusual items in both periods, earnings per share were $4.37 in 2005, an increase of 61 percent compared with $2.71 in 2004.
 
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Liveris said: "Our outlook for 2006 is positive, both for the chemical industry and for our company, despite the uncertainty and volatility in feedstock and energy costs. We expect that worldwide demand for
chemical and plastic products will continue to grow, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and other emerging geographies, with solid contributions from North America and Europe.  We will continue to focus on the implementation of our strategy, retaining our financial discipline and controlling the things we can control. As we have been saying for some time, we believe that 2006 will be an even better year for Dow than 2005."

Supplemental information
 
Description of Certain Items Affecting Results:
 
Fourth Quarter of 2005 and 2004
 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 were favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $637 million on the sale of Union Carbide Corporation's indirect 50 percent interest in UOP LLC, reflected in Sundry income - net and in Performance Plastics. This gain was partially offset by pretax charges totaling $114 million for restructuring activities related to several small plant closures and asset sales ($28 million in Performance Plastics, $14 million in Performance Chemicals, $9 million in Agricultural Sciences, $12 million in Plastics, $3 million in Chemicals and $48 million in Unallocated and Other). Earnings in the quarter were further reduced by: a cash donation of $100 million to The Dow Chemical Company Foundation for education and community development, reflected in Sundry income - net and in Unallocated and Other; a charge to the provision for income taxes of $137 million related to an unfavorable tax ruling on corporate owned life insurance; and an after-tax charge of $20 million related to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations."
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, earnings were favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $90 million on the sale of the DERAKANE business, reflected in the Performance Plastics segment. The Company also recorded tax benefits of $146 million related to the reversal of tax valuation allowances and the impact of a decrease in the tax rate on deferred tax liabilities.

In addition to the impacts described above for the fourth quarter of 2005, earnings for 2005 were favorably impacted by a pretax gain of $70 million related to the sale of a 2.5 percent interest in the EQUATE joint venture. Of this gain, $29 million was reflected in the Plastics segment and $41 million was reflected in the Chemicals segment. Earnings for 2005 were also favorably impacted by an after-tax benefit of $113 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA"), reflected in "Provision for income taxes." The gain was partially offset by a pretax charge of $31 million associated with the Company's early redemption of debt, reflected in Unallocated and Other.
 
In addition to the gains described above for the fourth quarter of 2004, earnings for 2004 were favorably impacted by a net pretax gain from restructuring of $20 million.
