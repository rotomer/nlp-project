On September 8, 2008, The Dow Chemical Company (the Company), as borrower, entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders, in order to partially finance the acquisition by the Company of Rohm and Haas Company (the Target) (the acquisition), to retire certain debt of the Target and to pay costs and expenses in connection therewith.
 
Under the Loan Agreement, the lenders have committed to lend to the Company an aggregate principal amount that will not exceed the sum of each of their commitments, totaling U.S.$13,000,000,000, in a single term borrowing on the date of the closing of the acquisition.  The Loan Agreement will mature on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the closing date and (b) April 14, 2010.  The Loan Agreement permits both prime rate based loans and LIBOR based loans.
 
The commitments will be subject to mandatory reduction if the aggregate amount of commitments exceeds the sum of (i) the cash consideration payable by the Company in connection with the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Ramses Acquisition Corp. (Ramses) into the Target (the acquisition consideration), (ii) all the indebtedness, including a certain credit agreement, of the Target and its subsidiaries that the Company elects to repay on the closing date (the indebtedness to be refinanced) and (iii) the costs incurred by the Company in connection with the merger of Ramses into the Target, the repayment of the indebtedness to be refinanced and the transactions under the Loan Agreement (the transaction costs).  The Loan Agreement also contains provisions relating to mandatory prepayment and reduction of commitments in certain circumstances, such as receipt by the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries of proceeds from certain sales of assets, incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money and any sale or issuance of any of equity interests or equity-linked securities, in each case subject to agreed exceptions.
 
Subject to certain conditions, the Company may at its option terminate the commitments at any time or reduce the aggregate amount of the commitments or prepay in whole or in part the principal amount of the loans together with accrued interest.
 
The Loan Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including: (a) periodic financial reporting requirements, (b) limitations on liens, (c) limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, unless the ratio of the Companys consolidated indebtedness (as defined in the Loan Agreement) to its consolidated capitalization (as defined in the Loan Agreement) is not greater than 0.65 to 1.00, (d) limitations on sale and lease-back transactions, and (e) limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  In addition, the Company has agreed to use the proceeds of the loans solely to (i) finance the acquisition consideration, (ii) repay the indebtedness to be refinanced and (iii) finance the transaction costs.  Furthermore, the Company will not permit the total leverage ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) to be greater than 4.25:1.00 when the Companys credit rating falls below certain levels or no credit ratings are available from certain rating agencies..
 
The Loan Agreement contains customary events of default.
 
From time to time, certain of the lenders provide customary commercial and investment banking services to the Company.  In addition, affiliates of certain of the lenders are providing advisory services to the Company in connection with the acquisition.
 
The Loan Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair
 
(a)           the Administrative Agent determines that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the London Interbank Offered Rate to be used in determining the interest rate applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing; or
 
(b)           the Required Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended.  If the obligations of the Banks to make Eurodollar Loans have been suspended pursuant to this Section 8.01, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.
 
Section 8.02  .  If, after the Effective Date, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Eurodollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, result in any economic or regulatory disadvantage to such Bank.  If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Eurodollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately convert in full the then outstanding principal amount of each such Eurodollar Loan to a Base

To the Banks and the Administrative Agent
Referred to Below
In care of Citibank, N.A.,
as Administrative Agent
Dear Sirs:
I have acted as counsel for The Dow Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation (the ), and I have caused to be examined the Term Loan Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2008 (the ) among the Borrower, the banks listed on Schedule 2.01 thereto, and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Borrower
Credit Agreement
 
I have caused to be examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have caused to be conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
 
Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware.
 
2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement is within the Borrowers corporate powers, has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, requires no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and does not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Borrower or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or result in the creation or imposition of any lien on any asset of the Borrower or on any material assets of its Subsidiaries.
 
3.  The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
 
4.  Except as disclosed in the Borrowers 2007 Form 10-K, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the best of my knowledge threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
 
 
2
 
materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.
 
5.  There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the best of my knowledge threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, which in any manner draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement.
 
6.  Each of the Borrowers Domestic Subsidiaries (if any) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
 
I am qualified to practice law in the State of Michigan and do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion herein concerning, the law of any jurisdiction other than the law of the State of Michigan, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States of America.
 
The opinions expressed in this letter are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, and I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion should such laws be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise.  This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter.  This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person (other than your permitted successors and assigns) without my prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,
Kenneth D. Isley
Assistant General Counsel, Corporate and
Financial Law

OPINION OF
, 2008
                        
 
To the Persons listed in Schedule A
 
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to The Dow Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation (the ) in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement dated as of September 8, 2008 (the ), among the Company and each of you.  This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) of the Agreement.
Company
Agreement
 
In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
 
(A)     
the Agreement; and
 
(B)     
the Notes executed by the Company and delivered on the date hereof.
 
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (A) through (B) are collectively referred to herein as the .
Opinion Documents
 
We have also reviewed originals or copies of such other records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and agreements and other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
 
In our review of the Opinion Documents and other documents, we have assumed:
 
(i)     
The genuineness of all signatures.
 
(ii)     
The authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us.
 
(iii)     
The conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies.
 
(iv)     
As to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in the Agreement and in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company.
 
(v)     
That each of the Opinion Documents is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms.
 
(vi)     
That:
 
 
2
 
(1)       The Company is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization;
 
(2)       The Company has full power to execute, deliver and perform and has duly executed and delivered the Opinion Documents to which it is a party;
 
(3)       The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Opinion Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not:
 
(a)    contravene its certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents;
 
(b)    except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to it; or
 
(c)    result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on it of which any addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know.
 
(4)      Except with respect to Generally Applicable Law, no authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or (to the extent the same is required under any agreement or document binding on it of which an addressee hereof has knowledge, has received notice or has reason to know) any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of any Opinion Document to which it is a party or, if any such authorization, approval, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken, given or made and is in full force and effect.
 
We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
 
 means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term Generally Applicable Law does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
Generally Applicable Law
 
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that each Opinion Document is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
 
Our opinion expressed above is subject to the following qualifications:
 
 
3
 
(A)           Our opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
 
 
(B)           Our opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
(C)           We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of indemnification provisions, or of release or exculpation provisions, contained in the Opinion Documents to the extent that enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the indemnification against or release or exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm or violations of securities laws.
 
(D)           We express no opinion with respect to Section 9.08 of the Agreement to the extent that such Section (i) contains a waiver of any objection based on inappropriate venue or in any federal court of the United States, or (ii) implies that a federal court of the United States has subject matter jurisdiction.
forum non conveniens
 
(E)           Our opinion is limited to Generally Applicable Law, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
 
A copy of this opinion letter may be delivered by any of you to any person that becomes a Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.  Any such person may rely on the opinion expressed above as if this opinion letter were addressed and delivered to such person on the date hereof.
 
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents.  This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you or a future Bank for any other purpose without our prior written consent.
 
This opinion letter speaks only as of the date hereof.  We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise you of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact, that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special New York counsel to the Administrative Agent in connection with that certain Term Loan Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2008, among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto (the ), and the Administrative Agent (the ).  Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein, but not defined herein, shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Banks
Credit Agreement
 
In connection with this opinion, we have examined executed originals or copies certified to our satisfaction of the Credit Agreement and such other agreements, documents and certificates and such other documents and papers as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinion.  We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authority of persons signing the Credit Agreement on behalf of the parties thereto, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.  As to questions of fact relevant to this opinion, we have relied upon the representations and warranties made by the Borrower in the Credit Agreement.
 
We have also assumed that, for purposes of the opinions expressed herein, (i) each party to the Credit Agreement is duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has full power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement, (ii) the execution, delivery of and performance of its obligations under the Credit Agreement by each party thereto and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (x) has been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate, partnership and/or other action on the part of such party and (y) does not contravene any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to such party, including, without limitation, the laws of the jurisdiction in which such party is organized or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court applicable to such party, (iii) each party to the Credit Agreement has duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, (iv) the execution, delivery of and performance of its obligations under the Credit Agreement by each party thereto will not conflict with or result in any breach of any agreements to which such party is a party or otherwise subject, and will not violate any provision of the organizational or other charter documents of such party, (v) all orders, consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings and registrations with, or exemptions by, all governmental or public bodies or

authorities have been obtained and remain in full force and effect for the (x) execution, delivery of and performance of the Credit Agreement by each party thereto and (y) legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability against each party to the Credit Agreement, and (vi) the Credit Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Borrower), enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
The opinion contained herein is subject to the following additional limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions:
 
(a)     
We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any assignment, exculpation, indemnification or contribution provisions in the Credit Agreement to the extent the rights to assignment, exculpation, indemnification or contribution provided for therein (x) are violative of any law, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, any securities law, rule or regulation) or public policy relating thereto or (y) are related to indemnification or contribution in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated person or the person receiving contribution.
 
(b)     
We express no opinion as to the applicability to the Credit Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 548) or Article 10 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law relating to fraudulent transfers and obligations.
 
(c)     
We wish to point out that the law of the State of New York generally imposes an obligation of good faith and reasonableness in the performance and enforcement of contracts.
 
(d)     
(i) No opinion is being expressed with respect to subject matter jurisdiction of any United States Federal Court or the enforceability of any provisions whereby a party submits to such jurisdiction and (ii) we call to your attention that federal and state courts located in New York could decline to hear a case on grounds of or any other doctrine limiting the availability of the courts in New York as a forum for the resolution of disputes not having sufficient nexus to New York and we express no opinion as to any waiver of rights to assert the applicability of doctrine or any such other doctrine.
