Number of Make-Whole Shares
 
(c) (i) The actual Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price and Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date may not be set forth on the table, in which case:
 
(A)           if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts on the table and/or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates are between two dates on the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts
 
A-12
 
and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
 
(B)           if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $70 per share (subject to adjustment as described in clause (ii) below), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock;

Each of the number of Make-Whole Shares in the table shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11.
 
(d) .  On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, or in the case of a Make-Whole Acquisition referred to in clause (i) of the definition thereof, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur or has occurred), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by overnight courier to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Company.

Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Procedure
 
(g) .  Upon a Make Whole Acquisition Conversion, the Conversion Agent shall deliver to the Holder the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, including any Make-Whole Shares required to be delivered pursuant to Section 9(a), or, in the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition in which the Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for other securities or property (including cash), the amount of securities or property (including cash) per each share of the Common Stock, including any Make-Whole Shares required to be delivered pursuant to Section 9(a), so deliverable upon conversion into which or for which each share of Common Stock is so changed or exchanged.
Delivery upon Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion
 
(h) .  If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option pursuant to this Section 9, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by it will remain outstanding until otherwise subsequently converted, but no Make-Whole Shares will be deliverable upon any such subsequent conversion.  In the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition in which the Companys Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for other securities or property (including cash), each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled, upon such subsequent conversion, to an amount per share equal to the consideration into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.
Unconverted Shares Remain Outstanding
 
(i) .  In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion the Company shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to such Holder, at the expense of the Company, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected.
Partial Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion
 
(j) .  If the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition is less than the Conversion Price, a Holder may convert each share of Convertible Preferred Stock during the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period at an adjusted Conversion Price equal to the greater of (1) the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price and (2) $17.22 (the ).  The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Convertible Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 11.  The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the
Alternative Conversion
Base Price
 
A-14
 
adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  In lieu of issuing Common Stock upon conversion in the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition where the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than the Conversion Price, the Company may, at its option, pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent) equal to the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price for each share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon conversion.
 
Section 10.  .
Conversion at the Option of the Company
 
(a) .  On or after the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, the Company shall have the right, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to cause some or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable Conversion Rate if, (i) for 20 Trading Days within any period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day preceding the date the Company delivers a Notice of Conversion at the Option of the Company, the Closing Price of the Common Stock exceeds 130% of the then-applicable Conversion Price of the Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) the Company has declared and paid, or has declared and set apart for payment, any Past Due Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock.
Company Conversion Right
 
(b) .  If the Company elects to cause less than all the shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted under clause (a) above, the Conversion Agent shall select the Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted on a pro rata basis.  If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a Holders Convertible Preferred Stock for partial conversion at the option of the Company and such Holder converts a portion of its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, both converted portions will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion at the option of the Company under this Section 10.
Partial Conversion
 
(c) .  In order to exercise the conversion right described in this Section 10, the Company shall provide notice of such conversion to each Holder (such notice, a ).

Anti-Dilution Adjustments
 
(a) Adjustments.  The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances:
 
A-15
 
(i)         the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
CR = CR x (OS / OS)
1
0
1
0
 
where,
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall be effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for the event giving rise to the adjustment.  If any such event is declared but does not occur, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors announces that such event shall not occur, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such event had not been declared.
 
(ii) the dividend, distribution or other issuance to all holders of Common Stock of (A) rights (other than pursuant to a stockholders rights plan) or warrants entitling them to purchase shares of Common Stock or (B) securities convertible into Common Stock, in either case for a period expiring 45 days or less from the date of issuance thereof, at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such issuance, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
CR = CR x (OS + X) / (OS + Y)

where,
 
 
A-16
 
For purposes of this clause (ii), in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to purchase the Common Stock at less than the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights or warrants (or convertible securities), and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be the Fair Market Value thereof.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such issuance.  In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared.  To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
 
(iii) (a) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights (other than pursuant to a stockholders rights plan) or warrants issued by it, but excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above, clause (iv) below, or Section 12), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

where,
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii)(a) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.
 
(b) However, if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to clause (iii)(a) above is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a Spin-Off) that on the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off are traded (or are traded on a when-issued basis) on any securities exchange, market or automated
 
A-17
 
quotation system, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
CR = CR x (FMV + MP) / MP

0
0
0
0
 
where,
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii)(b) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off; provided, that the Conversion Rate applicable to any conversion occurring during such five Trading Days shall be determined by applying the formula set forth above except that all references to five consecutive Trading Days shall be replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off and ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of such conversion.
 
In the event that any dividend or distribution described in clauses (iii)(a) and (b) above is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or make such distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).  No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further, that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon any Conversion Date.

When No Adjustment Required
 
(i)         Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
 
(ii)         No adjustment of the Conversion Rate need be made as a result of the issuance of, the distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plans; , , that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect on a Conversion Date, the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights or warrants issued by it) as described in

Section 11(a)(iii), subject to (x) readjustment for only that portion of such rights or warrants which expire or terminate or (y) readjustment in the event of the redemption of such rights or warrants, except that any such readjustment shall be calculated net of the aggregate value of the consideration payable in connection with any such redemption.
 
(iii)No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
  
 
(A)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan in which purchases are made at market prices on the date or dates of purchase, without discount, and whether or not the Company bears the ordinary costs of administration and operation of the plan, including brokerage commissions;
 
(B)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
 
(C)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of October 27, 2008; or
 
(D)  for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
 
(iv) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 11(a), if the Holder, as a result of holding the Convertible Preferred Stock and without having to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock, receives the cash, securities, assets, property or other benefits in such transaction on the same basis and at the same time as if such Holder held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock may then be converted.
   
 
(v) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
   
 
(vi) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11 to reduce the Conversion Rate below the then par value (if any) of the Common Stock, the Company shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price as so adjusted.
   
 
(d) .  After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 11 shall cause an adjustment to such Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments
 
(e) .  For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in
Multiple Adjustments
 
A-21
 
multiple adjustments hereunder; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 11 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.
 
(f) .  The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 11, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
Other Adjustments
 
(g) .  Whenever a Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 11, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Company makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 11(f):
Notice of Adjustments
 
(i)         compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with this Section 11 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
 
(ii)         provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate.
 
(h) .  The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same.  The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 11(g) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate.  The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Convertible Preferred Stock; and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto.  The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 11.
Conversion Agent
 
(i) .  No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock upon conversion.  In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, holders will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately
Fractional Shares

preceding the applicable Conversion Date.  In order to determine whether the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to a Holder upon the conversion of such Holder's shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will include a fractional share (in lieu of which cash would be paid hereunder), such determination shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder that are being converted on any single Conversion Date.

(2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property; or
 
(3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or reclassification of the Common Stock into other securities;
 
(each of which is referred to as a ) each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without the consent of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the ) receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest on such Exchange Property, and without any right to dividends or distribution on such Exchange Property which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates; that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof, then for the purpose of this Section 12(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).  On each Conversion Date following a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on such Conversion Date of such securities, cash or other property received per share of Common Stock, as determined in accordance with this Section 12.

The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
 
(iii) .  Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Companys by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders.  If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 13(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company.  The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 13(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
   
Notice of Special Meeting
 
(iv) .  Whenever the Company has declared and paid or declared and set aside for payment in full all Past Due Dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods).  The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly.  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 13(b).

Delivery upon Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion
 
(h) .  If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option pursuant to this Section 9, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by it will remain outstanding until otherwise subsequently converted, but no Make-Whole Shares will be deliverable upon any such subsequent conversion.  In the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition in which the Companys Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for other securities or property (including cash), each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled, upon such subsequent conversion, to an amount per share equal to the consideration into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.
Unconverted Shares Remain Outstanding
 
(i) .  In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock representing less than all the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion the Company shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to such Holder, at the expense of the Company, a certificate evidencing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected.

If the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition is less than the Conversion Price, a Holder may convert each share of Convertible Preferred Stock during the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion Period at an adjusted Conversion Price equal to the greater of (1) the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price and (2) $17.22 (the ).  The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Convertible Preferred Stock is adjusted pursuant to Section 11.  The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.  In lieu of issuing Common Stock upon conversion in the event of a Make-Whole Acquisition where the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than the

To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
 
(iii) (a) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights (other than pursuant to a stockholders rights plan) or warrants issued by it, but excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above, clause (iv) below, or Section 12), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii)(b) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off; provided, that the Conversion Rate applicable to any conversion occurring during such five Trading Days shall be determined by applying the formula set forth above except that all references to five consecutive Trading Days shall be replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off and ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of such conversion.
 
In the event that any dividend or distribution described in clauses (iii)(a) and (b) above is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or make such distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(iv) the Company makes a distribution per share of Common Stock as of any date (the ) of cash to all holders of Common Stock, and the sum (the ) of such distribution and all prior distributions of cash per share of Common Stock paid since the Issue Date exceeds the sum (the ) of the hypothetical cash distributions that would have been paid on a share of Common Stock had such distributions been paid quarterly (commencing with the first cash dividend paid since the Issue Date) and increased at a compound annual growth rate of 5.0%, compounded quarterly, from $0.42 per share as of July 30, 2008, through and including the Relevant Date, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution.  In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
(v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last day on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

In the event that the Company or any of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.
 
(b) .  All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).  No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further, that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon any Conversion Date.
Calculation of Adjustments
 
(c) .
When No Adjustment Required
 
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
   
 
(ii) No adjustment of the Conversion Rate need be made as a result of the issuance of, the distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plans; , , that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect on a Conversion Date, the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights or warrants issued by it) as described in Section 11(a)(iii), subject to (x) readjustment for only that portion of such rights or warrants which expire or terminate or (y) readjustment in the event of the redemption of such rights or warrants, except that any such readjustment shall be calculated net of the aggregate value of the consideration payable in connection with any such redemption.

(iii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
   
 
(A)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan in which purchases are made at market prices on the date or dates of purchase, without discount, and whether or not the Company bears the ordinary costs of administration and operation of the plan, including brokerage commissions;
 
(B)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
 
(C)           upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of October 27, 2008; or
 
(D)           for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
 
(iv) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 11(a), if the Holder, as a result of holding the Convertible Preferred Stock and without having to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock, receives the cash, securities, assets, property or other benefits in such transaction on the same basis and at the same time as if such Holder held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock may then be converted.
   
 
(v) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
   
 
(vi) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11 to reduce the Conversion Rate below the then par value (if any) of the Common Stock, the Company shall take any and all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price as so adjusted.
   
 
(d) .  After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 11 shall cause an adjustment to such Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments
 
(e) .  For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 11 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.
Multiple Adjustments

(f) .  The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 11, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
Other Adjustments
 
(g) .  Whenever a Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 11, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Company makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 11(f):
Notice of Adjustments
 
(i)         compute the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate in accordance with this Section 11 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the applicable Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
 
(ii)         provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Conversion Rate.
 
(h) .  The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same.  The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 11(g) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate.  The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Convertible Preferred Stock; and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto.  The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 11.
Conversion Agent
 
(i) .  No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock upon conversion.  In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, holders will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.  In order to determine whether the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to a Holder upon the conversion of such Holder's shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will include a fractional share (in lieu of which cash would be paid
Fractional Shares

hereunder), such determination shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder that are being converted on any single Conversion Date.

Adjustment for Reorganization Events
 
(a) Reorganization Events.  In the event of:
 
(1) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person pursuant to which the Common Stock is changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another person;
 
(2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property; or
 
(3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or reclassification of the Common Stock into other securities;
 
(each of which is referred to as a ) each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without the consent of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the ) receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest on such Exchange Property, and without any right to dividends or distribution on such Exchange Property which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates; that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof, then for the purpose of this Section 12(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).  On each Conversion Date following a Reorganization Event, the Conversion Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on such Conversion Date of such securities, cash or other property received per share of Common Stock, as determined in accordance with this Section 12.

(d) .  The Company (or any successor) shall, 20 days prior to the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property.  Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 12.

At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 13(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20% of the Convertible Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20% of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Companys principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next

The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
 
(iii) .  Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Companys by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders.  If the secretary of the Company does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 13(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company.  The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 13(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
   
Notice of Special Meeting
 
(iv) .  Whenever the Company has declared and paid or declared and set aside for payment in full all Past Due Dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods).  The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly.  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 13(b).

(ii) any amendment or alteration of the Companys certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Convertible Preferred Stock) to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of Convertible Preferred Stock or Senior Stock; or
   
 
(iii) any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Convertible Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, taken as a whole, as are not less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions, of the Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole, and (z) if such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock do not remain outstanding, immediately prior to or concurrent with the consummation thereof, all Past Due Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock to the date of consummation, whether or not declared, have been paid in full.
