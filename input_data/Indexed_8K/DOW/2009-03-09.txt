Dow and Rohm and Haas Reach Agreement to Close
Page 2 of 4
Dow has taken the time and steps necessary to close this transaction on substantially improved financial terms to the company, despite the continuing financial and economic uncertainty facing our world. The strategic benefits of the acquisition of Rohm and Haas have never been in question; just the path to completing the deal, said Dow Chairman and CEO, Andrew N. Liveris.
As part of todays agreement, Rohm and Haass two largest shareholders have agreed to purchase $2.5 billion in face value of perpetual preferred equity issued by Dow.  In addition, one of the shareholders, the Haas Family Trusts has agreed that at Dows option, they will make an investment in an additional $500 million of Dows equity.  These equity investments substantially reduce the debt financing required to fund the acquisition, Dow has restructured the transaction to essentially pay the equivalent of $63 per share in cash, and $15 per share in face value of preferred equity securities. To fund the acquisition of Rohm and Haas, Dow will use the proceeds from the equity issuances to reduce the amount it would otherwise be required to draw down from the $12.5 billion bridge loan, which was renegotiated last week to provide a one-year extension on $8 billion of the total loan. The financing for the acquisition also includes equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) in the form of convertible preferred equity.
Acquisition Delivers Significant Cost and Revenue Synergy Opportunities
Dow plans to achieve its long-term goals for the Rohm and Haas acquisition with a carefully conceived path forward built upon the cornerstones of financial discipline and operational excellence. Dow has put into place an even more aggressive plan to realize combined synergies of $1.3 billion, up from $910 million, as originally outlined. With a long history of operational excellence, Dow has a demonstrated willingness to make the decisions necessary to maintain and improve financial performance. Cost savings will come from increased purchasing power for raw materials for the combined company; manufacturing and supply chain work process improvements;

office consolidations and the elimination of redundant corporate overhead for shared services and governance.
Finally, as part of the Companys plans to improve its financial position, Dow has commenced an aggressive asset divestment program involving a number of Dow and Rohm and Haas business units expected to yield approximately $4 billion including:
 
 
Divestments from this program, in addition to the increased equity financing will essentially address the cash shortfall created by the failure of the K-Dow transaction to close as scheduled.
Rohm and Haas is a strong operational and strategic fit for Dow and is a critical component of the Companys long-term transformational strategy. This combination brings together the two companies best-in-class products and technologies, broad geographic reach, and well-developed channels to market. As a combined entity, we will form a world-class platform with significant long-term growth potential, said Liveris. Additionally, we are a strong company with a history of strong operating performance and a passionate commitment to our shareholders.
