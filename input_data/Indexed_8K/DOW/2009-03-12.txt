On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Change of Control (or, if later, or in the case of a Change of Control referred to in clause (i) of the definition thereof, promptly after the Company discovers that the Change of Control will occur or has occurred), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by overnight courier to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Company (which may include the records of the Transfer Agent).  Such notice shall contain the date on which the Change of Control is anticipated to be effected or, in the case of a Change of Control referred to in clause (i) of the definition thereof, the date on which the Schedule TO or other schedule, form or report referred to in such clause was filed.
Redemption on a Change of Control
 
(c) Any Holder of Convertible Preferred Stock may exercise the Holders redemption right under Section 6(a) or 6(b) by delivering to the Company at its principal office a written notice stating the Holders intention to exercise the holders redemption right and the number of the Holders shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed.  The Company shall be obligated to redeem the total number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock specified in the Holders redemption notice on or before the earlier of (i) the 30th Business Day following its receipt of the Holders notice of a redemption pursuant to Section 6(a) or (ii) the date of the Change of Control if notice is given at least 10 days prior to such Change of Control.  
 
(d) . On or at any time after March 31, 2014, the Company shall have the right to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of
Redemption at Companys Option
 
 
12
 
Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price per share of Convertible Preferred Stock for an amount in cash per share equal to (i) if the Effective Shelf Registration Date is prior to June 1, 2009, the sum of the Original Purchase Price plus all accrued and unpaid Dividends (including any Past Due Dividends) on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being redeemed through the date of redemption and (ii) if the Company has not filed an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement or the Effective Shelf Registration Date is June 1, 2009 or a later date, the greater of (x) the Original Purchase Price, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends (including any Past Due Dividends) on the shares being redeemed and (y) the Fixed Conversion Value; , , that no partial redemption of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock by the Company pursuant to this Section 6(e) shall be permitted unless the aggregate amount of the Original Purchase Price in respect of all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed equals or exceeds $50,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Original Purchase Price in respect of all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock after giving effect to the redemption equals or exceeds $50,000,000.  It is understood and agreed that the Company shall covenant for the benefit of certain of its debt holders that it will not redeem shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6(d) unless it has received proceeds from the sale of securities that have equal or greater equity-like characteristics during the 180 days prior to the date of redemption.
provided
however
 
(e) .  In the event that in connection with a conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion exceeds the amount that the Company is permitted to issue under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards without a vote of the holders of the Common Stock, then any Convertible Preferred Stock that remains outstanding following such conversion as contemplated by Section 8(c) shall be subject to redemption at the Companys option for cash (i) within 180 days of the relevant conversion date at price per share equal to the price provided in clause (x) of Section 6(e) above using the proceeds of equity securities of the Company that have equal or greater equity characteristics to the Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) thereafter, at a price per share equal to the greater of (a) the sum of the Original Purchase Price, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends (including any Past Due Dividends) on the shares being redeemed and (b) the Fixed Conversion Value using the proceeds of equity securities of the Company that have equal or greater equity characteristics to the Convertible Preferred Stock.
Redemption Following Certain Conversion Events
 
(f) . In the event the Company shall redeem shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 6(e), notice of such redemption shall be given to each Holder of Convertible Preferred Stock at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the proposed redemption date.  Each notice shall state:
Notice of Companys Redemption
 
(i)  the redemption date;
 
(ii)  the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if fewer than all the shares of a Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed;
 
(iii)  the redemption price, provided, however, that if the Company has not filed an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement or the Effective Shelf Registration Date occurs on June 1, 2009 or a later date, then the notice shall state the Original Purchase Price, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends (including any Past Due Dividends) on the
 
 
13
 
shares being redeemed, calculated pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii);
 
(iv)  the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and
 
(v)  that Dividends on the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date.
 
(g) .  In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of any redemption election by the Company pursuant to Section 6(e), the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holders, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors or any other duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable.
Partial Redemption
 
(h) .  If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof (the Trust) in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest.  The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest.  Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.
Effectiveness of Redemption
 
(i) . After the receipt by the Company of a redemption request pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b), unless and until the full redemption price for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any redemption date has been paid to the Holders requesting such redemption, (i) no dividends shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment or other distribution upon any Junior Stock, and (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be redeemed, retired, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any payment made to or available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Restrictions on Other Payments
 
(j) . Any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock redeemed in
Status of Reacquired Shares
 
 
14
 
accordance with this Certificate of Designations, or otherwise reacquired by the Company, will resume the status of authorized and unissued preferred stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.
 
(k) .  If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Change of Control Redemption option pursuant to Section 6(b), the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by it will remain outstanding until otherwise subsequently redeemed.  In the event of a Change of Control in which the Companys Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for other securities or property (including cash), the successor or acquiring corporation shall expressly assume the due and punctual observation and performance of each and every covenant and condition contained in this Certificate of Designation to be performed and observed by the Company and all the obligations and liabilities hereunder, with such modifications and adjustments as equitable and appropriate in order to place the Holders in the equivalent economic position as prior to such Change of Control.
Unredeemed Shares Remain Outstanding
 
Section 7.  
Right of the Holders to Convert.
 
(a) Each Holder shall have the right, at such Holders option, to convert all or any portion of such Holders Convertible Preferred Stock (i) at any time following ten full Trading Days after the Initial Closing Date and prior to June 1, 2009, at the Floating Conversion Rate per share of Convertible Preferred Stock (subject to the conversion procedures, and with the effect, set forth in Section 8), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as set out in Section 9(i) and (ii) in the event that the date on which the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective (the Effective Shelf Registration Date) occurs on or after June 1, 2009, at the Fixed Conversion Rate per share (subject to the conversion procedures, and with the effect, set forth in Section 8), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as set out in Section 9(i).
 
(b)           So long as the Effective Shelf Registration Date occurs prior to June 1, 2009, all of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall automatically convert at the Automatic Conversion Rate, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as set out in Section 9(i), on the date (the Automatic Conversion Date) immediately following expiration of the first full Conversion Pricing Period commencing on the Effective Shelf Registration Date (the Automatic Conversion Pricing Period), provided that a prospectus under the Investment Agreement shall have been available during the entire Automatic Conversion Pricing Period.  Effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Automatic Conversion Date, dividends shall no longer accrue or be declared on any such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding.
 
Section 8.  
Conversion Procedures and Effect of Conversion.
 
(a) .  A Holder must do each of the following in order to convert shares of Convertible Preferred Stock:
Conversion Procedure
 
(i)  complete and manually sign the conversion notice provided by the Conversion Agent, and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent;
 
(ii)  deliver a certificate or certificates representing the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted to the Conversion Agent;
 
 
15
 
(iii)  if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents;
 
(iv)  if required, pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to Section 19; and
 
(v)  if required, surrender the dividend payable in respect of such shares pursuant to the last sentence of Section 4(c).
 
The date on which a Holder complies with the procedures in this Section 8(a) with regard to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock is referred to as the Conversion Date applicable to such shares.  The Conversion Agent shall, on a Holders behalf, convert the Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by such Holder described above.
 
(b).  Effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Conversion Date applicable to any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, dividends shall no longer accrue or be declared on any such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding.  Holders who convert shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will not be entitled to, nor will the Fixed Conversion Rate or Floating Conversion Rate be adjusted for, any Past Due Dividends in respect of such shares.
Effect of Conversion
 
(c).  The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common Stock and/or cash, securities or other property issuable upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock on a Conversion Date shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Common Stock and/or securities as of the close of business on such Conversion Date.  In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock and/or cash, securities or other property (including payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid upon conversion of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares should be delivered, the Company shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Company.
Record Holder of Underlying Securities as of Conversion Date
 
(d).  Except pursuant to Section 9, no adjustment to shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted on a Conversion Date or to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion thereof shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of the Common Stock as of any date prior to the close of business
No Rights to Common Stock Prior to Conversion
on such Conversion Date.  Prior to the close of business on such Conversion Date, the shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be deemed outstanding for any purpose, and Holders shall have no rights with respect to such Common Stock or other securities (including voting rights, rights to respond to tender offers for the Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion, and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the Common Stock) by virtue of holding such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(e).  Shares of Convertible Preferred Stock converted in accordance with this Certificate of Designations, or otherwise reacquired by the
Status of Converted or Reacquired Shares
 
 
16
 
Company, will resume the status of authorized and unissued preferred stock, undesignated as to series and available for future issuance.
(f) In the event that in connection with a conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such conversion exceeds the amount that the Company is permitted to issue under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards without a vote of the holders of the Common Stock, then such number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted as may be satisfied through the issuance of the number of shares of Common Stock that complies with such listing standards and any unconverted shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions hereunder as apply during the Fixed Conversion Ratio Period (except as otherwise provided in Section 7(f) above).
Section 9.  
Anti-Dilution Adjustments.
 
(a) Adjustments.  The Fixed Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances:
 
(i)  the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
CR = CR x (OS / OS)
1
0
1
0
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) shall be effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for the event giving rise to the adjustment.  If any such event is declared but does not occur, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors announces that such event shall not occur, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such event had not been declared.
 
(ii)  the dividend, distribution or other issuance to all holders of Common Stock of
 
 
17
 
(A) rights (other than pursuant to a stockholders rights plan) or warrants entitling them to purchase shares of Common Stock or (B) securities convertible into Common Stock, in either case for a period expiring 45 days or less from the date of issuance thereof, at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date for such issuance, in which event the Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
CR = CR x (OS + X) / (OS + Y)
1
0
0
0
 
where,
 
For purposes of this clause (ii), in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to purchase the Common Stock at less than the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, there shall be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights or warrants (or convertible securities), and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be the Fair Market Value thereof.
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such issuance.  In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared.  To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
 
 
18
 
(iii)  (a) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights (other than pursuant to a stockholders rights plan) or warrants issued by it, but excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above, clause (iv) below, or Section 11), in which event the Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
CR = CR x SP / (SP  FMV)
1
0
0
0
 
where,
 
  
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii)(a) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.
 
(b) However, if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment pursuant to clause (iii)(a) above is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a Spin-Off) that on the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off are traded (or are traded on a when-issued basis) on any securities exchange, market or automated quotation system, then the Fixed Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
10000
CR
= CR
x (FMV
+ MP
) / MP
 
where,
 
 
 
19
 
 
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii)(b) shall become effective immediately after the close of business on the last Trading Day of the five consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off; provided, that the Fixed Conversion Rate applicable to any conversion occurring during such five Trading Days shall be determined by applying the formula set forth above except that all references to five consecutive Trading Days shall be replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days commencing on and including the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off and ending on and including the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of such conversion.
 
In the event that any dividend or distribution described in clauses (iii)(a) and (b) above is not so paid or made, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or make such distribution, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(iv)  the Company makes a distribution per share of Common Stock as of any date (the Relevant Date) of cash to all holders of Common Stock, and the sum (the Aggregate Dividend Amount) of such distribution and all prior distributions of cash per share of Common Stock paid since the Issue Date exceeds the sum (the  Dividend Threshold Amount ) of the hypothetical cash distributions that would have been paid on a share of Common Stock had such distributions been paid quarterly (commencing with the first cash dividend paid since the Issue Date) and increased at a compound annual growth rate of 5.0%, compounded quarterly, from $0.42 per share as of July 30, 2008, through and including the Relevant Date, in which event, the Fixed Conversion Rate will
 
 
20
 
be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
CR = CR x SP / ( SP  C+ C)
1
0
0
0
1
2
 
where,
 
The Dividend Threshold Amount and the Aggregate Dividend Amount (but not the compound annual growth rate of 5.0% compounded quarterly) shall be adjusted on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Fixed Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to this Section 9;, that no adjustment will be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount or the Aggregate Dividend Amount for any adjustment made to the Fixed Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
  provided
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution.  In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such distribution, to the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
 
(v)  the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last day on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the Expiration Date), in which event the Fixed Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
CR = CR x [(FMV + (SP x OS)] / (SP x OS)
1
0
1
1
1
0
 
 
21
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (v) shall become effective immediately prior to the open of business on the Trading Day immediately following the Expiration Date.  In the event that the Company or any of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.
 
(b) .  All adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).  No adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such adjustment that is not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further, that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon any Conversion Date.
Calculation of Adjustments
 
(c)  
When No Adjustment Required.
 
(i)   Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, the applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the
 
 
22
 
foregoing, or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
 
(ii)  No adjustment of the Conversion Rate need be made as a result of the issuance of, the distribution of separate certificates representing, the exercise or redemption of, or the termination or invalidation of, rights pursuant to any stockholder rights plans;,, that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect on a Conversion Date, the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, rights or warrants issued by it) as described in Section 9(a)(iii), subject to (x) readjustment for only that portion of such rights or warrants which expire or terminate or (y) readjustment in the event of the redemption of such rights or warrants, except that any such readjustment shall be calculated net of the aggregate value of the consideration payable in connection with any such redemption.
  provided
  however
 
(iii)  No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
 
 
(A)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in Common Stock under any plan in which purchases are made at market prices on the date or dates of purchase, without discount, and whether or not the Company bears the ordinary costs of administration and operation of the plan, including brokerage commissions;
 
(B)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase such shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
 
(C)  upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of March 1, 2009; or
 
(D)  for a change in the par value of the Common Stock.
 
(iv)  No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 9(a), if the Holder, as a result of holding the Convertible Preferred Stock and without having to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock, receives the cash, securities, assets, property or other benefits in such transaction on the same basis and at the same time as if such Holder held the full number of shares of Common Stock into which its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock may then be converted.
 
(v)  No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such
 
 
23
 
adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
 
(d)  .  After an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate under this Section 9, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Section 9 shall cause an adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments
 
(e)  .  For the avoidance of doubt, if an event occurs that would trigger an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 9 under more than one subsection hereof, such event, to the extent fully taken into account in a single adjustment, shall not result in multiple adjustments hereunder; provided, however, that if more than one subsection of this Section 9 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment.
Multiple Adjustments
 
(f)  .  The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 9, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
Other Adjustments
 
(g)  .  Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate is adjusted as provided under Section 9, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires such adjustment (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming so aware) or the date the Company makes an adjustment pursuant to Section 9(f):
Notice of Adjustments
 
(i)  compute the adjusted applicable Fixed Conversion Rate in accordance with this Section 9 and prepare and transmit to the Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth the applicable Fixed Conversion Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
 
(ii)    provide a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the applicable Fixed Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted applicable Fixed Conversion Rate.
 
(h)  .  The Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the applicable Conversion Rate or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same.  The Conversion Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9(g) and any adjustment contained therein and the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate.  The Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any
Conversion Agent
 
 
24
 
securities or property, that may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Convertible Preferred Stock; and the Conversion Agent makes no representation with respect thereto.  The Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Section 9.
 
(i) .  No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock upon conversion.  In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, holders will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.  In order to determine whether the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to a Holder upon the conversion of such Holders shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will include a fractional share (in lieu of which cash would be paid hereunder), such determination shall be based on the aggregate number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder that are being converted on any single Conversion Date.
Fractional Shares
 
 
Section 10.  
Adjustment for Reorganization Events.
 
 
(a) Reorganization Events.  In the event of:
 
(i)   any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person pursuant to which the Common Stock is changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another person;
 
(ii)  any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another person of all or substantially all the property and assets of the Company, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property; or
 
(iii)  any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) or reclassification of the Common Stock into other securities;
 
(each of which is referred to as a Reorganization Event) each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event will, without the consent of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, become convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property (the Exchange Property) receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest on such Exchange Property, and without any right to dividends or distribution on such Exchange Property which have a record date that is prior to the applicable Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a  Constituent Person ), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates;that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other
provided
 
 
25
 
property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by a Person other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof, then for the purpose of this Section 10(a), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election).

Subject to the foregoing, dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or any duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock and Parity Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in

(h) . After the receipt by the Company of a redemption request pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), unless and until the full redemption price for the shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any redemption date has been paid to the Holders requesting such redemption, (i) no dividends shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment or other distribution upon any Junior Stock, and (ii) no shares of Junior Stock shall be redeemed, retired, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any payment made to or available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

(b).
Special Voting Right
 
(i)         .  If and whenever dividends on the Perpetual Preferred Stock have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal, to at least six quarterly Dividend Periods (whether consecutive or not) (a Nonpayment), the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two, and the Holders (together with holders of any class or series of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon), shall have the right, voting separately as a single class without regard to class or series (and with voting rights allocated pro rata based on the liquidation preference of each such class or series), to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, to elect two directors of the Company to fill such newly created directorships (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships), provided that the Holders and the holders of any such other class or series shall not be entitled to elect such directors to the extent such election would cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which the Companys securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors, and further provided that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two such directors.  Each such director so elected is referred to as a Preferred Stock Director.
Voting Right
 
(ii)    .  The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Company having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon, called as provided herein.  At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 8(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20% of the Perpetual Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20% of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Companys principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any such other class or series of preferred stock for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 8(b)(iii).  The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
Election
 
(iii)    .  Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Companys by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders.  If the secretary of the Company

does not call a special meeting within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 8(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company.  The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 8(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
 
(iv)    .  Whenever the Company has declared and paid or declared and set aside for payment in full all Past Due Dividends, then the right of the Holders to elect the Preferred Stock Directors will cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods).  The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly.  Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Perpetual Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Companys authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights and entitled to vote thereon) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 8(b).

Senior Issuances; Adverse Changes
 
(i)    any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Companys certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designations creating the Perpetual Preferred Stock) or the Companys by-laws, including by way of merger, that would alter or change the voting powers, dividend rights, preferences or special rights of the Perpetual Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely (,, that to the extent that any such amendment, alteration or repeal relates solely to an increase in the amount of the authorized or issued preferred stock (other than Perpetual Preferred Stock or Senior Stock) or any securities convertible into preferred stock (other than Perpetual Preferred Stock or Senior Stock) or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock (other than Perpetual Preferred Stock or Senior Stock) or any securities convertible into Parity Stock (other than Perpetual Preferred Stock) or Junior Stock, then such amendment, alteration or repeal will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Perpetual Preferred Stock, and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance);

(iii)    any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Perpetual Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting parent entity, are converted into or exchanged for Equivalent Preference Securities, and (y) if such shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock do not remain outstanding, immediately prior to or concurrent with the consummation thereof, all Past Due Dividends on the Perpetual Preferred Stock to the date of consummation, whether or not declared, have been paid in full.
