The Company and the Selling Stockholders agree with each other and with the Underwriter and CSI that, pursuant to Section 7(b) of the certificate of designations establishing the terms of the Preferred Securities (the Certificate of Designations) and the Purchase Agreement, dated May 5, 2009, among the Company and the investors identified therein, including the Selling Stockholders (the Purchase Agreement), the Preferred Securities will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock at the Automatic Conversion

Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Certificate of Designations.  Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 15 hereof.
 
Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms amend, amendment or supplement with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

(xxxii)     The Common Stock is an actively-traded security excepted from the requirements of Rule 101 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act by subsection (c)(1) of such rule.
 
Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Underwriter and/or CSI or their respective counsel in connection with the offering of the Hedge Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to the Underwriter and/or CSI, as the case may be.

In addition, if a Potential Adjustment Event or an Extraordinary Event (each as defined in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

The parties hereto agree that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) a Disrupted Day as used in Section 5(g)(i) of the Purchase Agreement is a day on which a Dow Prospectus Unavailability Event or a Market Disruption Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) is continuing for part, but not all, of the regular trading hours on the Relevant Exchange and (ii) a day on which a Dow Prospectus Unavailability Event is continuing for all of the regular trading hours on the Relevant Exchange shall not be a Trading Day for all purposes under the Certificate of Designations.

19
 
occur, or if any of such trusts should terminate, before the delivery of the Offered Securities hereunder, book-entry credits representing the Offered Securities shall be made by the Custodian in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if such death or other event or termination had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the Custodian shall have received notice of such death or other event or termination.

supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof.

23
 
constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission.

(e)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter and CSI, on the other, from the sale of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter and CSI, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriter and CSI, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholders bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholders, the Underwriter or CSI and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), the Underwriter and CSI, respectively, shall not be required to contribute collectively any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Hedge Securities were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter or CSI, respectively, has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
(f)           The liability of each Selling Stockholder under such Selling Stockholders representations and warranties contained in Section 2(b) hereof and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the Offered Securities sold hereunder by such Selling Stockholder.  The Company and the Selling Stockholders may agree, as among themselves and without limiting the rights of the Underwriter or CSI under this
 
38
 
Agreement, as to the respective amounts of such liability for which they each shall be responsible.
 
(g)           The obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholders under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter or CSI within the meaning of the Act; and the respective obligations of the Underwriter and CSI under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Underwriter or CSI may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
8.           .  The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Selling Stockholders, of the Company or its officers, of the Underwriter and of CSI set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, CSI, any Selling Stockholder, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If the sale of the Offered Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriter or CSI set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or any Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by the Underwriter or CSI, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter and CSI on demand for all reasonable and properly documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Hedge Securities.  If the Company is required to make any payments to the Underwriter or CSI under this Section 8 because of any Selling Stockholders refusal, inability or failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the Underwriter and CSI set forth in Section 6 (except to the extent caused by the Companys failure to deliver the Offered Securities on the Closing Date), the Company shall be reimbursed on demand for all amounts so paid by such breaching Selling Stockholder.
