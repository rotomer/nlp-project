(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section VIII of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section VIII, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent, if any, that such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section VIII for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the Agents in the case of paragraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
provided
however
(d) To provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section VIII is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion so that each Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the total commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent bears to the total sales price from the sale of Notes sold to or through the Agents to
 
the date of such liability, and the Company is responsible for the balance. However, if the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the Company and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or such Agent, the parties' relative intents, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this paragraph (d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no case shall an Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commissions and underwriting discounts received by such Agent in connection with the Notes from which such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses arise and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section VIII, each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Notes under this Agreement at any time; the Company also (as to any one or more of the Agents) or any Agent (as to itself) may terminate the appointment and arrangements described in this Agreement. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Purchasing Agent shall suspend or terminate the participation of any Selected Dealer under the Master Selected Dealer Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E. Such actions may be taken, in the case of the Company, by giving prompt written notice of suspension to all of the Agents and by giving not less than 5 days' written notice of termination to the affected party and the other parties to this Agreement, or in the case of an Agent, by giving not less than 5 days' written notice of termination to the Company and except that, if at the time of termination an offer for the purchase of Notes shall have been accepted by
 
the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto shall not yet have occurred, the Company shall have the obligations provided herein with respect to such Note or Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the other parties in writing of any such termination.
The Purchasing Agent may, and, upon the request of an Agent with respect to any Notes being purchased by such Agent shall, terminate any agreement hereunder by the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes, immediately upon notice to the Company at any time prior to the Settlement Date relating thereto, (i) if there has been, since the date of such agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto since the date of the applicable agreement), any change, or any development involving an impending prospective change, in or affecting the business, financial position or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto since the date of the applicable agreement), or (ii) if there shall have occurred, since the date of such agreement, any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, financial or otherwise, the effect of which is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Purchasing Agent or such Agent, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, or (iii) if, since the date of such agreement, trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, (iv) if there shall have come to the Purchasing Agent's or such Agent's attention any facts that would cause the Purchasing Agent or such Agent to believe that the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading, (v) if there has been, since the date of such agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto since the date of the applicable agreement), a downgrading in the rating assigned to the Notes or any of the Company's other debt securities by Moody's or S&P, and either such organizations have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review its rating of the Notes or any of the Company's other debt securities or (vi) if, since the date of such agreement, a banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Any Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination in your absolute discretion on the terms set forth or incorporated by reference therein. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement.
 
If this Agreement is terminated, Section III(c) and (e), Section VIII and Section XII hereof shall survive and shall remain in effect; provided that if at the time of termination of this Agreement an offer to purchase Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of all of Section III, Section IV(b) and Section V shall also survive until time of delivery.
In the event a proposed offering is not completed according to the terms of this Agreement, an Agent will be reimbursed by the Company only for out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred.
Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Agent shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered in person or sent by telex, facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing), or registered mail to such Agent at its address, telex or facsimile number set forth on Annex A hereto and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by telex, facsimile transmission (confirmed in writing) or registered mail to the Company at the address specified below. All such notices shall be effective on receipt.

InterNotes, due from six months or more from date of issue are offered on a continuing basis by The Dow Chemical Company (the "Company"). The Notes will be offered by Incapital LLC (the "Purchasing Agent"), Banc of America Securities LLC, Charles Schwab & Company, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, (collectively, the "Agents") pursuant to a Selling Agent Agreement among the Company and the Agents dated as of the date hereof (the "Selling Agent Agreement") and one or more terms agreements substantially in the form attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit C (each a "Terms Agreement"). The Notes are being resold by the Purchasing Agent (and by any Agent that purchases them from the Purchasing Agent) (i) directly to customers of the Agents or (ii) to selected broker-dealers (the "Selected Dealers") for distribution to their customers pursuant to a Master Selected Dealer Agreement (a "Dealers Agreement") attached to the Selling Agent Agreement as Exhibit E. The Agents have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes. The Notes have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., is the trustee (the "Trustee") for the debt under the indenture, dated as of May 1, 2008 (the "Indenture") covering the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. also will serve as authenticating agent, issuing agent and paying agent.
Each tranche of Notes will be issued in book-entry only form ("Notes") and represented by one or more fully registered global notes without coupons (each, a "Global Note") held by the Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Corporation ("DTC") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC. Each Global Note will have the annual interest rate, maturity and other terms set forth in the relevant Pricing Supplement (as defined in the Selling Agent Agreement). Owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be entitled to physical delivery of Notes issued in certificated form equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only upon certain limited circumstances described in the Indenture.
Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Company by its Treasury Department. The Company will advise the Agents and the Trustee in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents and the Trustee are to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.
Notes will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in herein. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with or omit certain of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Selling Agent Agreement or the Prospectus and the Pricing Supplement (together, the "Prospectus"), the relevant provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Selling Agent Agreement and the Prospectus shall control. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Selling Agent Agreement, the Prospectus in the form most recently filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act, or in the Indenture.
 
In connection with the qualification of Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC, dated April 25, 2003 and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC (the "Certificate Agreement") dated May 26, 1989 and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS"). The procedures set forth below may be modified in compliance with DTC's then-applicable procedures and upon agreement by the Company, the Trustee and the Purchasing Agent.

Dear Selected Dealer:
In connection with public offerings of securities after the date hereof for which we are acting as manager of an underwriting syndicate or are otherwise responsible for the distribution of securities to the public by means of an offering of securities for sale to selected dealers, you may be offered the right as such a selected dealer to purchase as principal a portion of such securities. This will confirm our mutual agreement as to the general terms and conditions applicable to your participation in any such selected dealer group organized by us as follows.
1. . The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to any public offering of securities ("Securities"), pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or exempt from registration thereunder (other than a public offering of Securities effected wholly outside the United States of America), wherein Incapital LLC clearing through BNY Clearing Services, LLC (the "Account") (acting for its own Account or for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate) is responsible for managing or otherwise implementing the sale of the Securities to selected dealers ("Selected Dealers") and has expressly informed you that such terms and conditions shall be applicable. Any such offering of Securities to you as a Selected Dealer is hereinafter called an "Offering". In the case of any Offering where we are acting for the account of any underwriting or similar group or syndicate ("Underwriters"), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and binding upon, such Underwriters, including, in the case of any Offering where we are acting with others as representatives of Underwriters, such other representatives. The use of the defined term Underwriter shall be understood to include acting as agent.
Applicability of this Agreement
2. . Any Offering: (i) will be subject to delivery of the Securities and their acceptance by us and any other Underwriters; (ii) may be subject to the approval of all legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of other conditions, and (iii) may be made on the basis of reservation of Securities or an allotment against subscription. We will advise you by electronic mail, facsimile or other form of Written Communication (as defined below) of the particular method and supplementary terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the information as to prices and offering date referred to in Section 3(c) hereof) of any Offering in which you are invited to participate. "Written Communication" may include, in the case of any Offering described in Section 3(a) hereof, Additional Information (as defined below) and, in the case of any Offering described in Section
Conditions of Offering; Acceptance and Purchases
 
or 3(b) hereof, an offering circular) You agree that if we make electronic delivery of a prospectus or an offering circular or any supplement thereto, we have satisfied our obligation, if any, pursuant to Section 3 hereof to deliver to you a prospectus or an offering circular or any supplement thereto. To the extent such supplementary terms and conditions are inconsistent with any provision herein, such terms and conditions shall supersede any such provision. Unless otherwise indicated in any such Written Communication, acceptances and other communications by you with respect to an Offering should be sent to Incapital LLC, One North LaSalle Street, Suite 3500, Chicago, IL 60602, (Fax: (312) 379-3701). We reserve the right to reject any acceptance in whole or in part. Unless notified otherwise by us, Securities purchased by you shall be paid for on such date as we shall determine, on one day's prior notice to you, by electronic transfer in an amount equal to the Public Offering Prices (as hereinafter defined) or, if we shall so advise you, at such Public Offering Price less the Concession (as hereinafter defined), payable in Federal funds to the order of RBC Dain Correspondent Services clearing for the account of Incapital LLC, against delivery of the Securities. If Securities are purchased and paid for at such Public Offering Price, such Concession will be paid after the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to such Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless notified otherwise by us, payment for and delivery of Securities purchased by you shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, if you are a member, unless you have otherwise notified us prior to the date specified in a Written Communication to you from us or, if you are not a member, settlement may be made through a correspondent who is a member pursuant to instructions which you will send to us prior to such specified date.
3. .
Offering Materials and Arrangements
(a) Registered Offerings. In the case of any Offering of Securities that are registered under the Securities Act ("Registered Offering"), the following terms shall have the following meanings. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means any preliminary prospectus relating to the Offering or any preliminary prospectus supplement together with a prospectus relating to the Offering. The term "Prospectus" means the prospectus, together with the final prospectus supplement, if any, relating to the Offering filed or to be filed under Rule 424 of the Securities Act. The term "free writing prospectus" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and the term "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus" means (i) a free writing prospectus authorized for use by us and the issuer in connection with the Offering of the Securities that has been or will be filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or (ii) a free writing prospectus containing solely a description of terms of the Securities that (a) does not reflect the final terms, (b) is exempt from the filing requirement pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) and (c) is furnished to you by Incapital LLC. "Additional Information" means the Preliminary Prospectus together with each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, if any, delivered to you relating to the Offering of Securities. In connection with any Registered Offering, we will provide to you electronically copies of the Additional Information and of the Prospectus (other than in each case information incorporated by reference therein) for the purposes contemplated by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission) thereunder and will make available to you such number of copies of the Prospectus as you may reasonably request as soon as practicable after sufficient copies are made available to us by the issuer of the Securities.
 
You agree that you will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of any written communication (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) concerning the Offering, any issuer of the Securities, (including, without limitation, any free writing prospectus and any information furnished by us and any issuer of Securities but not incorporated by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus) other than (a) any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus or (b) any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.
You represent and warrant that you are familiar with the rules relating to the distribution of a Preliminary Prospectus and agree that you will comply therewith. You agree to make a record of your distribution of each Preliminary Prospectus and, when furnished with copies of any revised Preliminary Prospectus, you will, upon our request, promptly forward copies thereof to each person to whom you have theretofore distributed a Preliminary Prospectus.
You agree that in purchasing Securities in a Registered Offering you will rely upon no statement whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the Preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus delivered to you by us. You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to a prospectus or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the prospectus in connection with the sale of such Securities.
(b) . In the case of any Offering of Securities, other than a Registered Offering, which is made pursuant to an offering circular or other document comparable to a prospectus in a Registered Offering, we shall provide to you electronic copies of each preliminary offering circular, if any, any offering circular supplement and of the final offering circular relating thereto and will make available to you such number of copies of the final offering circular as you may reasonably request as soon as practicable after sufficient copies are made available to us by the issuer of the Securities. You agree that you will comply with the applicable Federal and state laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of any regulatory body promulgated thereunder, governing the use and distribution of offering circulars by brokers or dealers. You agree that in purchasing Securities pursuant to an offering circular you will rely upon no statements whatsoever, written or oral, other than the statements in the preliminary or final offering circular delivered to you by us. You will not be authorized by the issuer or other seller of Securities offered pursuant to an offering circular or by any Underwriter to give any information or to make any representation not contained in the offering circular in connection with the sale of such Securities.
Offerings Pursuant to Offering Circular
(c) . With respect to any Offering of Securities, we will inform you by a Written Communication of the public offering price, the selling concession, the reallowance (if any) to dealers and the time when you may commence selling Securities to the public. After such public offering has commenced, we may change the public offering price, the selling concession and the reallowance to dealers. The offering price, selling concession and reallowance (if any) to dealers at any time in effect with respect to an Offering are hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the "Public Offering Price", the "Concession" and the "Reallowance". With respect to each Offering of Securities, until the provisions of this Section 3(c) shall be terminated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, you agree to offer Securities to the public at no more than the Public Offering Price. If so notified by us, you may sell Securities to the public at a lesser negotiated price than the Public Offering Price, but in an amount not to exceed
Offer and Sale to the Public
 
the "Concession." If a Reallowance is in effect, a reallowance from the Public Offering Price not in excess of such Reallowance may be allowed as consideration for services rendered in distribution to dealers who are actually engaged in the investment banking or securities business, who are either (i) members in good standing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") (former the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD")) who agree to abide by the applicable rules of FINRA (see Section 4(a) below) or (ii) foreign banks, dealers or institutions not eligible for membership in FINRA who represent to you that they will promptly reoffer such Securities at the Public Offering Price and will abide by the conditions with respect to foreign banks, dealers and institutions set forth in Section 4(a) hereof.
(d) . We may, with respect to any Offering, be authorized to over-allot in arranging sales to Selected Dealers, to purchase and sell Securities for long or short account and to stabilize or maintain the market price of the Securities. You agree that, upon our request at any time and from time to time prior to the termination of the provisions of Section 3(c) hereof with respect to any Offering, you will report to us the amount of Securities purchased by you pursuant to such Offering which then remain unsold by you and will, upon our request at any such time, sell to us for our account or the account of one or more Underwriters such amount of such unsold Securities as we may designate at the Public Offering Price less an amount to be determined by us not in excess of the Concession.

This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
1. . This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities (herein called the "Securities") of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 1, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series may bear different dates, mature at different times and bear interest at different rates. The Securities of this series may be issued from time to time in an unlimited aggregate principal amount.
General
2. . Unless a Redemption Right is specified on the face hereof, this Security shall not be redeemable at the option of the Company before the Maturity Date specified on the face hereof. If a Redemption Right is so specified, this Security may be redeemed at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date on and after the date, if any, specified on the face hereof (each, a "Redemption Date"). This Security may be redeemed on any Redemption Date in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 (an "Authorized Denomination") at the option of the Company at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, on written notice given not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days prior to the proposed Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security for the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the surrender hereof.
Redemption at the Option of the Company
3. . Unless a Repayment Right is specified on the face hereof, this Security shall not be repayable at the option of the Holder on any date prior to the Maturity Date specified on the face hereof, other than in connection with any applicable Survivor's Option (defined below). If a Repayment Right is so specified, this Security is subject to repayment at the option of the Holder on any Interest Payment Date on and after the date, if any, indicated on the face hereof (each, a "Repayment Date"). On any Repayment Date this Security shall be repayable in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 at the option of the Holder hereof at a repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, together with accrued interest thereon to the Repayment Date. In order for a Security to be repaid in whole or in part at the option of the Holder, the Trustee must receive, at the Corporate Trust Office, or such other office of which the Company shall from time to time notify the holders of the Securities, at least 30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Repayment Date on which this Security is to be repaid, this Security with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" below duly completed. Once this Security is delivered for repayment, the Holder may not revoke its exercise of the repayment option.
Repayment at the Option of the Holder
4. . If the Survivor's Option is affirmatively specified on the face hereof, the Holder of the Security shall have the right to require the Company to repay a Security prior to its maturity date upon the death of the beneficial owner of the Security as described below. The Company calls this right the "Survivor's Option."
Repayment Upon Death
 
Upon exercise of the Survivor's Option, the Company will, at its option, either repay or repurchase any Security (or portion thereof) properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the person (the "Representative") that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner of the Security at a price equal to the sum of:
 
 
subject to the following limitations.
The Survivor's Option may not be exercised unless the Security was owned by the beneficial owner or the estate of that beneficial owner at least six months prior to such exercise.In addition, the Company may limit the aggregate principal amount of Securities as to which the Survivor's Option may be exercised as follows:
 
 
The Company will not make principal repayments pursuant to the exercise of the Survivor's Option except in principal amounts of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000. If the limitations described above would result in the partial repayment of any Security, the principal amount of the Security remaining outstanding after repayment must be at least $1,000.
An otherwise valid election to exercise the Survivor's Option may not be withdrawn. Each Security (or portion thereof) tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivor's Option will be accepted in the order all such Securities are received by the Trustee, unless the acceptance of that Security would contravene the annual put limitation or the individual put limitation. If, as of the end of any calendar year, the aggregate principal amount of Securities (or portions thereof) that have been tendered pursuant to the valid exercise of the Survivor's Option during that year has exceeded either the annual put limitation or the individual put limitation for that year, any exercise(s) of the Survivor's Option with respect to Securities (or portions thereof) not accepted during such calendar year because such acceptance would have contravened either such limitation shall be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year in the order all such Securities (or portions thereof) were originally tendered.
Any Security (or portion thereof) accepted for repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option will be repaid or repurchased on the first Interest Payment Date to occur at least 20 calendar days after the date of acceptance. If that date is not a Business Day,
 
payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that a Security (or any portion thereof) tendered for repayment or repurchase pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivor's Option is not accepted, the Trustee will deliver a notice by first-class mail to the registered Holder, at that Holder's last known address as indicated in the Security register, that states the reason that the Security (or portion thereof) has not been accepted for repayment.
Subject to the foregoing, in order to validly exercise a Survivor's Option, the Trustee must receive from the representative of the deceased beneficial owner:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the annual put limitation and the individual put limitation, all questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivor's Option will be determined by the Trustee in its sole discretion. The Trustee's determination will be final and binding on all parties.
The death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a Security as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with another person, or as a tenant in common with the deceased Holder's spouse, will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of the Security, and the entire principal amount of the Security so held will be subject to the Survivor's Option. The death of a person holding a beneficial interest in a Security as a tenant in common with a person other than such deceased Holder's spouse will be deemed the death of the beneficial owner of a Security only with respect to the deceased Holder's interest in the Security. The death of a person who, during his or her lifetime, was entitled to substantially all of the beneficial interests of ownership of a Security will
 
be deemed the death of the beneficial owner for purposes of the Survivor's Option, regardless of the registered Holder of the Security, if such beneficial interest can be established to the satisfaction of the Trustee. Such beneficial interest will be deemed to exist in typical cases of nominee ownership, ownership under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, community property or other joint ownership arrangements between a husband and wife and custodial and trust arrangements where one person has substantially all of the beneficial ownership interest in the Security during his or her lifetime.
For Securities represented by a Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee shall be the holder of such Security and therefore shall be the only entity that can exercise the Survivor's Option for such Security. To obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option with respect to such Security, the Representative must provide to the broker or other entity through which the beneficial interest in such Security is held by the deceased beneficial owner (i) the documents described in the third preceding paragraph and (ii) written instructions to such broker or other entity to notify the Depositary of such Representative's desire to obtain repayment or repurchase pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option. Such broker or other entity shall provide to the Trustee (i) the documents received from the Representative referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence and (ii) a certificate satisfactory to the Trustee from such broker or other entity stating that it represents the deceased beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity shall be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives pursuant to exercise of the Survivor's Option to the appropriate Representative.
5. . If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Events of Default
6. . The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
Modifications and Waivers; Obligation of the Company Absolute
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
7. . The Securities are issuable in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and to the limitations described below, if applicable, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
Authorized Denominations
 
8. . As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security register upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the City of Chicago, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the securities registrar (which shall initially be the Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., Two North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602 (Attention: Corporate Trust Department) or at such other address as it may designate as its principal corporate trust office in the City of Chicago), duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
Registration of Transfer
This Security is exchangeable only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for certificated Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent Security to be exchanged, and provided further that, unless the Company agrees otherwise, Securities of this series in certificated registered form will be issued in exchange for this permanent Security, or any portion hereof, only if such Securities in certificated registered form were requested by written notice to the Trustee or the Securities Registrar by or on behalf of a person who is beneficial owner of an interest hereof given through the Holder hereof. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this permanent Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in certificated registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
9. . Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Dow Chemical Company

Midland, Michigan 48674
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Associate General CounselCorporate Transactions of The Dow Chemical Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and I have supervised the legal and corporate proceedings of the Company relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of its Dow InterNotes (the "Securities"), pursuant to the Indenture dated as of May 1, 2008 (the "Indenture"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee (the "Trustee").
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have supervised the examination of the following:
(i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and all amendments thereto;
(ii) the Bylaws of the Company and all amendments thereto;
(iii) the Indenture; and
(iv) the selling agent agreement, dated February 19, 2010, among the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC, Incapital LLC, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as agents (the "Selling Agent Agreement").
I have also supervised the examination of originals or certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company and such other documents, corporate records, certificates of public authorities, and other documents and instruments as I have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering the opinions hereinafter expressed. In such examination, I have assumed (i) the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Selling Agent Agreement and the Indenture by all parties thereto other than the Company, (ii) the genuineness of all signatures (other than signatures on behalf of the Company), (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted as originals and the conformity to originals of documents submitted as copies, and (iv) the legal capacity of all natural persons, other than persons signing on behalf of the Company, executing the Selling Agent Agreement and the Indenture. As to various questions of fact that are material to the opinions hereinafter expressed, I have, when such facts were not independently established by me or members of the legal staff reporting to me, relied upon the representations and certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials.
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigations as I have deemed necessary, and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, it is my opinion that:
(i) the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
