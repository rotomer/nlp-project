Comment
Andrew N. Liveris, Dow's chairman and chief executive officer, stated:
Dow delivered broad-based sales gains and significant earnings growth this quarter, reflecting the strength of our transformed business portfolio. Our diversified geographic presence was also on display, as our investments in emerging regions enabled us to capitalize on growth where it is happening most rapidly, even as developed regions paused in their economic recovery.
We achieved record EBITDA for both the quarter and year to date. This performance demonstrates that our strategy is delivering results, as we commercialize our R&D pipeline, strengthen our balanced and integrated portfolio, build upon our formidable feedstock advantage, and drive efficiencies throughout our business to deliver earnings growth.
This quarter shows clearly that Dow has the agility and flexibility to respond to rapidly changing economic conditions. We took actions again this quarter to provide near-term flexibility in anticipation of volatile economic environments, while also continuing to invest for long-term growth. We are operating from a position of financial strength. Dow is an enterprise that is built for times like these - and is built to grow.
Review of Third Quarter Results
The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) reported sales of $15.1 billion, a 17 percent increase compared with the same period last year, with top-line growth driven by price. Double-digit sales gains were reported in all operating segments, with the largest percentage increases in Feedstocks and Energy (34 percent) and Agricultural Sciences (27 percent). Double-digit sales increases were also reported in all geographic areas, with the largest growth in Latin America (21 percent) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (19 percent). In emerging geographies, sales reached $5 billion, a new quarterly record for the Company.
Price rose 17 percent at the Company level. Broad-based price gains were achieved in all geographic areas, led by EMEA (21 percent) and North America (17 percent). Double-digit price gains were reported in all operating segments, except Electronic and Functional Materials (up 8 percent) and Agricultural Sciences (up 9 percent). Price gains offset a $1.7 billion increase in purchased feedstock and energy costs.
At the Company level, volume was flat versus the same quarter last year, as demand gains in Latin America (7 percent) and Asia Pacific (5 percent) offset decreases in North America (3 percent) and EMEA (2 percent). Volume growth in emerging geographies was 7 percent, led by China (12 percent), India (11 percent) and Brazil (10 percent). Across operating segments volume gains were reported in Agricultural Sciences (18 percent), Electronic and Functional Materials (3 percent) and Performance Plastics (1 percent).
Dow delivered $2.1 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA excluding certain items was $2.0 billion, representing the highest third quarter result in the Company's history. Electronic and Functional Materials achieved a new quarterly EBITDA record. EBITDA for the first nine months of the year was $6.4 billion. Year-to-date EBITDA performance of $6.8 billion excluding certain items represents a record and a 21 percent increase year-over-year.
Reported earnings for the current quarter were $0.69 per share, compared with reported earnings of $0.45 per share in the same period last year. The Company delivered $0.62 per share excluding certain items, compared with $0.54 per share on the same basis in the year-ago period. Certain items in the current quarter consisted of a pretax $86 million gain related to cash collected on a previously impaired note receivable related to Equipolymers, a nonconsolidated affiliate. The gain is shown as "Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated statements of income and reflected in Performance Plastics. (See Supplemental Information at the end of the release for a description of certain items affecting results in all periods presented.)
Dow's global operating rate was 83 percent, down 3 percentage points from the year-ago period. Sequentially, the Company's operating rate decreased 1 percentage point.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were up 8 percent versus the year-ago period, driven in part by increased spending in Agricultural Sciences in support of product launches and growth initiatives.
Research and Development (R&D) expenses were flat with the year-ago period. The Company continued to preferentially invest in its technology pipeline, most notably in Agricultural Sciences and Electronic and Functional Materials, each with a double-digit increase in R&D investment.
Equity earnings were $375 million on a reported basis. Equity earnings were $289 million excluding certain items, which represents a 15 percent increase. Dow has achieved $964 million of equity earnings, or $878 million excluding certain items through the third quarter, representing a year-to-date record.
The Company continued to make solid progress in deleveraging its balance sheet, reducing debt by nearly $500 million in the third quarter of 2011. As a result, net debt to total capitalization fell to 40.9 percent. Year to date Dow has reduced debt by $4.2 billion.
The Company continued to surpass its growth synergy targets, delivering $1.7 billion in sales on an annual run-rate basis. Sequentially, the Company's growth synergy run-rate grew 14 percent.

Electronic and Functional Materials
Sales in Electronic and Functional Materials were $1.2 billion, up 11 percent from the same quarter last year, driven by volume growth of 3 percent and a price gain of 8 percent.
Dow Electronic Materials reported the strongest demand growth in the Semiconductor Technologies and Display Technologies businesses, driven by new product introductions, positions in higher-growth advanced technology nodes and solid growth in organic light emitting diode (OLED) materials. In Asia Pacific, Dow Electronic Materials reported demand growth across all business units. The business recorded several customer wins in the quarter involving chemical mechanical planarization pads and slurries, photoresist and display films.
Functional Materials reported a double-digit increase in sales versus the year-ago period, driven primarily by price. Dow Wolff Cellulosics reported double-digit volume growth in EMEA and demand gains in North America, driven by food and pharmaceuticals demand. Dow Microbial Control continued to see volume growth in North America, led by ongoing demand from energy end-markets. Dow Home and Personal Care reported volume growth in all geographic areas excluding North America, with the largest gains in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Equity earnings were $23 million, reflecting the contribution from Dow Corning. This result was flat with the same period last year. EBITDA for the segment was $306 million, which compares with EBITDA of $277 million in the year-ago period.
Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions
Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions sales were $1.9 billion, with volume down 4 percent and price up 14 percent. Double-digit price gains were reported in all businesses except Dow Water and Process Solutions, where price was up 5 percent.
Dow Building and Construction reported a double-digit price gain overall, with increases in all geographic areas. Ongoing depressed demand conditions in North America and EMEA were offset by double-digit growth in the emerging regions. Results for the business were partly impacted by ongoing investment in the DOW POWERHOUSE Solar Shingle, for which the business recently announced its commercial launch. Dow Coating Materials reported double-digit price gains across all geographic areas except EMEA, offsetting soft demand conditions. Dow Water and Process Solutions reported price and volume gains in EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific. The business saw double-digit demand growth in the emerging regions, fueled by strong gains in ion exchange resins, notably in Greater China.
Equity earnings were $72 million, largely reflecting the contribution from Dow Corning. This result is down slightly from the $75 million reported in the year-ago period. EBITDA for the segment was $372 million, which compares with EBITDA of $382 million in the same period last year.
Agricultural Sciences
Agricultural Sciences reported record third quarter sales of $1.2 billion, up 27 percent compared with the year-ago period. Volume increased 18 percent and price rose 9 percent. Double-digit sales and volume gains were reported in all geographic areas, led by Latin America. The business continues to benefit from solid industry fundamentals, with elevated farm income levels providing strong incentive for farmers to maximize yields.
Agricultural Chemicals reported demand growth of more than 20 percent driven by continued adoption of new products and increased sales of range and pasture herbicides in Latin America, cereal herbicides in Europe, and corn and soybean herbicides in the United States. In Seeds, Traits and Oils, corn seed volume grew more than 15 percent versus the same period last year.
Year to date, Seeds, Traits and Oils has reported demand growth of more than 25 percent, with significant gains in key crops, including corn and cotton. The business finished a solid cotton season in the United States, having grown 10 share points over the last two seasons to nearly 20 percent in 2011, helped by an increase in U.S. planted acres and continued penetration of PhytoGen
cottonseeds. In corn, the business continued to report good adoption of SmartStax
hybrids in North America.
EBITDA for the segment was $75 million, compared with a loss of $12 million in the year-ago period.
Performance Materials
Sales in Performance Materials were $3.7 billion, with volume down 3 percent and price up 15 percent. Double-digit price gains were reported in all geographic areas and in most businesses in response to higher raw material costs. Volume growth in Latin America and North America was more than offset by declines in EMEA and Asia Pacific.
Amines reported price and volume gains globally, with notable demand growth in the emerging regions. The business continued to see solid fundamentals in agriculture and energy end-markets. Dow Automotive Systems reported price and volume expansion in all geographic areas. The business reported double-digit demand growth globally for its adhesives platform, and recorded gains for technology-differentiated products in acoustical applications and polyurethane-based formulations. Dow Formulated Systems reported price increases in all geographic areas. However, demand continued to be restrained by weak construction end-markets in developed regions, as well as a pause in wind energy investments in Asia Pacific.
Epoxy reported a modest sales gain versus the year-ago period, with double-digit price increases in all geographic areas. Demand grew in all geographic areas except EMEA, where the business chose to forego low-margin volume. Oxygenated Solvents reported double-digit price gains in all geographic areas, while volume fell slightly as demand growth in emerging geographies partially offset declines in developed regions. Polyglycols, Surfactants and Fluids reported a double-digit price gain and modest volume growth globally. The business recorded demand growth in de-icing applications in anticipation of the winter season, and strong sales of high temperature heat transfer fluids used in solar applications in EMEA. Polyurethanes reported strong price gains globally and a slight gain in volume. In North America, the business reported double-digit volume growth driven by demand in furniture and bedding applications. The business recently announced the successful start-up of its new joint venture propylene oxide facility in Thailand.
EBITDA for the quarter was $478 million, compared with $513 million in the year-ago period.

Performance Plastics
Sales in Performance Plastics rose 16 percent to $4.1 billion, with a 1 percent gain on volume, and a 15 percent increase on price. The division reported strong performance in Dow Elastomers, which had double-digit volume growth and price increases. Polyethylene recorded another strong quarter of volume growth in Asia Pacific as it continues to benefit from its joint venture facility in Thailand. However, the business experienced margin contraction year-over-year due to higher planned turnaround expenditures, an increase in ethylene production costs and a softening in demand in the developed regions. Dow Packaging and Converting reported a modest gain in volume driven by growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Results in Dow Electrical and Telecommunications were partially impacted by a decline in volume due to monetary tightening policies and decreased infrastructure activity from state-owned utilities in emerging geographies.
Equity earnings for the segment were $150 million, which compares with $58 million in the year-ago period. Equity earnings in the quarter included a pretax $86 million gain related to cash collected on a previously impaired note receivable related to Equipolymers, a nonconsolidated affiliate. Excluding this certain item, equity earnings were $64 million. EBITDA for the segment was $834 million, or $748 million excluding certain items. This compares with EBITDA of $900 million in the same period last year, or $898 million excluding certain items.
Feedstocks and Energy
Sales in Feedstocks and Energy were $2.9 billion, up 34 percent from the same period last year. Volume decreased 2 percent and price rose 36 percent.
The Chlor-Alkali/Chlor-Vinyl business reported strong sales growth, with double-digit price increases in North America, Latin America and Europe. The largest price gains were reported in caustic soda, driven by tight supply and continued strong demand in the alumina and pulp and paper industries. Vinyl chloride monomer volume decreased due to the shutdown of an asset in Plaquemine, coupled with an ongoing weak outlook in construction end-markets. Ethylene Oxide/Ethylene Glycol sales increased 23 percent from the year-ago period, driven by price.
Equity earnings were $153 million for the quarter, which compares with $98 million in the year-ago period, driven by strong results in MEGlobal and Kuwait Olefins Company. EBITDA for the segment was $263 million, compared with $154 million in the same period last year.
Outlook
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Liveris said:
As we said at our recent Investor Day, we see ongoing volatility in the pace of global economic recovery, and consequently are prepared for jagged economic conditions over the near-term. Well-recognized headwinds in developed regions continue to restrain consumer spending and business investment. However, in emerging regions, growth in the middle class continues to drive demand, particularly as it pertains to infrastructure and urbanization. And we continue to see bright spots in recession-resistant sectors such as agriculture, food packaging, energy and water - markets where Dow commands leadership positions.
Our enhanced financial flexibility, industry-leading feedstock strength and diverse, well-balanced portfolio provide a new earnings foundation, and position us well to continue driving toward our profitability targets with confidence. Our diversification across sectors and geographies allows us to take advantage of growth where it occurs around the world. In the midst of these uncertain times, we have an enterprise that is strong and stable, with the levers in place to mitigate risk and achieve our financial targets.
Dow will host a live Webcast of its third quarter earnings conference call with investors to discuss its results, business outlook and other matters today at 10:00 a.m. ET on www.dow.com.
