DISPUTE RESOLUTION
 
 
(a)           All disputes, controversies or claims arising under, out of or in connection with this Guarantee (each a ), if not finally settled by agreement between the Parties, may be referred to by any Party to arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the ) in accordance with this Clause 17.1. Nothing in this Clause 17.1 shall prejudice the rights of a Party to:
Dispute
ICC Rules
 
 
 
The Request for Arbitration (as defined in the ICC Rules) shall be sent by the claimant(s) to all other Parties, whether or not such other Parties are named as respondents in the Request for Arbitration. A Party that is not named as a respondent in the Request for Arbitration may become a party to arbitral proceedings by submitting a written notice to this effect to the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the ) and to the other Parties within ten (10) days from the receipt by such Party of the Request for Arbitration. A Party that is named as a respondent in the Request for Arbitration may join any other Party to the arbitral proceedings by submitting a written notice to this effect to the ICC Court and to the other Parties within ten (10) days from the receipt by such Party of the Request for Arbitration.
ICC Court
 
(b)           There shall be three (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, that the parties to the arbitration shall have thirty (30) days after the confirmation of the second arbitrator to agree on the third arbitrator, who shall act as chairperson. Where there are more than two parties to the arbitration, the arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with Article 10 of the ICC Rules, that the parties to the arbitration shall have thirty (30) days after the confirmation of the second arbitrator to agree on the third arbitrator, who shall act as chairperson. The three (3) arbitrators shall constitute the

. The Parties agree that no provision in the ICC Rules will apply insofar as it renders any individual ineligible for appointment as arbitrator on the grounds of nationality.
Tribunal
 
(c)           The seat of the arbitration shall be London, England, and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The Tribunal shall have the right and authority to grant injunctive, declaratory and other equitable relief. Judgment upon any award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The award shall not be subject to appeal according to Section 69 of the English Arbitration Act of 1996. Section 45 of the English Arbitration Act of 1996 shall also not apply.
 
(d)           Where a Party (a ) is of the opinion that a Dispute raises issues or facts that are substantially the same as or connected with issues or facts raised in a dispute involving that Party under the Agreement (the ), the following provisions shall apply:
Common Party
Related Dispute(s)
 
 
 
(e)           The applicable arbitral tribunal, after having invited all parties to the Dispute and all parties to the Related Dispute(s) to make submissions on the issue of consolidation, may (but shall not be obliged to) direct that the Dispute and the Related Dispute(s) be dealt with in the same arbitration and the proceedings consolidated or otherwise be coordinated on such terms (including as to costs) as it considers just or may direct any of them to be heard one after another and may order any of them to be stayed until determination of any of them. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Parties adhere to and consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement contained in the Agreement.
 
(f)           If the applicable arbitral tribunal is unable or unwilling to determine both the Dispute and the Related Dispute, the Dispute shall proceed to be finally settled under the ICC Rules. The fact that an individual is a member of the arbitral tribunal appointed to determine the Related Dispute shall not in that case constitute a reason preventing that individual from being appointed to the arbitral tribunal for the Dispute.
 
(g)           The arbitrators in any consolidated or coordinated arbitration shall have the power at any time prior to signature or approval of the terms of reference under the ICC Rules, on the application of any Party or on their own motion, and on such terms as they consider just, to order that the arbitration as between any two (2) or more Persons proceed separately, but
 
 
 
 
    
ANNEX F-1
Page 18
       
before the same arbitrators, from the arbitration as between any other two (2) or more Persons, and to make any directions consequent thereon as they consider expedient for the future conduct of all such proceedings.
  
(h)           The Parties irrevocably waive any claim to any damages in the nature of punitive or exemplary damages, and the Tribunal is specifically divested of any power to award such damages.
 
(i)           Without prejudice to any other mode of service allowed under any relevant law, each of the Parties agrees that any process in relation to any proceedings before the English courts in connection with any arbitration commenced under this Guarantee shall be duly served upon it if delivered personally or sent by registered post in the case of:
 
 
 
or such other person and address in England and Wales as a Party shall by Notice inform the other Party from time to time. Each Party represents and warrants that its agent has accepted the appointment and has agreed to act as agent for the service of process, and each Party agrees to take all action that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect.
 
(j)           Save and to the extent that disclosure may be required by law or otherwise required by a court or arbitral tribunal or to enforce or challenge an award, the Parties undertake to keep confidential the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder, and undertake not to disseminate to any third party nor use for any purpose other than the arbitration immediately at hand any documents or information disclosed to them in any such arbitration, without the prior written consent of all the Parties concerned, that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a party from disclosing information to actual or potential witnesses or experts where necessary for their selection or the preparation of any claim or defence in the arbitration.

18.           
IMMUNITY
 
To the extent that any Party may in any jurisdiction claim for itself for its assets immunity from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before judgment or otherwise), or other legal process and to the extent that in any such jurisdiction there may be attributed to itself or its assets such immunity (whether or not claimed), such Party hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waives such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Guarantee constitute private and commercial acts.

ANNEX F-2
Page 7
       
(a)           irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Beneficiary the punctual performance and observance by the Parent Guarantor of each and all of the Guaranteed Obligations which have become due and performable and which may become due and performable according to the terms of the Parent Guarantee (including all expenses and legal fees incurred by the Beneficiary in connection with the Beneficiary seeking to enforce the Parent Guarantee);
 
(b)           without prejudice to paragraph (a) of this Clause 2.1, undertakes to the Beneficiary that:
 
 
 
(c)           agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Beneficiary from and against any documented losses, damages, claims, costs, charges, and expenses arising out of any failure by the Parent Guarantor to perform each and all of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Parent Guarantor when and if such Guaranteed Obligations become due and performable according to the terms of the Parent Guarantee.

3.           
PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS
 
 
The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee:
 
(a)           are primary and not by way of surety;

provided

(a)           this Guarantee shall continue in accordance with its terms as if such release, discharge, or other arrangement had not been given or made in respect of the avoided or reduced payment or other disposition; and
 
(b)           the Beneficiary shall be entitled to recover or enforce the value or amount of that security or payment from the Guarantor, as if the release, discharge, or other arrangement had not occurred,

ANNEX F-2
Page 12
