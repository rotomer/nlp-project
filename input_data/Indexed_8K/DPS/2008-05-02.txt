This obligation shall not apply to:
     (i) information that, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or generally known in the industry, other than as a result of a breach by the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives of any of the provisions of this Agreement or of any other duty of confidentiality owed to the other party or its Recipients;

All Tax Returns and Taxes referred to in this Section 3 shall be timely filed with and timely paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, and
               (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to Confectionery Transactions and other transactions and items supported by the issuance to CS and/or one of its Subsidiaries by a law firm or accounting firm prior to the Demerger Date, of a no less than "more likely than not" opinion (or substantially equivalent written advice) supporting the Tax treatment thereof, the DPS Group will follow, adopt and fully support Income Tax reporting positions that are consistent with the conclusions in those opinions (or substantially equivalent written advice), in each case absent a material change in applicable Tax law after the Demerger Date, which change invalidates one or more of such conclusions and which change is confirmed in writing by independent, nationally recognized Tax counsel selected by CS and reasonably acceptable to DPS. Without limiting the foregoing, each member of the DPS Group will file (and support the filing by the Cadbury Group of) Tax Returns consistently with such positions and opinions (or substantially equivalent written advice), which Tax Returns do not include either (x) a Form 8275 (or the substantial equivalent form for state, local or foreign purposes) with respect to any such Confectionery Transaction or other transaction or item or (y) a Form 8886 (or the substantial equivalent form for state, local or foreign purposes) with respect to any such transaction or item. The DPS Group will promptly notify CS in writing of any legislation or other item that may represent such a material change in applicable Tax law. For the avoidance of doubt, the DPS Group acknowledges and agrees that, absent such a material change in applicable Tax law that is confirmed pursuant to this Section 3(d)(ii), with respect to any Confectionery Transaction or other transaction or item supported by the issuance to CS of a no less than "more likely than not" opinion (or substantially equivalent written advice), the DPS Group shall not procure the services of any law firm or accounting firm to issue an opinion (or substantially equivalent written advice) in respect of such Confectionery Transaction or other transaction or item that is inconsistent with the conclusions set forth in such opinion (or substantially equivalent written advice) or otherwise challenge the treatment of such Confectionery Transaction or other transaction or item.
 
          (e) The filing of any Tax Return not otherwise expressly dealt with in this Section 3 shall be filed by the Person who is responsible for filing such Tax Return under applicable Tax law and the payment of any Taxes shown as due or otherwise required to be reported on such Tax Returns shall be the responsibility of the Person who is primarily liable for such Taxes under applicable Tax law. In the case of a consolidated, combined, unitary or other group Tax Return, the member or other entity whose activity or operations generate the Taxes for which payment is due (computed on a stand alone basis) shall be treated as the Person who is primarily liable for such Taxes under applicable Tax Law for purposes of this Agreement.
     
4. Carrybacks; Amended Tax Returns; Refunds; Transaction Costs; CDMI.
          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) to the extent permitted under applicable Tax law, each member of the DPS Group shall take all actions required to waive any carryback period with respect to any Tax Benefit Attribute that arises or otherwise becomes available after the Demerger, and (ii) no member of the DPS Group shall amend any Income Tax Return for a Pre-Demerger Period or a Straddle Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of carrying back any Tax Benefit Attribute from a Post-Demerger Period to a Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of CS (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). In the event that (A) CS consents to amending an Income Tax Return of the DPS Group, (B) a member of the DPS Group is not permitted under applicable Tax law to waive a carryback period in respect of a Tax Benefit Attribute and is required to carry back the Tax Benefit Attribute to a Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period, or (C) in the case of a Straddle Period, a Tax Benefit Attribute generated during the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Demerger Date reduces Taxes that were imposed during the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Demerger Date (for this purpose, treating the two portions of the Straddle Period as separate taxable years), CS shall be entitled to any refund, credit or similar benefit (including by way of being allowable as an offset and any interest with respect thereto) that results from the actions referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C) to the extent that any incremental Taxes or other costs are incurred by any member of the Cadbury Group and the excess, if any, shall be the property of the DPS Group; provided, however, that DPS will indemnify the Cadbury Group to the extent that the incremental Taxes or other costs incurred by the Cadbury Group pursuant to the CFC Legislation or otherwise exceeds the amount of the refund, credit or similar benefit.
          (b) Except as provided in Section 4(a), any refund of DPS Group Taxes (including by way of being allowable as an offset and any interest with respect thereto) shall be the property of the DPS Group and, if received by a member of the Cadbury Group, such refund shall promptly be paid over to DPS. Any refund of Cadbury Group Taxes and Incremental DPS Group Taxes (including by way of being allowable as an offset and any interest with respect thereto) shall be the property of the Cadbury Group and, if received by a member of the DPS Group, such refund shall promptly be paid over to CS. In the event of a subsequent disallowance by a Tax Authority of any refund that has been paid over to CS or DPS pursuant to this Section 4(b), CS or DPS, as the case may be, shall return such payment together with any applicable interest.
          (c) (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3 to the contrary, no later
 
than 45 days following the Demerger Date, CS shall consult with DPS in respect of the Tax treatment by any member of the DPS Group of DPS Transaction Costs to be reflected on the IRS Form 1120 for CSAI and its U.S. Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2007, and no later than 90 days prior to the timely filing of the IRS Form 1120 for the DPS Group for the taxable year that includes the Demerger Date and each taxable year thereafter, DPS shall consult with CS in respect of the Tax treatment by any member of the DPS Group of DPS Transaction Costs to be reflected in such IRS Form 1120 and subsequent IRS Form 1120s of the DPS Group. In the event that DPS disputes the proposed Tax treatment by CS of DPS Transaction Costs, CS, at the joint expense of DPS and CS, will provide DPS with an opinion (or substantially equivalent written advice) of a law firm or accounting firm of internationally recognized standing and expert in the Tax matters at issue, reasonably acceptable to DPS, supporting the Tax treatment of such DPS Transaction Costs on no less than a should basis. In respect of the taxable year ending on December 31, 2007, and each taxable year thereafter, DPS shall, in accordance with Section 4(c)(ii), make a payment to CS in an amount, if any, equal to 50% of the actual reduction in Taxes of, in the case of the taxable year ending on December 31, 2007, CSAI and its U.S. Subsidiaries and, in the case of the taxable year that includes the Demerger Date and each taxable year thereafter, the DPS Group (or any member thereof), in each case, determined on a with and without basis, for such taxable year resulting from the use of any Tax Benefit Attributes related to one or more DPS Transaction Costs.
               (ii) Within 10 days of the timely filing of the IRS Form 1120 for CSAI and its U.S. Subsidiaries for the taxable year that ends on December 31, 2007, and within 10 days of the timely filing of the IRS Form 1120 for the DPS Group (or corresponding successor Tax Return) for the taxable year that includes the Demerger Date and each taxable year thereafter, DPS shall (A) provide CS with an executed officer's certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of any actual reduction in Taxes described in Section 4(c)(i) for such taxable year, and (B) pay to CS the amount of such reduction in Taxes; provided that the DPS Group shall provide CS, in accordance with Section 8, access to any documents or other information that CS reasonably determines is necessary to confirm the statements set forth in the officer's certificate and the amount of such payment. Any amount paid by DPS to CS pursuant to this Section 4(c)(ii) shall be adjusted to reflect any Final Determination with respect to the Tax treatment of DPS Transaction Costs and payments between CS and DPS to reflect any such adjustment shall be made as necessary within 10 days of such determination.
          (d) (i) If, on or prior to June 30, 2009, CS (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) notifies DPS (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) that a C Election will be made in respect of eligible capital property, DPS agrees to pay CS an amount equal to C$7,000,000 per year (each, an "Initial Tax Benefit Amount") in respect of the calendar year that includes the Demerger Date and each of the next 9 succeeding calendar years, and an amount equal to C$20,250,000 (the "Final Tax Benefit Amount") in respect of the 10th succeeding calendar year (such 10th succeeding calendar year, the "Final Year") following the calendar year that includes the Demerger Date (such calendar years, in the aggregate, the "Applicable Period") in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(d). DPS and CS acknowledge and agree that the Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount are based on a C Election that results in a cumulative eligible capital amount of C$420,000,000; provided that, to the extent that the actual amount of the resulting cumulative eligible capital amount is greater than or less than
 
C$420,000,000, the Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount shall be proportionately adjusted (e.g., if the actual amount of the cumulative eligible capital amount is C$210,000,000, the Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount would each be reduced by 50%); provided further that, to the extent that, pursuant to a Final Determination, the amount of the cumulative eligible capital amount is determined to be greater than or less than C$420,000,000, the Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount shall be proportionately adjusted in a similar manner. Subject to this Section 4(d), an amount equal to each Initial Tax Benefit Amount, in the case of a calendar year in the Applicable Period (other than the Final Year), and, in the case of the Final Year, the Final Tax Benefit Amount, shall be paid by DPS to CS (or a Subsidiary of CS pursuant to Section 4(e)) within 30 days of the due date for the timely filing of the Canadian federal Income Tax Return for CDMI (or its successors) or, if no longer CDMI, that of the principal Subsidiary of DPS organized or doing business in Canada, for the taxable year that ends on the close of or in such calendar year (the "Canadian Tax Return") but in no event shall the payment by DPS to CS of each Initial Tax Benefit Amount and, in the case of the Final Year, the Final Tax Benefit Amount, be made later than September 1st of the each succeeding calendar year beginning in 2009.
               (ii) Notwithstanding Section 4(d)(i), the full amount of the Initial Tax Benefit Amount in respect of a calendar year in the Applicable Period (other than the Final Year) and, in the case of the Final Year, the Final Tax Benefit Amount shall be paid by DPS only if the gross revenues (computed without taking into account discounts) of CDMI (or its successors) and any other Subsidiaries of DPS organized or doing business in Canada (including their branches) for such calendar year or Final Year, as applicable, determined in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (the "Actual Gross Revenues Amount") equals or exceeds C$200,000,000 (the "Threshold Gross Revenues Amount"); provided that the Actual Gross Revenues Amount for the Final Year shall be increased by an amount equal to the Excess Actual Gross Revenues Amount (as defined below); provided, further, that if CDMI (or its successors) or one or more such Subsidiaries of DPS (including their branches) sells or otherwise transfers a substantial portion of its assets to any Person (other than another Subsidiary of the DPS Group), CS and DPS shall negotiate in good faith to proportionately adjust the Threshold Gross Receipts Amount for the calendar year in which the sale or transfer occurs and subsequent calendar years to reflect such sale or transfer. The "Excess Actual Gross Revenues Amount" shall be an aggregate amount equal to the total amount, if any, by which the Actual Gross Revenues Amount for each calendar year during the Applicable Period (other than the Final Year) exceeds C$200,000,000, less any Actual Gross Revenues Amount in excess of C$200,000,000 for a calendar year that was used in calendar years prior to the Final Year to increase the amount payable to CS pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) in respect of any carryforwards of Initial Tax Benefit Amounts.
               (iii) In respect of each of the 11 calendar years included in the Applicable Period, DPS shall, within 10 days of the timely filing of the Canadian Tax Return for the taxable year that ends on the close of or in each such calendar year but in no event later than August 1st of the next succeeding calendar year, provide CS with an executed officer's certificate (A) stating the Actual Gross Revenues Amount and (B) setting forth in reasonable detail the determination that the Actual Gross Revenues Amount is either greater than or less than the Threshold Gross Receipts Amount; provided that, DPS shall provide CS, in accordance with
 
Section 8, access to any documents or other information that CS reasonably determines is necessary to confirm the statements set forth in the officer's certificate. If the Actual Gross Revenues Amount is less than the Threshold Gross Revenues Amount for a calendar year in the Applicable Period other than the Final Year, (A) the amount of the Initial Tax Benefit Amount payable by DPS for such calendar year shall be proportionately reduced (e.g., if the Actual Gross Revenues Amount for a calendar year is C$100,000,000, the amount of the Initial Tax Benefit Amount currently required to be paid by DPS to CS in respect of such calendar year would be reduced by 50%), and (B) the portion of the Initial Tax Benefit Amount not required to currently be paid shall be carried forwarded and added to the Initial Tax Benefit Amount or the Final Tax Benefit Amount, as applicable, that is due in respect of the next succeeding calendar year in the Applicable Period and shall be payable in accordance with this Section 4(d)(iii). Any remaining amount of an Initial Tax Benefit Amount not paid pursuant to the limitation described in the preceding sentence shall be carried forward and shall be paid in respect of the first succeeding calendar year in the Applicable Period in which the Actual Gross Revenues Amount is more than C$200,000,000 but, except with respect to the Final Year, only to the extent of the excess Initial Tax Benefit Amount for such calendar year determined on a proportionate basis to the Actual Gross Revenues Amount (e.g., if the Actual Gross Revenues Amount is C$400,000,000 for a calendar year and the Initial Tax Benefit Amount (not including carryforwards) is C$7,000,000, then up to C$7,000,000 of carried forward Initial Tax Benefit Amounts shall be due and payable along with the amount of the Initial Tax Benefit Amount for such calendar year). With respect to the Final Year, (A) if the Actual Gross Revenues Amount plus any Excess Actual Gross Revenues Amount exceed the Threshold Gross Revenues Amount, the Final Tax Benefit Amount and any carried forward Initial Tax Benefit Amounts shall be paid in full by DPS to CS, and (B) if the Actual Gross Revenues Amount plus any Excess Actual Gross Revenues Amount is less than the Threshold Gross Revenues Amount the amount of the aggregate of the Final Tax Benefit Amount and any carried forward Initial Tax Benefit Amounts that is required to be paid in full by DPS to CS shall be reduced on a proportionate basis and the amount of the reduction shall be ratably allocated over the next 5 succeeding calendar years and shall be computed on a present value basis using a discount rate equal to the rate on 5-year U.S. Treasury securities (in effect at the time of the computation) plus 4% and the aggregate amount so computed shall be paid by DPS to CS on the payment date for the Final Year (as set forth in Section 4(d)(i)) (e.g., if, in the Final Year, the Actual Gross Revenues Amount plus any Excess Actual Gross Revenues Amount is C$100,000,000 and the total amount of the Final Tax Benefit Amount and the carried forward Initial Tax Benefit Amounts are C$40,000,000, then C$20,000,000 is required to be paid in full and the remaining C$20,000,000 would be ratably allocated over the next five years and subject to the net present value computation described above and such computed amount, together with the C$20,000,000, would be paid by DPS and CS in respect of the Final Year).
               (iv) Notwithstanding Sections 4(d)(i), (ii) and (iii), to the extent that (A) a substantial portion of the assets of CDMI (or its successors) or one or more other Subsidiaries of DPS organized or doing business in Canada (including their branches) is sold or otherwise transferred to any Person (other than another Subsidiary of the DPS Group) during the Applicable Period and the proceeds of such sale or transfer (or a portion thereof) are applied to reduce the cumulative eligible capital account that is created by the C Election described in this Section 4(d), an amount equal to the reduction in such capital account multiplied by the
 
applicable Canadian tax rate in effect for the calendar year in which the sale or transfer occurs shall be paid by DPS to CS within 30 days of the closing of the sale or transfer and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate reductions in the Initial Tax Benefit Amount for such calendar year and subsequent calendar years and the Final Tax Benefit Amount, or (B) the stock, or substantially all of the assets, of CDMI (or its successors) or one or more other Subsidiaries of DPS organized or doing business in Canada (including their branches) is sold or otherwise transferred to any Person (other than another Subsidiary of the DPS Group) during the Applicable Period, the remaining Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount shall be computed on a present value basis using a discount rate equal to the rate on 5-year U.S. Treasury securities (in effect at the time of the computation) plus 4% and the aggregate computed amount shall be paid by DPS to CS within 30 days of the closing of the sale or transfer.
               (v) CS and DPS acknowledge and agree that on or before each of the 5th and 7th anniversaries of the Demerger Date, CS and DPS shall negotiate in good faith to determine a payment by DPS to CS that terminates any remaining Initial Tax Benefit Amounts and the Final Tax Benefit Amount that would be payable by DPS pursuant to and subject to the limitations of this Section 4(d); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if an agreement is not reached by CS and DPS, the provisions of this Section 4(d) shall continue to apply in accordance with their terms.
               (vi) DPS acknowledges and agrees that the DPS Group (and any member thereof as required by applicable Tax law) shall make a timely election pursuant to Code section 338(g) in respect of the acquisition of stock of CDMI from the Cadbury Group and shall timely file all corresponding IRS Forms required to be filed with the IRS in connection with the Code section 338(g) election and, except pursuant to a Final Determination, the DPS Group shall not take any action inconsistent with the Code section 338(g) election and the step-up in Tax basis of the assets of CDMI in respect of any Tax Return, audit or other proceeding or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, the treatment and reporting of the Code section 338(g) election in respect of CDMI on the IRS Form 1120 for the DPS Group for the taxable year that includes the Demerger Date shall be governed by this Section 4(d)(vi) and Section 3(b)(ii).
               (vii) In the event that, pursuant to a Final Determination, it is determined that CDMI was not entitled, pursuant to the Code section 338(g) election described in Section 4(d)(vi) or otherwise, to step-up the Tax basis of its assets to their respective values at the time of their acquisition by CDMI for U.S. federal income tax purposes in connection with the transfer of such assets from CBCI to CDMI and/or the various transactions pursuant to which the stock of CDMI was sold to the DPS Group prior to, and in connection with the Demerger, CS shall (i) repay to DPS the actual amounts of any Initial Tax Benefit Amounts or Final Tax Benefit Amount previously paid to CS pursuant to Section 4(d) and, for the avoidance of doubt, no further Initial Tax Benefit Amounts or Final Tax Benefit Amount shall be required to be paid by DPS to CS pursuant to this Section 4(d), and (ii) indemnify and hold the DPS Group harmless against any interest and penalties charged by the IRS pursuant to the Final Determination that are attributable to incremental U.S. federal income taxes, if any, that the DPS Group is required to pay in respect of previous distributions from CDMI as a result of recomputing the earnings and profits of CDMI for U.S. federal income tax purposes to reflect the disallowance of the step-up
 
adjustment of the Tax basis of the assets of CDMI; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, CS, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(b), shall have full control over any Tax Proceeding relating to or involving the Tax basis step-up or adjustment thereto in respect of the assets of CDMI for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
          (e) If requested by CS, DPS agrees to make any payment due under Section 4(c) or 4(d) to a Subsidiary of CS. In the event that a payment from DPS to CS (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) pursuant to Section 4(c) or 4(d) is subject to Tax deductions or withholdings under applicable Tax law or any Taxes are imposed on CS (or one or more of its Subsidiaries) in respect of such payment, DPS shall not be required to increase the payment or otherwise provide a gross-up to CS (or one or more of its Subsidiaries); provided that DPS agrees to cooperate with CS and to use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent such efforts will not result in materially adverse consequences to the DPS Group (or any member thereof)) to mitigate or avoid any applicable Tax deductions or withholdings or other Taxes imposed.
     .
5. Representations and Covenants of DPS
          (a) DPS, on behalf of the DPS Group, represents that as of the date hereof, and covenants that on the Demerger Date, there is no plan or intention by the DPS Group to:

               (i) throughout the twelve-month period following the Demerger Date, neither DPS nor the ATOB DPS Entity will liquidate, merge or consolidate with any other Person, DPS will continue to wholly-own the ATOB DPS Entity and no member of the DPS Group will sell, issue or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any equity interest, or an instrument convertible into an equity interest, in the ATOB DPS Entity;

               (vi) on or after the Demerger Date, except as otherwise provided by this Agreement and except for the transactions listed on Schedule G, DPS will not, nor will it permit any member of the DPS Group to (A) make or change any accounting method or amend any Tax Return, or (B) take any Tax position on an Income Tax Return that is outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with past practice, in each case, that results in an increased Tax liability or a reduction of Tax Benefit Attributes of the Cadbury Group or any member thereof in respect of any Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period including pursuant to the CFC Legislation; and
               (vii) DPS will preserve and maintain the separate legal existence, entity classification for Tax purposes and ownership structure of the Specified Entities (other than a Specified Entity that is listed as the predecessor of another Specified Entity on Schedule F), in each case, as in effect on the Demerger Date, until after the calendar year that includes the second anniversary of the Demerger Date.
          (c) DPS agrees that, regardless of whether CS consents to, or DPS receives a private letter ruling from the IRS or an opinion of Tax counsel with respect to, any action referred to in Section 5(b), CS is to have no liability for any Taxes or Damages (including pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement) resulting from any such action and DPS agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Cadbury Group against any such Taxes or Damages including Damages of the Cadbury Group relating to Taxes of shareholders of Cadbury and/or DPS incurred as a result of such actions. DPS shall also bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by CS in connection with obtaining any private letter ruling from the IRS or an opinion of Tax counsel or in connection with CS' determination of whether or not to grant any written consent required under Section 5(b).
 
     .
6. Indemnities
          (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, CS and each member of the Cadbury Group will jointly and severally indemnify DPS and the members of the DPS Group against, and hold them harmless from and shall pay any:

               (ii) Incremental DPS Group Taxes (except for any Incremental DPS Group Taxes that are attributable to actions taken by a member of the DPS Group after the Demerger Date other than actions that CS has expressly consented to in writing or actions taken pursuant to a Final Determination or required by this Agreement);
               (iii) Taxes of a member of the Cadbury Group for which a member of the DPS Group is responsible for (A) under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or similar provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. Tax law) solely as a result of such member of the DPS Group being or having been included in a Tax Return with any member of the Cadbury Group or otherwise joining in a fiscal unity or other combined group, or (B) as a consequence of the failure of any member of the Cadbury Group to discharge a liability for Tax for which a member of the Cadbury Group is primarily liable under applicable Tax law or (C) because a member of the DPS Group acted as a representative of a group of companies to the extent that the DPS Group Tax liability would have been a liability of a member of the Cadbury Group if the relevant member of the DPS Group did not act as representative;
               (iv) Damages resulting from or that are otherwise attributable to a breach by CS or any member of the Cadbury Group of any covenant made by CS in this Agreement; and
               (v) Out-of-pocket legal, accounting or similar expenses resulting from the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Taxes or Damages indemnified against and described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), including those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Taxes or Damages.

Group Tax liability would have been a liability of a member of the DPS Group if the relevant member of the Cadbury Group did not act as a representative;
               (iii) Damages resulting from or that are otherwise attributable to a breach by DPS or any member of the DPS Group of any representation set forth in Section 5 or any covenant made by DPS in this Agreement (including Section 5), including Damages of the Cadbury Group relating to Taxes of shareholders of Cadbury and/or DPS incurred as a result of such breach;
               (iv) Taxes of or otherwise imposed on CBCI in respect of transactions or operations in the ordinary course of business for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to December 31, 2007; and

          (c) (i) For purposes of this Section 6, (A) to the extent that a Confectionery Entity was included in a Tax Return of the DPS Group or a Beverage Entity was included in a Tax Return of the Cadbury Group, as the case may be, the Taxes of the Confectionery Entity or the Beverage Entity shall be computed on a stand-alone basis taking into account as an offset any Taxes (including estimated) paid on account of such Confectionery Entity or Beverage Entity prior to the Demerger Date, and (B) in the case of a Confectionery Entity or Beverage Entity that is a pass-through or other fiscally transparent entity for Tax purposes, the pass-through or other fiscally transparent status of such entity shall be respected so that the Taxes, including Taxes resulting from a Tax adjustment or other change in respect of such entity shall, pursuant to applicable Tax law, be treated as imposed on the members (or other equityholders) of the Confectionery Entity or Beverage Entity and nothing in this Agreement shall be read to require indemnification of such entity on account of such Taxes (including an adjustment to such Taxes) on the grounds that such Taxes (or adjustment) are Taxes of such entity (as opposed to its members).
               (ii) As a supplement to, but without duplication of the rights and obligations provided in Section 6(a), if, pursuant to a Final Determination in respect of a Pre-Demerger Period of Cadbury Adams USA LLC, there is an adjustment in respect of Cadbury Adams USA LLC that results in (A) an increase to DPS Group Taxes, computed on a with and without basis in respect of such adjustment, CS shall pay to DPS an amount equal to such increase in DPS Group Taxes, or (B) a decrease to DPS Group Taxes, computed on a with and without basis in respect of such adjustment, DPS shall pay to CS an amount equal to such decrease in DPS Group Taxes. Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 6(c)(ii) shall be made within 10 days of the Final Determination in respect of the adjustment.
               (iii) Notwithstanding Sections 6(a) and 6(b), except as provided in Section 6(c)(ii), neither the DPS Group nor the Cadbury Group shall be required to indemnify the other party against a loss or reduction of a Tax Benefit Attribute arising as a result of an amended Tax Return, audit, agreed determination or other adjustment, claim or decision in respect of a Pre-
 
Demerger Period or a Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Cadbury Group is not representing or warranting to the amount of any Tax basis in respect of the DPS Group or its members or assets.
          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the DPS Group or the Cadbury Group, as the case may be, shall not be liable for any Taxes or Damages pursuant to this Section 6 if the Damages and Taxes for which indemnification is being claimed pursuant to this Section 6 do not exceed the amount of $350,000 for (i) a single claim, or (ii) related claims involving one or more jurisdictions and arising out of the same or similar facts.
          (e) The DPS Group and the Cadbury Group shall discharge their respective obligations under Section 6, by paying the relevant amount no later than 5 days after (i) the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax Return of the Cadbury Group or the DPS Group for a Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period, as the case may be, that reports an amount of Tax that is indemnified against under this Agreement, (ii) an agreement between CS and DPS that a payment is due or (iii) a Final Determination in respect of the relevant Tax matter or a final decision in respect of another amount indemnified against; provided that, in the case of a written Tax assessment or other similar written claim from a Taxing Authority that is required to be paid prior to contesting such Tax assessment or claim, payment under this Section 6(e) shall be due no later than 5 days prior to the due date for payment of such Tax assessment. Any indemnification payment for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the currency of the jurisdiction that imposes the Taxes indemnified against. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Section 6 will be treated as a contribution to DPS or CSAI, or as a distribution from DPS or CSAI to CS or Cadbury or other type of payment as is consistent with applicable Tax law, occurring immediately prior to and in connection with the Demerger, and shall be paid free and clear of any Tax deduction or withholding. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent such efforts will not result in materially adverse consequences to a party) to mitigate or avoid such Tax deductions or withholdings.
          (f) (i) Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Section 6 or Article VII of the Separation Agreement shall, subject to this Section 6(f), be (A) decreased by the amount of any net Tax benefit (including, to the extent provided in Section 6(f)(ii), an increase to Tax basis) realized by the indemnified party (including the consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group of which the indemnified party is a member) arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of the amount indemnified against, and (B) increased by the amount of any net Tax cost incurred (including a gross-up for any amounts required to be deducted or withheld from the indemnity payment under applicable Tax law) by the indemnified party (including the consolidated, combined, unitary or other Tax group of which the indemnified party is a member) arising in connection with the accrual or receipt of any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 6 or such Article VII.
               (ii) In computing the amount of any net Tax benefit or net Tax cost, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any indemnifiable amount or arising in connection with the accrual or receipt of any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 6 or Article VII of the Separation Agreement.
 
For these purposes, an indemnified party shall be deemed to have "realized" a net Tax benefit or "incurred" a net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such indemnified party is reduced below or increased above, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes that such indemnified party would be required to pay but for incurrence or payment of the indemnifiable amount or the receipt of the indemnity payment; provided that the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that the net Tax benefit includes an increase in Tax basis (A) in respect of an asset for which amortization, depreciation or similar deductions are allowable, the parties shall compute such net Tax benefit on a present value basis using a discount rate equal to the rate on 5-year U.S. Treasury securities (in effect at the time the parties are computing the applicable net Tax benefit) plus 4%; provided, however, that if the present value of the net Tax benefit exceeds $20 million then until the net present value of the unrealized net Tax benefit does not exceed $20 million, the indemnified party shall make periodic reimbursements to the indemnifying party in respect of such net Tax benefit to the extent that such net Tax benefit is "realized" by the indemnified party (as determined pursuant to the general principles of this Section 6(f)(ii)), or (B) in respect of an equity interest or other asset for which amortization, depreciation or similar deductions are not allowable, the amount of the indemnification payment shall be subject to adjustment on account of such increase in Tax basis only if a net Tax benefit in respect of such increase to Tax basis is realized prior to or within the 5-year period following the later of the end of the calendar year in which the indemnity payment is made or in which there is a Final Determination with respect to the matter indemnified against in accordance with Section 6(f)(iii). The parties shall make any adjusting payment between each other as is required pursuant this Section 6(f) within 10 days of the date an indemnified party is deemed to have realized a net Tax benefit or incurred a net Tax cost. The amount of any increase or reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any Final Determination with respect to the indemnified party's liability for Taxes. Payments between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party to reflect any such adjustment shall be made as necessary within 10 days of such determination. For the avoidance of doubt, in computing the amount of Incremental DPS Group Taxes indemnified against, any Tax Benefit Attribute that becomes available to the DPS Group (or any member thereof) as a result of the additional Income Taxes imposed in respect of a Confectionery Transaction shall be taken into account when realized (as determined pursuant to the principles of this Section 6(f)) and shall reduce the amount of Incremental DPS Group Taxes indemnified against under Section 6(a).
               (iii) The parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that, pursuant to this Section 6(f), there is a net Tax benefit that includes an increase in Tax basis in respect of an equity interest or other asset for which amortization, depreciation or similar deductions are not allowable, DPS shall, on an annual basis during the applicable 5-year period set forth in Section 6(f)(ii), provide CS with an executed officer's certificate, satisfactory to CS in its reasonable discretion, specifying in reasonable detail whether or not the DPS Group realized a net Tax benefit in respect of such increase in Tax basis; provided that if the asset disposition occurs, or the Tax basis benefit is otherwise realized in respect of a taxable period, prior to such 5-year period, DPS shall provide CS with such an executed officer's certificate within 10 days of the event (including a Final Determination) in respect of which the Tax basis was increased and the net Tax benefit was realized; provided further that the DPS Group shall provide CS, in accordance with Section 8, access to any documents or other information that CS reasonably determines is necessary to confirm the statements set forth in any officer's certificate provided
 
pursuant to this Section 6(f)(iii). In the event that the DPS Group realizes a net Tax benefit in respect of such an increase in Tax basis in respect of a taxable period prior to or during the first year of the applicable 5-year period, DPS shall pay to CS an amount equal to 50% of such net Tax benefit and, if such a net Tax benefit is realized during any succeeding year of such 5-year period, the amount that DPS is required to pay CS shall decrease by 5% each year so that the payment would be 30% of the next Tax benefit if realized during the fifth year of the 5-year period. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that a payment from DPS to CS pursuant to Section 6(f)(ii) or this Section 6(f)(iii) is subject to Tax deductions or withholdings under applicable Tax law or any Taxes are imposed on CS in respect of such payment, DPS shall not be required to increase the payment or otherwise provide a gross-up to CS; provided that DPS agrees to cooperate with CS and to use commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent such efforts will not result in materially adverse consequences to the DPS Group (or any member thereof)) to mitigate or avoid any applicable Tax deductions or withholdings or other Taxes imposed.
               (iv) Without duplication, if, as a result of an amended Tax Return, claim for refund, audit, agreed determination or other adjustment, claim or decision, the amounts indemnified against by the Cadbury Group pursuant to Section 6(a) or DPS Group pursuant to Section 6(b), as the case may be, is increased and there is a Tax benefit (including an adjustment to the Tax basis of an asset) that is realized by the other party, such other party shall promptly pay to CS or DPS, as the case may be, the amount of the Tax benefit less any incremental Tax or other cost of such other party, computed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(f).
          (g) Each member of the DPS Group shall act in a commercially reasonable manner in respect of their Tax matters and shall not proactively disclose to any person any material information regarding the Income Tax reporting positions or Income Tax Returns of any member of the DPS Group in respect of a Pre-Demerger or Straddle Period except (i) to any of its legal, accounting and tax personnel, outside legal and tax advisors, and auditors, but only to the extent necessary for tax and financial reporting purposes, provided that such persons are instructed to keep such information confidential, or to such other persons as is otherwise required to comply with applicable law; or (ii) in response to a request by a Taxing Authority (in connection with an audit or other proceeding), to the extent that the DPS Group determines, in its good faith discretion, which shall be presumed, that such information should be disclosed. If any member of the DPS Group makes any such disclosure to any person (including a Taxing Authority) in circumstances other than permitted above, the Cadbury Group shall not be required to indemnify the DPS Group for any associated Taxes that the Cadbury Group otherwise would be required to indemnify the DPS Group against pursuant to this Section 6.
          (h) For purposes of this Agreement (taking into account the responsibility for Taxes under this Agreement), in computing amounts indemnified against and for purposes of preparing DPS Transition Returns and other Tax Returns, if an allocation of Taxes is required for a member of the Cadbury Group or the DPS Group (or a Subsidiary thereof) for a Straddle Period or other taxable period then the amount of such Tax that is allocable to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Demerger Date or other date for which the allocation is relevant shall be: (i) in the case of income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and other Taxes that are readily apportionable based on an actual or deemed closing of the books, the portion of any
 
such Tax equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the taxable year of any entity that is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) ended on the Demerger Date or other relevant date, and (ii) in the case of property and other Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of any such Tax equal to the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the taxable period ending on the Demerger Date or other relevant date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period. Any Tax Benefit Attribute for a Straddle Period or other taxable period for which an allocation is required for a member of the Cadbury Group or the DPS Group (or a Subsidiary thereof) shall be allocated in the same manner as provided in this Section 6(h) as the Tax to which the Tax Benefit Attribute relates.
          (i) The indemnification obligations contained in this Section 6 or otherwise in this Agreement shall remain in effect until 30 days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (giving effect to any extension, waiver or mitigation thereof) and, with respect to any claim hereunder initiated prior to the end of such period, until such claim has been satisfied or otherwise resolved.
     CS shall guarantee or otherwise perform the obligations of each member of the Cadbury Group under this Agreement. DPS shall guarantee or otherwise perform the obligations of each member of the DPS Group under this Agreement.
7. Guarantees.
     
8. Cooperation.
          (a) CS and DPS shall each, at their own expense, cooperate with each other (and shall cause each member of the Cadbury Group and the DPS Group, respectively, to cooperate) and make available to each other, their officers, agents and personnel and such Tax and accounting data and other information as may be reasonably required in connection with (i) the preparation or filing of any Tax Return, election, consent, certification, declaration or authorization of representative, or any claim for refund, including executing such items where required, (ii) any determinations of liability for Taxes, or (iii) any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes including cooperating in connection with the exercise of contest rights under Section 9. Without limiting the foregoing, the members of the DPS Group and the Cadbury Group, as the case may be, shall not be entitled to assert privilege or any similar argument against the members of the other group with respect to legal and other professional services or documents (both internal and external), in each case, in respect of Tax matters of the Cadbury Group and the DPS Group for Pre-Demerger Periods or Straddle Periods. At the request of CS and in connection with a Confectionery Transaction, DPS shall make (or cause to be made or permit CS to make) one or more Tax elections, as directed by CS (for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this sentence shall limit the obligations of the Cadbury Group to indemnify the DPS Group for Confectionery Transactions pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement). The Cadbury Group and the DPS Group shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all Tax and accounting records or other documents in their possession relating to material Tax and accounting matters of the DPS Group for any Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period until the later of (i) seven years after the Demerger Date or (ii) one year after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including extensions thereof). After such time, before the Cadbury Group or the
 
DPS Group shall dispose of any such documents in their possession, the other party shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other party's expense). The parties agree to use their best efforts to maintain privilege or other protection in respect of third parties regarding any documents or other information relating to Tax matters provided by the Cadbury Group or the DPS Group, as the case may be, to the other group.
          (b) (i) (A) Without limiting Section 8(a), the DPS Group shall provide the Cadbury Group and its officers, agents and personnel with access to and the right to copy such documents, and shall provide such other information, as are reasonably necessary to allow the Cadbury Group to determine and report their Taxes for any Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period and to prepare any applicable Tax Return or other required filings of the Cadbury Group. The DPS Group acknowledges and agrees that the rights afforded to the Cadbury Group under this Section 8(b)(i) are, among other things, intended to enable the Cadbury Group to prepare, at its expense, profit and loss statements, balance sheets and other financial statements or accounting information with respect to each member of the DPS Group on a stand-alone or legal entity basis as of or prior to the Demerger Date and, in the case of a jurisdiction in which the Taxable year of a DPS Group member does not end on the Demerger Date, as of the end of the Taxable year in which the Demerger Date occurs.
                    (B) DPS shall deliver or cause to be delivered to CS, or otherwise make available to CS, information in respect of the accounting systems of the DPS Group for Pre-Demerger Periods and Straddle Periods to enable CS to create the DPS Statements (as defined below) no later than 45 days after the Demerger Date. Based on the information in respect of the accounting systems of the DPS Group for Pre-Demerger Periods and Straddle Periods (the "DPS Information") that CS is entitled to download or otherwise acquire pursuant to this Section 8, CS will create profits and loss statements and balance sheets for each legal entity of the DPS Group for the period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on the Demerger Date in accordance with the accounting policies of the DPS Group as of, and prior to, the Demerger Date (the "DPS Statements") and shall deliver the DPS Information and DPS Statements to DPS within 90 days of the Demerger Date (or such other time as CS shall determine and notify DPS in writing); provided that DPS, at its expense, shall provide any reasonable cooperation requested by CS in preparing the DPS Statements, including the provision of any other information that CS determines is reasonably necessary to prepare the DPS Statements in accordance with such accounting policies of the DPS Group. Within 45 days of the receipt of the DPS Information and DPS Statements by DPS, DPS shall confirm in writing to CS that (A) the DPS Information downloaded or otherwise acquired by DPS was properly extracted from the DPS accounting systems, is accurate and complete in all material respects and is properly identified on an entity-by-entity basis, and (B) the accounting policies used by CS in preparing the DPS Statements are consistent in all material respects with the accounting policies of the DPS Group as of, and prior to, the Demerger Date; provided that if DPS is unable to provide such written confirmation, (X) DPS shall provide CS, within 45 days of the receipt of the DPS Information and DPS Statements by DPS, with a written statement setting forth in detail the reasons that such confirmation could not be made, (Y) DPS shall, at its expense, cooperate with CS to correct the DPS Information or DPS Statements, including any improper extraction of the DPS Information or any inconsistencies in the accounting policies used by CS to prepare the
 
DPS Statements, and (Z) within 20 days of the receipt of revised DPS Information and DPS Statements, DPS shall provide the written confirmation contemplated by this Section 8(b)(iii) to CS; provided, further, that the principles of the preceding proviso shall continue to apply until CS receives such written confirmation.
               (ii) Without limiting Sections 8(a) and 8(b)(i), the DPS Group shall provide the Cadbury Group and its officers, agents and personnel all such cooperation, access and assistance, as may reasonably be necessary for the Cadbury Group to comply with any CFC Legislation, including causing the DPS Group to, as soon as reasonably practicable, (i) respond to any CFC Questions asked by CS and its officers, agents and personnel, and (ii) provide CS with copies of any accounts or financial statements or other information in respect of the members of the DPS Group that may be reasonably required or reasonably necessary to enable the Cadbury Group to comply with any CFC Legislation in relation to the DPS Group in respect of any Pre-Demerger Period or Straddle Period (including permitting the Cadbury Group to download any information in respect of accounting systems of the DPS Group for Pre-Demerger Periods and Straddle Periods).
               (iii) With respect to Controladora de Marcas Internacionales, S.A. de C.V. and Adams Mecca B.V., DPS shall deliver to CS, in the case of a Pre-Demerger Period within 45 days following the Demerger Date and in the case of a Straddle Period within 45 days following the end of such Straddle Period, copies or originals of all Tax and accounting data and other information or documents relating to Tax matters of the applicable company for the applicable taxable period. With respect to the prior ownership of preferred shares of Cadbury Aguas Minerales, S.A. de C.V. ("CAMSA") by Cadbury Adams Canada, Inc., DPS agrees to provide CS, within 45 days of a request by CS, with any Tax and accounting data and other information or documents relating to Tax matters of CAMSA that may be reasonably required or reasonably necessary to enable the Cadbury Group to satisfy its Tax compliance obligations or in respect of a Tax Proceeding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any information that is required to be reported (or used to calculate items that are required to be reported) or otherwise disclosed to a Taxing Authority or other governmental entity.
               (iv) DPS agrees to provide CS, within 45 days of a request by CS, with any Tax and accounting data and other information or documents relating to Tax matters of CBCI that may be reasonably required or reasonably necessary to enable the Cadbury Group to satisfy its Tax compliance obligations or in respect of a Tax Proceeding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any information that is required to be reported (or used to calculate items that are required to be reported) or otherwise disclosed to a Taxing Authority or other governmental entity. CS agrees to provide DPS, within 45 days of a request by DPS, with any Tax and accounting data and other information or documents relating to Tax matters of CDMI that may be reasonably required or reasonably necessary to enable the DPS Group to satisfy its Tax compliance obligations or in respect of a Tax Proceeding, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any information that is required to be reported (or used to calculate items that are required to be reported) or otherwise disclosed to a Taxing Authority or other governmental entity.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in this Section 9(b), CS shall have full control over any Tax Proceeding in respect of Cadbury Group Taxes and Taxes indemnified against by CS pursuant to this Agreement including any Tax Proceeding involving the DPS Group or any of its members relating to a Confectionery Transaction or a Specified Entity. CS shall have absolute discretion with respect to any decisions to be made (including choice of counsel, venue or judicial forum), or the nature of any action to be taken, with respect to such Tax Proceeding and the contest thereof (including whether to litigate, compromise or otherwise settle the dispute or contest and the amount of any settlement) and DPS shall cooperate with CS in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 and this Section 9; provided that DPS may, at its own expense, participate in any such Tax Proceeding and CS shall consult with and take reasonable direction from DPS in respect of any decisions to be made or actions to be taken in respect of Tax matters of the DPS Group other than with respect to Cadbury Group Taxes, Confectionery Transactions, one or more Specified Entities or other matters relating to Taxes indemnified against by CS pursuant to this Agreement.
          (c) With respect to Tax Proceedings not described in Section 9(b) but that could result in a right to indemnification for Taxes or Damages by the DPS Group or the Cadbury Group, as the case may be, under this Agreement, the indemnified party shall control the Tax Proceeding and contest the claim indemnified against in good faith as directed by the indemnifying party; provided further that to the extent relating to the claim indemnified against, (i) the indemnified party shall keep the indemnifying party informed of the status and progress of the Tax Proceeding and shall consult with the indemnified party regarding decisions relating to the Tax Proceeding, and (ii) the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

For purposes of the Agreement, the "" of all pension assets shall be the value of such assets as determined in good faith by Cadbury based on all relevant information known to Cadbury at the time of such determination, including the most recent account statements or schedules of asset values provided to Cadbury by any service providers maintaining or overseeing any such assets or any investment vehicles which represent or hold the relevant plan assets. Cadbury shall select the assets to be transferred and provide a schedule of such assets to DPSG 14 days prior to the transfer of such assets.
