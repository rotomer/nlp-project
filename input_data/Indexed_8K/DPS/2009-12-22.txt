Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On December 21, 2009, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. ("DPS") issued an aggregate of $850 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.70% Senior Notes due 2011 (the "2011 Notes") and $450 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.35% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes" and, together with the 2011 Notes, the "Notes") under an Indenture, dated as of December 15, 2009, between DPS and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of December 21, 2009, among DPS, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). Interest on the Notes is payable on June 21 and December 21 of each year, beginning June 21, 2010. The 2011 Notes mature on December 21, 2011 and the 2012 Notes mature on December 21, 2012. The Notes will not be entitled to any sinking fund. The Notes were issued in an underwritten offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net offering proceeds, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were approximately $846.3 million. DPS used net offering proceeds (before deducting estimated offering expenses) to repay debt under our senior unsecured term loan A facility. Affiliates of certain underwriters are lenders under our senior unsecured term loan A credit facility and, accordingly, received a portion of the net proceeds.
          The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of DPS, rank equally with DPS' existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under our senior credit facility, and senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries (except two immaterial subsidiaries associated with our charitable foundations).
          We may redeem the Notes of either series, in whole or in part from time to time, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
      100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed; and
 - 
      the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes being redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), at the Treasury rate plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2011 Notes and 20 basis points in the case of the 2012 Notes,
 - 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
          If a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, subject to certain exceptions, DPS must give holders of the Notes the opportunity to sell to DPS their Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
          The Indenture contains customary events of default, including:
     default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days;
 - 
     default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due;
 - 
     failure by DPS to comply with its obligations under the Indenture, in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods; and
 - 
 
     specified events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of DPS or certain of its subsidiaries.
 - 
          If an event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee may, and at the direction of the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be due and payable, or, in the case of certain events of default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, those amounts will automatically become immediately due and payable.
          DPS and our majority-owned subsidiaries are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture governing the Notes. The Indenture limits the ability of DPS and each of our majority-owned subsidiaries to, among other things:
     incur indebtedness secured by principal properties;
 - 
     enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties; and
 - 
     enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets.
 - 
          Other material terms of the Notes, the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are described in the prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2009, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 15, 2009. The terms and provisions of the Notes and Indenture set forth in his Current Report on Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Base Indenture, Supplemental Indenture, 2011 Note (in global form) and 2012 Note (in global form), which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2, Exhibit 4.3 and Exhibit 4.4, respectively, and each of which is incorporated herein by this reference.

If any Officer of any Guarantor with respect to Securities of any series, whose signature is on the Notation of Guarantee on any Security of such series, no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates any Security or at any time thereafter, the Securities Guarantee of such Security shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Security of a series entitled to the benefits of a Securities Guarantee under this or otherwise established pursuant hereto by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of such Securities Guarantee on behalf of each Guarantor.

plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
