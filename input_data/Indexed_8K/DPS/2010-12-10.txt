Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 10, 2010, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2010, approximately $368 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.82% Senior Notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn as part of its December 1, 2010 cash tender offer (Tender Offer). The Company also announced that it has concluded that it is unlikely that the minimum tender condition with respect to its December 1, 2010 exchange offer (Exchange Offer) will be met so it has cancelled the Exchange Offer. As a result of the cancellation of the Exchange Offer, no 2018 Notes will be accepted for exchange and the Company will not issue any Exchange Notes or make any payment with respect to any 2018 Notes that were tendered in the Exchange Offer. All 2018 Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be promptly returned to their holders. The Company has extended the deadline by which holders of 2 018 Notes may participate in the Tender Offer in order to be eligible to receive the early participation premium to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 14, 2010, unless further extended by the Company (Revised Early Participation Deadline). Previous Exchange Offer participants, as well as all other holders of 2018 Notes, may still tender their 2018 Notes in the Tender Offer. However, withdrawal rights for 2018 Notes tendered in the Tender Offer have not been extended and therefore expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2010. Tenders submitted in the Tender Offer after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 9, 2010 are irrevocable except in the limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law. The Tender Offer continues to be subject to certain other conditions specified in the Companys offering memorandum dated December 1, 2010 and the related letter of transmittal. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Plano, TX, Dec. 10, 2010  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) announced today that as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Dec. 9, 2010, approximately $368 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.82% Senior Notes due 2018 (2018 Notes) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn as part of its Dec. 1, 2010 cash tender offer (Tender Offer).
The company also announced that it has concluded that it is unlikely that the minimum tender condition with respect to its Dec. 1, 2010 exchange offer (Exchange Offer) will be met so it has cancelled the Exchange Offer. As a result of the cancellation of the Exchange Offer, no 2018 Notes will be accepted for exchange and the company will not issue any Exchange Notes or make any payment with respect to any 2018 Notes that were tendered in the Exchange Offer. All 2018 Notes tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be promptly returned to their holders.
The company has extended the deadline by which holders of 2018 Notes may participate in the Tender Offer in order to be eligible to receive the early participation premium to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Dec. 14, 2010, unless further extended by the company (Revised Early Participation Deadline). Previous Exchange Offer participants, as well as all other holders of 2018 Notes, may still tender their 2018 Notes in the Tender Offer. However, withdrawal rights for 2018 Notes tendered in the Tender Offer have not been extended and therefore expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Dec. 9, 2010. Tenders submitted in the Tender Offer after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Dec. 9, 2010 are irrevocable except in the limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law.

This amount, which includes the early participation premium, will be paid in cash.
Holders of 2018 Notes who validly tender their 2018 Notes after the Revised Early Participation Deadline will receive the Total Purchase Consideration, less the early participation premium.
