          On January 11, 2011, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. ("DPS") issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") under an Indenture, dated as of December 15, 2009, between DPS and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of January 11, 2011, among DPS, the guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). Interest on the Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2011. The Notes mature on January 15, 2016. The Notes will not be entitled to any sinking fund. The Notes were issued in an underwritten offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Net offering proceeds, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $496.9 million. The net proceeds replace a portion of the cash used to purchase DPS' 6.82% Senior Notes due 2018 tendered pursuant to our December 1, 2010 cash tender offer, and such proceeds are available for general corporate purposes.
          The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of DPS, rank equally with DPS' existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, including any borrowings under our senior credit facility, and senior to all of our future subordinated debt. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries (except two immaterial subsidiaries associated with our charitable foundations).
          DPS may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part from time to time, at its option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
      100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed; and
 - 
      the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes being redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), at the Treasury rate plus 15 basis points,
 - 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
          If a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, subject to certain exceptions, DPS must give holders of the Notes the opportunity to sell to DPS their Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
          The Indenture contains customary events of default, including:
     default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days;
 - 
     default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due;
 - 
     failure by DPS to comply with its obligations under the Indenture, in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods; and
 - 
     specified events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of DPS or certain of its subsidiaries.
 - 
          If an event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee may, and at the direction of the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes shall, declare the
 
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be due and payable, or, in the case of certain events of default relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, those amounts will automatically become immediately due and payable.
          DPS and our majority-owned subsidiaries are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture governing the Notes. The Indenture limits the ability of DPS and each of our majority-owned subsidiaries to, among other things:
     incur indebtedness secured by principal properties;
 - 
     enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties; and
 - 
     enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets.
 - 
          Other material terms of the Notes, the Base Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture are described in the prospectus supplement, dated January 6, 2011, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7, 2011. The terms and provisions of the Notes and Indenture set forth in this Current Report on Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Base Indenture (filed as Exhibit 4.1 to DPS' Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 23, 2009) and the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (in global form), which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and each of which is incorporated herein by this reference.
          As previously reported, on January 6, 2011, DPS entered into an underwriting agreement with with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC , Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith Incorporated and UBS Securities LLC, as joint bookrunning managers and on behalf of the several underwriters parties thereto, in connection with an underwritten public offering of the Notes.
The disclosure under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 5.1
January 11, 2011
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. 5301 Legacy Drive Plano, Texas 75024-3109
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the issuance by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), of $500,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"), and the issuance by the guarantors named in Schedule I hereto (the "Guarantors") of guarantees of the Notes (the "Guarantees" and, together with the Notes, the "Securities") pursuant to (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-163697) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") on December 14, 2009, and (ii) the related prospectus dated December 14, 2009, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Notes dated January 6, 2011 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act on January 7, 2011, certain legal matters with respect to the Notes are being passed upon for the Company by us. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").
     The Securities are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated December 15, 2009, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture ("the Second Supplemental Indenture"), dated the date hereof (as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
     In our capacity as your counsel in the connection referred to above, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 6, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the several Underwriters named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale of the Securities; (ii) the Indenture, (iii) the global note representing the Notes, (iv) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (v) the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, each as amended to date, (vi) certain corporate records of the Company, including certain resolutions of the Board of Directors and the Capital Transaction Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, as furnished to us by the Company, (vii) certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, (vii) statutes and (ix) other instruments and documents, all as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates, statements or other representations of officers or authorized agents
 
of the Company and of governmental and public officials with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters contained therein or covered thereby.
     In making our examination, we have assumed the due execution and delivery of the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Guarantees, and we have assumed, without independent investigation, that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and complete, that all documents submitted to us as copies are true and correct copies of the originals thereof and that all information submitted to us was accurate and complete.
     In connection with this opinion, we have also assumed that (i) each of the Guarantors is validly existing and in good standing in the jurisdiction in which it was formed and has the full power and authority to execute and deliver the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Guarantees and to perform its obligations thereunder, (ii) all action required to be taken by each of the Guarantors for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery of the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Guarantees and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby has been duly and validly taken, and (iii) the Notes will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.
     On the basis of the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that (i) the Notes will, when duly executed, issued and delivered by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as that the enforcement thereof may be subject to (a) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity and public policy (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (c) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing (collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions"), and (ii) the Guarantees will, when duly executed and delivered by the Guarantors, constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors, enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.
     We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provision in the Indenture, to the extent relating to: (i) any failure to comply with requirements concerning notices, relating to delay or omission to enforce rights or remedies or purporting to waive or affect rights, claims, defenses or other benefits to the extent that any of the same cannot be waived or so affected under applicable law or (ii) indemnities or exculpation from liability to the extent prohibited by federal or state laws and the public policies underlying those laws or that might require indemnification for, or exculpation from liability on account of, negligence, willful misconduct, unlawful acts, fraud or illegality of an indemnified or exculpated party.
     We limit the opinions set forth above in all respects to matters of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the contract law of the State of New York and federal
 
law of the United States, each as in effect on the date hereof, and no opinion is expressed herein as to any matters governed by the law of any other jurisdiction.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
