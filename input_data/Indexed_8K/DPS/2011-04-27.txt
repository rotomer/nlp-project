Exhibit 99.1
DR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
Reported net sales were up 7% for the quarter.
Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.50.
Company reaffirms full year 2011 reported diluted EPS in the $2.70 to $2.78 range.
 
Plano, TX, April 27, 2011 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported first quarter 2011 diluted earnings of $0.50 per share compared to $0.35 per share in the prior year period. Excluding a separation-related foreign deferred tax charge, diluted earnings per share in the prior year period were $0.40.
 
For the quarter, reported net sales increased 7%, reflecting solid volume growth and low-single digit price increases. Revenue recognized under the PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo) and The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) licensing agreements and the favorable impact of repatriated brands added 3 percentage points to net sales growth. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 1% reflecting net sales growth and ongoing supply chain productivity benefits partially offset by higher packaging, ingredient and transportation costs and a $14 million increase in marketing. Foreign currency added one percentage point to net sales and SOP growth. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $202 million compared to $187 million in the prior year period.
 
DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, We're off to a solid start in 2011. The foundational investments we've made to strengthen this business are paying off. Through rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, we're finding even more opportunities to free up resources to support growth. For the period, we increased distribution and availability, introduced exciting new products and expanded Sun Drop nationally. Despite a significant escalation in commodity and fuel costs, we continue to manage this business for the long term, balancing brand growth with pricing, mix and productivity. With solid plans in place and with continued wins in RCI, I am confident we'll deliver our commitments for the year.

Impact of the PepsiCo licensing agreements
In February 2010, the company completed its licensing agreements with PepsiCo. Under these agreements, PepsiCo began distributing Dr Pepper, Crush and Schweppes in the U.S. territories where these brands were previously distributed by The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (PBG) and PepsiAmericas, Inc. (PAS). The same applies to Dr Pepper, Crush, Schweppes, Vernors and Sussex in Canada, and Squirt and Canada Dry in Mexico. These agreements have an initial term of 20 years, with 20-year renewal periods, and require PepsiCo to meet certain performance conditions.
 
Additionally, effective April 2010, in certain U.S. territories where it has a manufacturing and distribution footprint, the company began selling certain owned and licensed brands, including Sunkist soda, Squirt, Vernors and Hawaiian Punch, that were previously distributed by PBG and PAS.
 
The one-time cash payment of $900 million, received in February 2010, was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as net sales over 25 years. The company recognized $9 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $6 million compared to the prior year period.
Impact of the Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements
In October 2010, the company completed its licensing agreements with Coca-Cola. Under the new agreements, Coca-Cola began distributing Dr Pepper in the U.S. and Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S. where they were previously distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). These agreements have an initial term of 20 years, with 20-year renewal periods, and require Coca-Cola to meet certain performance conditions. Coca-Cola will distribute Canada Dry, C'Plus and Schweppes in Canada, will offer Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local fountain accounts previously serviced by CCE and will include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its Freestyle fountain dispenser.
 
Additionally, effective January 2011, in certain U.S. territories where it has a manufacturing and distribution footprint, the company began selling Squirt, Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler, which were previously sold by CCE.
