Beverage Concentrates
Net sales for the quarter were flat. Concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year and revenue recognized under the Coca-Cola licensing agreements added 6 percentage points to growth.

Net sales for the quarter were up 4% reflecting low-single digit price increases and 2 percentage points of growth from brands repatriated under the Coca-Cola licensing agreements. SOP decreased 16% as net sales growth and ongoing supply chain productivity benefits were more than offset by higher packaging, ingredient and transportation costs.

Net sales for the quarter increased 9% reflecting 5% volume growth and favorable product mix. SOP declined 11% as net sales growth was more than offset by higher packaging, ingredient and transportation costs.

2011 full year guidance
The company continues to expect full year reported net sales to increase 3% to 5% and diluted earnings per share to be in the $2.70 to $2.78 range.
Packaging and ingredient costs are expected to increase COGS between 7% and 9% on a constant volume/mix basis. Additionally, the company expects transportation costs to increase selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million.
The tax rate is expected to be approximately 35%, including an $18 million benefit related to the PepsiCo and Coca-Cola transactions.
Finally, the company expects capital spending to be approximately 4.5% of net sales.
Impact of the Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements
In October 2010, the company completed its licensing agreements with Coca-Cola. Under the new agreements, Coca-Cola began distributing Dr Pepper in the U.S. and Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S. where they were previously distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). These agreements have an initial term of 20 years, with 20-year renewal periods, and require Coca-Cola to meet certain performance conditions. Coca-Cola will distribute Canada Dry and C'Plus in Canada, will offer Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local fountain accounts previously serviced by CCE and will include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its Freestyle fountain dispenser.
Additionally, effective January 2011, in certain U.S. territories where it has a manufacturing and distribution footprint, the company began selling Squirt, Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler, which were previously sold by CCE.
The one-time cash payment of $715 million was received in October 2010, was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as net sales over 25 years. The company recognized $7 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2011.
