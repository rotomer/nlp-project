Item 8.01 Other Events.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the "Company") previously disclosed that the Company owns a minority interest in Hydrive Energy, LLC ("Hydrive"). Hydrive, which has developed the energy drink HYDRIVE, is a subsidiary of INOV8 Beverage Company LLC ("INOV8"), which was co-founded by Michael F. Weinstein, one of the Companys directors. Mr. Weinstein owns in excess of forty percent of the equity of INOV8. On September 1, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized management to negotiate the terms of an increase in the equity investment in Hydrive and waived any conflict of interest under the Companys Code of Business Conduct & Ethics (the "Code") that may arise as a result of this additional investment. The amount of the equity investment and the Companys ultimate equity ownership in Hydrive will be determined in the agreement to be negotiated with HYDRIVE by management, but the Board has authorized an investment of up to $2 million, which could increase the Companys equity ownership in Hydrive to approximately 40%. In addition, on September 1, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized management to negotiate an arms' length agreement for the Companys performance of product development services for HYDRIVE to further advance the flavor and functionality of the product. Further, the Board waived any conflict of interest under the Code that may result from the agreement for the services. The Company distributes approximately 90% of HYDRIVE and the above transactions are consistent with the Company's strategy of investing in allied brands.
