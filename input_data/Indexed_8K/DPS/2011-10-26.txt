DR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
Net sales increased 5% for the quarter; reported diluted earnings per share were $0.71.
Year-to-date, the company repurchased $425 million of its common stock.
Full year 2011 reported diluted EPS still expected to be in the $2.70 to $2.78 range.
Plano, TX, Oct. 26, 2011 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported third quarter 2011 diluted earnings of $0.71 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the prior year period. Year-to-date, the company reported earnings of $1.97 per diluted share compared to $1.68 per share in the prior year period. Excluding a separation-related foreign deferred tax charge, diluted earnings per share in the prior year-to-date period were $1.73.
For the quarter, reported net sales increased 5%. Price/mix added approximately 3 percentage points to net sales growth while revenue recognized under The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) licensing agreements and the favorable impact of repatriated brands added approximately 1 percentage point. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 8% as net sales growth, the absence of strike-related costs from the prior year and supply chain productivity and other benefits from rapid continuous improvement more than offset higher packaging and ingredient costs. Foreign currency added 1 percentage point each to net sales and SOP growth. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $261 million, including $11 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on commodity hedging. Reported income from operations was $260 million in the prior year period, including $4 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains.
Year-to-date, reported net sales increased 5% and reported income from operations was $753 million compared to $757 million in the prior year period. Net income was $440 million compared to $416 million in the prior year period.
DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, As we continue to operate in challenging times, I remain pleased with the performance of our portfolio. Our teams are committed to executing our focused strategy with the goal of providing value to our customers while managing price, mix and productivity to offset higher input costs. The national launch of Dr Pepper TEN is bringing excitement and energy to the Dr Pepper trademark, and we are continuing to build per capita consumption with new fountain availabilities

and cold drink placements. Our rapid continuous improvement efforts are gaining traction across the organization, and we're beginning to experience meaningful results.

Beverage Concentrates
Net sales for the quarter increased 5% reflecting low-single digit price increases and revenue recognized under the Coca-Cola licensing agreements, partially offset by the impact of repatriated brands. SOP increased 7% reflecting net sales growth and lower marketing investments.
 
Packaged Beverages
Net sales for the quarter were up 4% reflecting price increases and 1 percentage point of growth from brands repatriated under the Coca-Cola licensing agreements. SOP increased 4% reflecting net sales growth, the absence of $15 million of strike-related costs from the prior year and ongoing supply chain productivity benefits. This was partially offset by higher packaging and ingredient costs.
Latin America Beverages
Net sales for the quarter increased 4% reflecting low-single digit price increases, favorable product mix and 2% volume growth. Net sales growth was partially offset by a $3 million classification change of certain customer transportation allowances previously recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. SOP increased 43% reflecting net sales growth, partially offset by higher packaging, ingredient and transportation costs.
Corporate and other items
For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $82 million, including $11 million of unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market losses. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $63 million including $4 million of unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market gains.

2011 full year guidance
    
The company continues to expect full year reported net sales to increase 3% to 5% and diluted earnings per share to be in the $2.70 to $2.78 range.
Packaging and ingredient costs are expected to increase COGS between 7% and 9% on a constant volume/mix basis. Additionally, the company expects transportation costs to increase selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $35 million.
The tax rate is expected to be approximately 35%, including an $18 million benefit related to the PepsiCo and Coca-Cola transactions.
The company now expects capital spending to be approximately 4% of net sales.
Impact of the Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements
In October 2010, the company completed its licensing agreements with Coca-Cola. Under the new agreements, Coca-Cola began distributing Dr Pepper in the U.S. and Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S. where they were previously distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE). These agreements have an initial term of 20 years, with 20-year renewal periods, and require Coca-Cola to meet certain performance conditions. Coca-Cola will distribute Canada Dry, and C'Plus in Canada, will offer Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in local fountain accounts previously serviced by CCE and will include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper on its Freestyle fountain dispenser.
Additionally, effective January 2011, in certain U.S. territories where it has a manufacturing and distribution footprint, the company began selling Squirt, Canada Dry, Schweppes and Cactus Cooler, which were previously sold by CCE.
The one-time cash payment of $715 million was received in October 2010, was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as net sales over 25 years. The company recognized $7 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2011.
