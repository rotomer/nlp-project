DR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Net sales were up 2% for the quarter.
Reported EPS were $0.48.
Year-to-date, the company repurchased $85 million of its common stock.
Company reaffirms full year 2012 Core EPS in the $2.90 to $2.98 range.
Plano, TX, April 25, 2012 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported first quarter 2012 EPS of $0.48 compared to $0.50 in the prior year period. Excluding $0.02 per share of unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains, Core EPS were $0.46 compared to $0.50 in the prior period.
For the quarter, reported net sales increased 2% reflecting 4 percentage points of price/mix, partially offset by lower branded volumes, a reclassification of certain customer transportation allowances that were previously recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses and foreign currency translation. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) decreased 4%, or $12 million, as the benefits of higher sales and productivity improvements were more than offset by higher packaging and ingredient costs, other operating cost increases and higher marketing investments of $8 million. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $192 million including $6 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains. Reported income from operations was $202 million in the prior year period including $2 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains.
DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, Despite expected commodity headwinds and higher pricing across our CSD brands and Hawaiian Punch and Mott's trademarks, our business continued to perform well in the quarter, and consistent with our expectations. We outperformed the industry in both volume and dollar share in both the CSD and Tea categories. Now in its second year, Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) is delivering results for our customers and in our financial performance. With solid marketing plans in place for the remainder of the year and RCI further expanding across the organization, I remain confident in our plans for the year.

In NCBs, Hawaiian Punch volume declined 21% and Mott's volume declined 16% due to cycling price increases that were taken in mid-year 2011. Clamato increased 27% and Snapple volume grew 5%, cycling 10% growth in the prior year period.

2
Beverage Concentrates
Net sales for the quarter were flat as 4 percentage points of concentrate pricing were offset by a 3% volume decline and higher discounts. SOP decreased 10% principally due to increased marketing investments and higher ingredient costs.
Packaged Beverages
Net sales for the quarter were up 3% reflecting favorable mix and 2 percentage points of pricing, partially offset by the reclassification of certain customer transportation allowances that were previously recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. SOP increased 3% as the benefits of higher sales were partially offset by cost inflation in packaging and ingredients and other operating costs.
Latin America Beverages
Net sales for the quarter increased 6% reflecting favorable product mix and a 4% increase in volume. Net sales growth was partially offset by the reclassification of certain customer transportation allowances that were previously recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. SOP increased 60% reflecting net sales growth and favorable operating leverage, partially offset by higher packaging, ingredient and manufacturing costs.
Corporate and other items
For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $65 million, including $6 million of unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market gains. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $67 million, including $2 million of unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market gains.
Net interest expense increased $6 million compared to the prior year, as the company re-financed low floating rate debt in November 2011.
For the quarter, the effective tax rate was 37.4% compared to 36.0% last year, as last year's rate included certain one-time tax benefits related to the PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements.
Cash flow
For the quarter, the company used $325 million of cash in operating activities, which included the payment of $508 million in taxes related to the PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements.

Definitions
Bottler case sales (BCS) volume: Sales of finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by the company and its bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors and excludes contract manufacturing volume. Volume for products sold by the company and its bottling partners is reported on a monthly basis, with the first quarter comprising January, February and March.
Sales volume: Sales of concentrates and finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, shipped by the company to its bottlers, retailers and independent distributors and includes contract manufacturing volume.
Pricing refers to the impact of list price changes.
Unrealized mark-to-market: We recognize the change in the fair value of open commodity derivative positions between periods in corporate unallocated expenses, as these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As the underlying commodity is delivered, the realized gains and losses are subsequently reflected in the segment results.
EPS represents diluted earnings per share.
Core EPS is defined as EPS adjusted for the unrealized mark-to-market impact of commodity derivatives and certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods.
