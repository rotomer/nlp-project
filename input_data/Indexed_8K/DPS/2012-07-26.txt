EXHIBIT INDEX

DR PEPPER SNAPPLE GROUP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Net sales increased 2% for the quarter.
Reported EPS were $0.83. Core EPS were $0.85.
Year-to-date, the company repurchased $152 million of its common stock.
Company reaffirms full year 2012 Core EPS in the $2.90 to $2.98 range.
Plano, TX, July 26, 2012 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported second quarter 2012 EPS of $0.83 compared to $0.77 in the prior year period. Excluding unrealized commodity mark-to-market losses in both years and certain items affecting comparability in the current year, Core EPS were $0.85 compared to $0.78 in the prior year period. Year-to-date, the company reported earnings of $1.31 per diluted share compared to $1.27 per share in the prior year period. Excluding certain items affecting comparability in the current year and unrealized commodity mark-to-market losses in both years, Core EPS were $1.31 compared to $1.28 in the prior year period.
For the quarter, reported net sales increased 2%
reflecting 4 percentage points of price/mix and lower discounts, partially offset by lower volumes and a 2% foreign currency impact. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 2%, or $7 million, as the contributions from net sales growth and productivity improvements were partially offset by higher packaging and ingredient costs, certain increases in labor and benefits, a $9 million increase in marketing investments and an $8 million pre-separation-related non-cash charge recorded in the current period. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $300 million compared to $290 million in the prior year period, including $7 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses in both years.
Year-to-date, reported net sales increased 2% and reported income from operations was $492 million, flat to the prior year period.
DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, As we wrap up the first half of the year, I am pleased with the continued performance of our well-loved brands and the passion of our people as they continue to execute against our strategy and embrace Rapid Continuous Improvement as a way of doing business. We once again outperformed the category in CSDs, growing both volume and dollar share, and made progress against our goals of increasing distribution and availability, with solid gains across both grocery and convenience in CSDs and tea. And we continued to invest in our brands to ensure we are always providing value to our customers and our consumers.

EPS - earnings per share
Net sales and SOP in the tables and commentary below are presented on a currency neutral basis. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures see pages A-5 and A-6 accompanying this release.
BCS - bottler case sales
BCS Volume
For the quarter, BCS volume declined 1% with carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) flat and non-carbonated beverages (NCBs) declining 6%.
In CSDs, Dr Pepper volume increased 1% driven primarily by Dr Pepper TEN and continued growth in fountain foodservice. Our Core 5 brands grew 1% driven primarily by mid-single digit increases in Canada Dry and A&W that were partially offset by a double digit decrease in Sun Drop and a low-single digit decline in 7UP. All other CSD brands declined 2% driven primarily by a high-single digit decrease in Crush. Fountain foodservice volume grew 3%, cycling 4% volume growth in the prior year period.
In NCBs, Hawaiian Punch volume declined 20% and Mott's volume declined 2% due to cycling price increases that were taken in mid-year 2011. These declines were partially offset by an 8% increase in Clamato and a 1% increase in Snapple, which was cycling 8% growth in the prior year period.
By geography, U.S. and Canada volume declined 1% and Mexico and the Caribbean volume declined 2%.
Sales volume
For the quarter, sales volume decreased 1%. Branded volume declined 2%, while contract manufacturing volume increased.
2
Beverage Concentrates
Net sales for the quarter increased 3% as concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year, lower discounts and favorable mix were partially offset by a 2% volume decline. SOP decreased 1% principally due to increased marketing investments of $8 million and higher ingredient costs.
 
Packaged Beverages
Net sales for the quarter were up 4% reflecting favorable mix and higher pricing including lower discounts, partially offset by a decrease in branded sales volumes. SOP increased 9% as the benefits of higher sales and productivity improvements were partially offset by cost inflation in packaging and ingredients and labor and benefits. SOP was further reduced by an $8 million depreciation adjustment associated with the reassessment of a capital lease executed prior to separation.
Latin America Beverages
Net sales for the quarter increased 1% reflecting favorable product mix and higher pricing, partially offset by the reclassification of certain customer transportation allowances that were previously recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses and a 2% volume decline. SOP was flat as net sales growth was offset by higher packaging and ingredient costs.
3
Corporate and other items
For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $77 million compared to $81 million in the prior year period. Unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market losses were $7 million in both years.
Net interest expense increased $2 million compared to the prior year, as the company refinanced low floating rate debt in November 2011.
For the quarter, the effective tax rate was 34.3% compared to 35.5% in the prior year period, due primarily to a $4 million Canadian deferred tax benefit recorded in the current year.
Cash flow
Year-to-date, the company used $41 million of cash from operating activities, including total tax payments of $531 million related to the PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company licensing agreements. Capital spending totaled $89 million compared to $104 million in the prior year period. The company returned $293 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases ($152 million) and dividends ($141 million).
2012 full year guidance
    
The company continues to expect full year reported net sales growth near the low end of its long-term 3% to 5% range and Core EPS to be in the $2.90 to $2.98 range.
Packaging and ingredient costs are now expected to increase COGS 2% on a constant volume/mix basis.
The company continues to expect its tax rate to be approximately 37% and capital spending to be approximately 4% of net sales.
Definitions
Bottler case sales (BCS) volume: Sales of finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by the company and its bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors and excludes contract manufacturing volume. Volume for products sold by the company and its bottling partners is reported on a monthly basis, with the second quarter comprising April, May
    
and June.
Sales volume: Sales of concentrates and finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, shipped by the company to its bottlers, retailers and independent distributors and includes contract manufacturing volume.
Pricing refers to the impact of list price changes.
Unrealized mark-to-market: We recognize the change in the fair value of open commodity derivative positions between periods in corporate unallocated expenses, as these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As the underlying commodity is delivered, the realized gains and losses are subsequently reflected in the segment results.
EPS represents diluted earnings per share.
Core EPS is defined as EPS adjusted for the unrealized mark-to-market impact of commodity derivatives and certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods.
