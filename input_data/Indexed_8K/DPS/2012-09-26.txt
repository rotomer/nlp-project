Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.03 of this Report is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Item 1.02   Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 25, 2012, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the "Company") terminated its five-year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 11, 2008,  by and among the Company, the lenders and issuing bank party thereto,  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent thereunder, and the other parties thereto (the "Prior Credit Agreement").  The Prior Credit Agreement was to mature on April 11, 2013, but was terminated in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement identified in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Item 2.03      Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On September 25, 2012, the Company entered into a new five-year unsecured Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the Lenders and Issuing Banks party thereto; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as Syndication Agents, and Branch Banking and Trust Company, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., Morgan Senior Funding, Inc., UBS Securities LLC and U.S. Bank National Association, as Co-Documentation Agents.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million revolving line of credit, with a $75 million letter of credit sublimit and a $50 million swingline advance sublimit.  The Credit Agreement further provides that the Company may request at any time, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that the aggregate commitments under the facility be increased by a total amount not to exceed $250 million. Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement will generally accrue interest at a rate, at the election of the Company, equal to (i) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin or (ii) adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on a pricing grid tied to the credit ratings of the Company assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.  Swingline advances will accrue interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate plus the applicable margin.
 
The Credit Agreement's representations, warranties, covenants and events of default are generally customary for investment grade credit and includes a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt (as defined) to annualized consolidated EBITDA (as defined) of no more than 3.00 to 1.00, tested quarterly.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default, among other things, amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated.  As was the case with the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries on the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of September 25, 2017; however, the Company, with the consent of lenders holding more than 50% of the total commitments under the Credit Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, may extend the maturity date for up to two additional one-year terms.
 
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, many of the lenders or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, advisory, lending and/or commercial banking or other financial services for the Company for which they received, or may receive, customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.
 
A copy of the Credit Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The summary of the Credit Agreement in this Item 2.03 is qualified entirely by the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.17
                                           
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
.  (a)  The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that
 
payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
 
(b)
                                
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c)
                                 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d)
                                
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)
                                 
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its
 
discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof) (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.18
                                           
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.  (a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay Indemnified Taxes or any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)
                                
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination requiring the consent of all the Lenders or all affected Lenders, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of any Lender whose consent is required is not obtained, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 or pursuant to procedures agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), all its interests, rights (other than its rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 or Section 9.03 arising prior to the effectiveness of such assignment) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent with respect to any assignee that is not already a Lender hereunder (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks) which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

(c)
                                 
if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)
                                    
all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated (effective as of the date such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;
 
(ii)
                                 
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Banks only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
 
(iii)
                              
if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv)
                             
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's reallocated LC Exposure shall be payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v)
                                
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and Letter of Credit participation fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Banks, ratably based on the portion of such LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank, until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above; and
 
(d)
                                
so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender is satisfied that the related exposure in respect of Swingline Loans, and such Issuing Bank is satisfied that the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure, will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and, to the extent such 100% coverage is not achieved, by cash collateral which will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
(e)
                                 
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit (such Lender referenced in clauses (i) and (ii), a ""), the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender is satisfied that the related exposure in respect of Swingline Loans, and such Issuing Bank is satisfied that the Disregarded Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure, will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Disregarded Lenders and, to the extent such 100% coverage is not achieved, by cash collateral which will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Disregarded Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c) (and such Disregarded Lender shall not participate therein).

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
 
(g)
                                
The rights and remedies against, and with respect to, a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.19 are in addition to, and cumulative and not in limitation of, all other rights and remedies that the Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or the Borrower or any other Loan Party may have at any time against, or with respect to, such Defaulting Lender.
