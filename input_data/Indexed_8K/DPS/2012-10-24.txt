- Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported
third
quarter
2012
EPS of $0.84 compared to $0.71 in the prior year period. Excluding $18 million of unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains in the current year and $11 million of unrealized commodity mark-to-market losses in the prior year period, Core EPS were $0.79 compared to $0.74 in the prior year. Year-to-date, the company reported earnings of $2.15 per diluted share compared to $1.97 per diluted share in the prior year period. Excluding certain items affecting comparability and an unrealized commodity mark-to-market gain in the current year and a $16 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss in the prior year period, Core EPS were $2.10 compared to $2.02 in the prior year period.
For the quarter, reported net sales were flat. Shipment volumes were down 3%. Product and package price/mix was up 4%, while volume mix shift across the segments lowered net sales by 1%. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 3%, or $10 million, as the contributions from favorable price/mix were partially offset by lower volumes and a $9 million increase in marketing investments. Foreign currency reduced net sales by less than 1% in the quarter and lowered SOP by 1 percentage point. Reported income from operations for the quarter was $308 million, including $18 million of unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains. Reported income from operations was $261 million in the prior year period, including $11 million of unrealized commodity mark-to-market losses.

DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, We continue to operate in an uncertain economic and cautious consumer environment. I am proud of the team's commitment to execute our focused strategy of driving profitable volume through disciplined pricing and continued investment in our brands to drive relevance and awareness with our consumers. Rapid continuous improvement (RCI) is gaining
1
momentum across the organization and is delivering improvements in operating profitability and cash flow, resulting in returns for our shareholders.
EPS - earnings per share
Net sales and SOP in the tables and commentary below are presented on a currency neutral basis. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures see pages A-5 through A-9 accompanying this release.
BCS - bottler case sales
BCS Volume
For the quarter, BCS volume declined 3% with carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) declining 2% and non-carbonated beverages (NCBs) declining 5%.
In CSDs, Dr Pepper volume decreased 1% driven primarily by declines in the base business, partially offset by growth of Dr Pepper TEN and continued fountain availabilities. Our Core 5 brands declined 6% on higher retail pricing and lower promotional activity. 7UP and Sunkist soda both experienced a high-single digit decline, while A&W experienced a mid-single digit decline and Sun Drop experienced a double-digit decline. These declines were partially offset by a mid-single digit increase in Canada Dry, which was cycling a double-digit increase in the prior year period. Fountain foodservice volume grew 2%, cycling 4% volume growth in the prior year.
In NCBs, Hawaiian Punch volume declined 14% on retail price increases and Mott's volume declined 10% due to lower promotional activity. These declines were partially offset by a 4% increase in Snapple.
By geography, U.S. and Canada volume declined 3% and Mexico and the Caribbean volume increased 1%.
Sales volume
For the quarter, sales volume decreased 3%. Branded volume declined 3%, while contract manufacturing
2
volume decreased by 6%.
Beverage Concentrates
Net sales for the quarter increased 4% as concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year, lower discounts and favorable mix were partially offset by a 2% volume decline. SOP increased 1% as the benefits of net sales growth were partially offset by increased marketing investments of $7 million and higher ingredient costs.
 
Packaged Beverages
Net sales for the quarter decreased 1% as a 6% volume decline was partially offset by favorable mix, price increases and lower discounts. SOP increased 4% as the benefits of price increases, favorable mix and ongoing RCI productivity improvements were partially offset by lower sales volumes, certain increases in labor and benefits costs, a higher LIFO charge of $4 million primarily associated with the increased cost of apples and increased marketing expense of $3 million.
Latin America Beverages
Net sales for the quarter increased 7% reflecting favorable product mix, higher pricing and a 1% increase in sales volumes. SOP increased 133% reflecting net sales growth and favorable operating leverage from ongoing RCI productivity improvements.
3
Corporate and other items
For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $47 million, including $18 million of unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $82 million, including an $11 million unrealized commodity mark-to-market loss.
Net interest expense increased $2 million compared to the prior year, as the company refinanced low floating rate debt in November 2011.
For the quarter, the effective tax rate was 36.3% compared to 34.7% in the prior year period, which included a $5 million benefit related to the PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo) and The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) transactions.

Definitions
Bottler case sales (BCS) volume: Sales of finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by the company and its bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors and excludes contract manufacturing volume. Volume for products sold by the company and its bottling partners is reported on a monthly basis, with the third quarter comprising July, August and September.
Sales volume: Sales of concentrates and finished beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, shipped by the company to its bottlers, retailers and independent distributors and includes contract manufacturing volume.
Pricing refers to the impact of list price changes.
Unrealized mark-to-market: We recognize the change in the fair value of open commodity derivative positions between periods in corporate unallocated expenses, as these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As the underlying commodity is delivered, the realized gains and losses are subsequently reflected in the segment results.
EPS represents diluted earnings per share.

Core EPS is defined as EPS adjusted for the unrealized mark-to-market impact of commodity derivatives and certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods.
