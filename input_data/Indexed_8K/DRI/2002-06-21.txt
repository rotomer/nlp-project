Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-5550 (Media) Rick Walsh (407) 245-5366 FOR RELEASE June 20, 2002 4:30 PM EDT DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS RECORD ANNUAL AND RECORD FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE ORLANDO, FL - June 20 -- Darden Restaurants, Inc. today reported record earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year and fiscal fourth quarter ended May 26, 2002. Earnings per diluted share were $1.30 for the year on earnings after tax of $237.8 million, and 40 cents for the fourth quarter on earnings after tax of $72.9 million. Excluding unusual restructuring credits in the second and fourth quarters, earnings per diluted share were $1.29 for the year, a 22% increase over the prior year, and 40 cents for the fourth quarter, a 21% increase. Darden, the world's largest casual dining company, said full year sales increased over 9% to $4.4 billion. Fourth quarter sales increased over 8% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable-restaurant sales gains at Red Lobster and Olive Garden that again exceeded the casual dining industry average as measured by Knapp-Track. Sales for all reporting periods have been adjusted to reflect recently adopted accounting rules, which require that sales incentives such as coupons and discounts be recorded as reductions to sales rather than marketing expenses. All earnings per share results and outstanding shares have been adjusted to reflect the 3 for 2 stock split in the form of a 50% share dividend that was paid on May 1, 2002 for shareholders of record as of April 10, 2002. "This was another year of strong performance at Darden Restaurants, capped off by an outstanding fourth quarter," said Joe R. Lee, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We prepared well for the economic softness that existed for much of the year, with effective strategies that included an even stronger focus on operating excellence as well as attractive advertising and appealing promotions. And, in a year marked by unimaginable loss in our nation, the people of Darden Restaurants were great sources of support to our guests, to our friends and neighbors and to one another. Their spirit of service, our trusted brands and our powerful combination of leadership breadth and financial strength give me confidence we will achieve our vision of being the best in casual dining, now and for generations." Highlights for the year and quarter ended May 26, 2002, include the following: o Earnings after tax were $237.8 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for the fiscal year, and $72.9 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, for the fourth quarter. These results include unusual items totaling approximately $1.6 million after-tax, which include after-tax restructuring credits of $1.4 million in the second quarter and $184,000 in the fourth quarter. The credits reflect the reversal of a portion of the Company's fiscal 1997 restructuring reserve, primarily because of favorable lease terminations. -MORE-

Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S fourth quarter sales of $484.3 million were 9.6% above prior year; driven by a 5.3% same-restaurant sales increase and increased revenues from 19 new restaurants opened in fiscal 2002. This is the 31st consecutive quarter of comparable-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden, and builds on a 7.1% increase in the fourth quarter last year. Olive Garden's total sales for the fiscal year were $1.86 billion, up 9.5% from the prior year, and its annual average sales per restaurant increased to $3.9 million - both record levels. Olive Garden had a double-digit percentage increase in operating profit for the 7th consecutive fiscal year, reaching a new high in operating profit as well. "It was another rewarding year for our company," said Drew Madsen, President of Olive Garden. "The Olive Garden guest experience has never been stronger, and this operating excellence is supported by solid marketing that continues to build the brand and fuel guest count growth. Our team keeps demonstrating the power of providing our guests with a genuine Italian dining experience, which we define as fresh, simple, delicious Italian food, accompanied by great wine in a home-like Italian setting, where you're treated like family." RED LOBSTER'S fourth quarter sales of $626.9 million were 5.2% above prior year, propelled by a 3.7% same-restaurant sales increase. This 18th consecutive quarter of growth comes on top of Red Lobster's 3.8% same-restaurant sales increase in last year's fourth quarter. Total sales of $2.34 billion for the fiscal year were 7.1% above last year and average sales per restaurant for the year were $3.5 million - record levels for Red Lobster. Operating profit for the fiscal year increased at a double-digit percentage rate and established a new record for Red Lobster. -MORE-

"In our 34th year, Red Lobster remains a trusted brand; and we're strengthening our brand with significant improvements in our look, our culinary and beverage offerings and our service. A key element is the stability, expertise and commitment of our crew. Inspired by a passion for providing hospitality you can taste and touch, they are delivering to our guests a fresh approach to casual dining with great seafood, good times and hospitality." BAHAMA BREEZE opened three restaurants during the quarter bringing the total number in operation to 29 restaurants. The latest restaurants are located in Indianapolis, Las Colinas (Dallas, TX) and Schaumburg (Chicago, IL).
