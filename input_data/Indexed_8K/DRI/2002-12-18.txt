EXHIBIT 99 DARDEN RESTAURANTS Red Lobster(R)Olive Garden(R)Bahama Breeze(R)Smokey Bones(R) WWW.DARDEN.COM NEWS/INFORMATION Corporate Relations P.O. Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-5550 (Media) Jim DeSimone (407)245-5192 FOR RELEASE December 17, 2002 4:30 PM EST DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS DOUBLE-DIGIT SECOND QUARTER EPS GROWTH ORLANDO, FL., Dec. 17 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. today reported record quarterly sales of $1.07 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended November 24, 2002, and that earnings per diluted share also reached a new quarterly high of 21 cents, an 11% increase from prior year, excluding an unusual restructuring credit last year. "We held up well this quarter despite difficult conditions, but there was more variability than we would have liked," said Joe Lee, Darden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While Olive Garden achieved record levels of performance for the quarter, Red Lobster's results during the first two months were softer than expected. However, Red Lobster did experience very strong sales growth in the final month, and we're encouraged by the renewed momentum. Fundamentals of the business, such as guest satisfaction and employee retention trends, remain strong and we believe Darden is well-positioned to achieve solid, consistent growth this fiscal year and for the long-term." Highlights for the quarter ended November 24, 2002, included the following: o Earnings after tax in the second quarter were $37.5 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.07 billion. Last year, earnings after tax before an unusual restructuring credit were $35.1 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.01 billion. o Total sales of $1.07 billion for the quarter represent a 6.4% increase over prior year, and establish a new second quarter record for Darden. o Olive Garden led the Company with a 3.5% increase in same-restaurant sales, its 33rd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. o Red Lobster reported its 20th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth with a 2.3% increase. -MORE-
-2- o Same-restaurant sales results for Red Lobster and Olive Garden benefited by approximately one percentage point this quarter from a shift in the Thanksgiving holiday. Both companies close for the holiday, which was not in Darden's fiscal second quarter this year while it did occur in the second quarter last year. o Bahama Breeze opened two new restaurants during the quarter, bringing its total number of restaurants to 32. o Smokey Bones opened six new restaurants during the quarter, bringing the total number of restaurants it operates to 27. o The Company continued its share repurchase program, buying back 1.2 million shares of its common stock in the quarter. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S second quarter sales of $472.7 million were a 7.2% increase from the prior year due to its same-restaurant sales growth and its having 23 more restaurants in operation than the prior year. With the company's 3.5% gain, Olive Garden achieved its 33rd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth and opened 11 restaurants during the quarter, the most since 1995. The increased sales, combined with lower food and beverage expense and restaurant labor costs as a percent of sales, resulted in record quarterly operating profit that also represents a strong double-digit increase over last year. "It was another successful quarter at Olive Garden," said Drew Madsen, President of Olive Garden. "The focus on operating excellence and strong branding led to same-restaurant sales growth that was again ahead of the casual dining industry average. Guests continued to be motivated by our promise of a genuine Italian dining experience featuring fresh, simple and delicious Italian food, accompanied by a great glass of wine, in a home-like Italian setting where everyone is treated like family. And, our teams continued to deliver on that promise throughout the company." RED LOBSTER'S second quarter sales of $549.2 million were 3.5% above prior year, driven primarily by its 2.3% increase in same-restaurant sales, which extended Red Lobster's string of comparable sales gains to 20 consecutive quarters. Red Lobster enjoyed strong November sales growth, partially offsetting the sales softness it experienced during September and October. Due to the combination of lower than expected sales growth and a value-oriented marketing calendar during the first two months of the quarter, Red Lobster's restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses each increased as a percent of sales. As a result, its operating profit declined versus last year. -MORE-
-3- "We finished the quarter strongly, with a very good November," said Edna Morris, President of Red Lobster. "We did so by building upon the improving operating excellence of our crew with an appealing, effectively advertised entree feature after a disappointing marketing feature the previous two months. Our ability to quickly reverse unfavorable sales trends underscores Red Lobster's many competitive advantages, including the quality of our crew and the fundamental strength of our brand and operations." BAHAMA BREEZE opened two new restaurants during the quarter, one in Sunrise, FL and the other in Chesterfield, MO, bringing the year-to-date total to three openings. Three more openings are scheduled for this fiscal year. SMOKEY BONES opened six new restaurants during the quarter. In addition, two more restaurants have opened since the end of the quarter, one in Dunwoody, GA and the other in Duluth, GA. In fiscal year 2003, at least 20 restaurants are expected to open, more than doubling the number open at the end of fiscal 2002. Other Actions After the end of the second quarter, Darden announced that it will begin the next phase of testing for a new restaurant called Seasons 52(SM). It is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering the freshest ingredients to create great tasting entrees that are nutritionally balanced and lower in calories. Seasons 52(SM) is currently under construction and is scheduled to open in Orlando, FL, in Darden's fiscal third quarter. Darden continued its buyback of common stock, purchasing 1.2 million shares in the second quarter. Cumulatively, since the initial authorization of its repurchase program in December 1995, the Company has repurchased 91.0 million shares, and it has approximately 24.4 million shares remaining under current authorizations. November 2002 Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden also reported same-restaurant sales for the four-week November fiscal month ended November 24, 2002. This period is the last month of the Company's fiscal 2003 second quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster were up 10% to 11% for the month, which reflected a 5% to 6% increase in guest traffic and a 4% to 5% increase in check average. The check average increase was due to a 1% to 2% increase in pricing and a 2% to 3% increase from menu mix changes. Red Lobster's fiscal November 2003 results include the final week of the "30-Shrimp for $9.99" promotion that started on September 9 and ended on November 3, as well as three weeks of a "Lobster and Shrimp" feature. During fiscal November of last year, the "30-Shrimp for $9.99" promotion ran for three weeks, followed by one week without any advertising, and Red Lobster had a 6% to 7% same-restaurant sales increase. -MORE-
-4- Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up approximately 3% for the month, and that reflected a 4% increase in check average and a 1% decline in guest traffic. The check average increase was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 1% to 2% increase from menu mix changes. This fiscal November, Olive Garden had four weeks of advertising featuring "Chicken Marsala". During fiscal November of last year, "Chicken Marsala" was featured concurrently with "Soup and Salad" advertising for three weeks followed by one week without any advertising. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden during November last year increased 8% to 9%. This year's shift of the Thanksgiving holiday from fiscal November to fiscal December favorably affected November same-restaurant sales results at both Red Lobster and Olive Garden by approximately three percentage points. Fiscal December results will be adversely affected by a similar amount as a result of the calendar shift. Darden Restaurants, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates over 1,200 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones restaurants with annual sales of $4.4 billion.
