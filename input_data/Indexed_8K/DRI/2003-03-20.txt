EXHIBIT 99 DARDEN RESTAURANTS Red Lobster(R)Olive Garden(R)Bahama Breeze(R)Smokey Bones(R) www.darden.com NEWS/INFORMATION Corporate Relations P.O. Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Jim DeSimone (407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE March 20, 2003 4:30 PM EST DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 35 CENTS ORLANDO, FL., Mar. 20 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. today reported record quarterly sales of $1.18 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended February 23, 2003, and earnings per diluted share of 35 cents, a 3% decline from prior year. "We are disappointed with our performance this quarter," said Joe Lee, Darden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved strong sales and profit growth last year, and some of the actions we took to build on this performance, did not meet expectations. Unanticipated workers' compensation and public liability expenses and severe weather also adversely affected our performance. We are re-focusing the efforts of all of our companies on the keys to sustained long-term success - brilliance with the basics of operations, and brand building excellence. Our goals are to deliver delicious food and exceptional service to our guests in a warm and friendly atmosphere; this will reinforce their emotional connection to and trust in our terrific combination of proven and emerging brands. This is the path to once again create industry-leading shareholder value and achieve our goal of being the best in casual dining, now and for generations." Highlights for the quarter ended February 23, 2003, included the following: o Earnings after tax in the third quarter were $61.8 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.18 billion. Last year, earnings after tax were $66.2 million, or 36 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.12 billion. o Total sales of $1.18 billion for the quarter represent a 5.1% increase over prior year, and establish a new third quarter record for Darden. o Red Lobster reported its 21st consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth with a 1.2% increase. o Olive Garden reported its 34th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth with a 0.3% increase.
-MORE- -2- o Same-restaurant sales results for Red Lobster and Olive Garden would have been approximately two percentage points higher this quarter but were adversely affected by two factors - a shift in the Thanksgiving holiday, which was observed in Darden's fiscal third quarter this year but in the second quarter last year, and more severe winter weather than last year. Each factor impacted sales by approximately one percentage point. o Earnings results were also negatively impacted by unanticipated worker's compensation and insurance costs, higher than expected utility expense, increased marketing expense in response to the challenging economic and competitive environment and higher incremental pre-opening expense versus prior year due to an increase in new restaurant openings. o The Company continued its share repurchase program, buying back 1.7 million shares of its common stock in the quarter. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S third quarter sales grew 5.7% from prior year to $505.4 million, driven primarily by its 28 net new restaurants in operation versus last year. Olive Garden achieved its 34th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth with a 0.3% increase on top of last year's 9.8% same-restaurant sales growth. Nine new restaurants with Olive Garden's Tuscan Farmhouse design were opened during the quarter. The company's sales, a third quarter record, combined with lower food and beverage expense and restaurant labor costs as a percent of sales, to more than offset increased restaurant and marketing expense to deliver record third quarter operating profit. "We achieved solid growth in total sales and operating profit in a difficult environment," said Drew Madsen, President of Olive Garden. "Severe winter weather and a weak economy hindered our same restaurant sales growth, but our team stayed focused on delivering a great guest experience, brand building innovation and balanced cost management to produce strong financial results for the quarter. Our promise of providing a genuine Italian dining experience continues to resonate with our guests and differentiate us from our competitors." RED LOBSTER'S third quarter sales of $620.6 million were a 2.3% increase from the prior year, driven by nine additional restaurants in operation versus prior year and a 1.2% increase in same-restaurant sales. The increase extended Red Lobster's string of comparable sales gains to 21 consecutive quarters. However, Red Lobster's total sales were lower than planned. As a result, restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses each increased as a percent of sales, leading to a decline in operating profit versus last year. "We are disappointed with our performance this quarter," said Edna Morris, President of Red Lobster. "It was a challenging period with tough comparisons from prior year and many of our investments did not produce the results we anticipated. However, our crews continue to deliver outstanding food and hospitality to our guests and external measures show the dining experience continues to improve. The fundamental strength of our brand and quality of our crew demonstrates we have the necessary tools to help us achieve solid sales and operating profit growth in the future."
-MORE- -3- BAHAMA BREEZE has opened three restaurants this fiscal year and two more restaurants, located in Cleveland and Seattle, are scheduled to open during the fourth quarter. SMOKEY BONES opened seven new restaurants during the quarter. In addition, two more restaurants have opened since the end of the quarter, one in Boca Raton and the other in Indianapolis. Year-to-date, Smokey Bones has opened 17 new restaurants. In fiscal year 2003, at least 20 restaurants are expected to open, more than doubling the number open at the end of fiscal 2002. Other Actions The Board of Directors also today declared a regular semi-annual cash dividend of 4 cents per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2003 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 10, 2003. Darden continued its buyback of common stock, purchasing 1.7 million shares in the third quarter. Cumulatively, since the initial authorization of its repurchase program in December 1995, the Company has repurchased 92.7 million shares, and it has approximately 22.7 million shares remaining under current authorizations. After the end of the third quarter, Darden opened a new test restaurant in Orlando called Seasons 52(SM). It is a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering the freshest ingredients to create great tasting, nutritionally balanced entrees that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. February 2003 Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden also reported same-restaurant sales for the four-week February fiscal month ended February 23, 2003. This period is the last month of the Company's fiscal 2003 third quarter. February's sales and traffic at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster were affected adversely by approximately 2.5 percentage points as a result of more severe weather than last year across much of the nation. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up 1% for the month, reflecting a 3% to 4% increase in check average and a 2% to 3% decline in guest traffic. The check average increase was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1% increase from menu mix changes. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden during February last year increased 6% to 7%. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up 1% for the month, reflecting a 3% to 4% increase in check average and a 2% to 3% decline in guest traffic.
