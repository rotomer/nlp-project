EXHIBIT 99 DARDEN RESTAURANTS Red Lobster(R)Olive Garden(R)Bahama Breeze(R)Smokey Bones(R) www.darden.com NEWS/INFORMATION Corporate Relations P.O. Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Jim DeSimone (407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE April 29, 2003 4:30 PM EDT DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS APRIL SAME-RESTAURANT SALES RESULTS ORLANDO, FL - Darden Restaurants, Inc., (NYSE: DRI) today reported same-restaurant sales results for the four-week April fiscal month ended April 27, 2003. This period is the second month of Darden's fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster were up 0% to 1% for fiscal April, which reflected a 2% to 3% increase in check average and a 2% to 3% decrease in guest counts. The check average increase was a result of a 1% to 2% increase in pricing and a 1% to 2% increase from menu mix changes. Last year, Red Lobster had a 4% to 5% increase in same-restaurant sales during fiscal April. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were down 0% to 1% for fiscal April, which reflected a 3% to 4% increase in check average and a 4% to 5% decline in guest counts. The check average increase was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1% increase from menu mix changes. Last year, Olive Garden had a 9% to 10% increase in same-restaurant sales during fiscal April. "We expected stronger same-restaurant sales in April," said Linda Dimopoulos, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. "As a result of the April softness, we now anticipate combined same-restaurant sales for the full fiscal year to be between 2% to 3%. This is below our prior expectations and our long-term 3% to 5% goal. We now expect that diluted EPS for the full fiscal year will be between $1.29 and $1.32." Darden Restaurants, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates over 1,250 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones restaurants with annual sales of $4.4 billion.
