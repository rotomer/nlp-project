Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Mike Bernstein (407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE March 17, 2004 4:30 PM ET DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE OF 46 CENTS ORLANDO, FL, March 17 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. today reported quarterly sales of $1.24 billion for the third quarter ended February 22, 2004, and earnings per diluted share of 46 cents, a 31% increase versus last year. "This was a strong quarter for Darden Restaurants," said Joe Lee, Darden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We delivered record third quarter earnings per diluted share, driven by exceptional performance at Olive Garden and improved performance at Red Lobster. We are more committed than ever to improving the dining experiences we offer while maintaining a dedicated focus on profitability. Our excellent earnings this quarter reflect that commitment. I am pleased with our direction as we continue to build a casual dining company that will last for generations." Highlights for the quarter ended February 22, 2004, include the following: o Earnings after tax in the third quarter were $77.9 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.24 billion. Last year, earnings after tax were $61.8 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.18 billion. o Total sales of $1.24 billion represent a 5.1% increase over prior year. o Olive Garden reported its 38th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth with a 5.4% increase. o Red Lobster's same-restaurant sales declined 5.1% but its same-restaurant traffic declines moderated from the decline experienced in the second quarter. o Third quarter same-restaurant sales results at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster benefited by approximately 1% from favorable weather comparisons to last year.
-MORE- -2- o The Company reported a third quarter tax rate of 31.1%, compared to 33.8% last year. The decrease in the tax rate was a result of a favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. The earnings benefit derived from the lower tax rate was offset primarily by an increase in the amount of discretionary charitable contributions to the Darden Restaurants Foundation and the costs associated with Red Lobster's advertising agency change. o The Company continued its share repurchase program, buying back 4.1 million shares of its common stock in the third quarter. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S third quarter sales of $551.3 million were 9.1% above prior year, driven by a same-restaurant sales increase of 5.4% and revenue from 18 net new restaurants in operation versus last year. This is the 38th consecutive quarter of comparable-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden. The company's increased sales and traffic, combined with lower food and beverage expense, restaurant expenses, and selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of sales, resulted in a record operating profit that also represents a strong double-digit increase over last year. "It was another outstanding quarter for Olive Garden," said Drew Madsen, President of Olive Garden. "We delivered record financial performance in sales, operating profit and return on sales. Compelling promotional features, combined with our commitment to delight guests with a genuine Italian dining experience, resulted in this record-setting achievement. I want to thank our team at Olive Garden for their efforts to make all our guests feel like family when they visit our restaurants." RED LOBSTER'S third quarter sales of $603.6 million were 2.8% below prior year, resulting from a same-restaurant sales decrease of 5.1% that was partially offset by revenue from eight net new restaurants in operation versus last year. Despite lower sales and traffic versus last year, Red Lobster experienced decreased food and beverage costs, restaurant labor expenses, and selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of sales, which were partially offset by higher depreciation expenses as a percentage of sales. These factors led to a strong double-digit increase in operating profit versus last year. "This was a challenging quarter for Red Lobster," said Joe Lee. "While our performance during the quarter started off slowly, momentum continued to build throughout, culminating with the launch of this year's `LobsterFest' in February. And, despite sales that were down for the quarter versus prior year, operating profit increased dramatically primarily because of our focus on sustainable cost management to strengthen our business. We have more work ahead of us, but we know we are making progress on improving our operations, marketing and menu. I want to thank the crew for their dedication to making Red Lobster America's favorite place for seafood. " BAHAMA BREEZE has opened three restaurants year-to-date, bringing the total number of restaurants in operation to 37. One more opening is scheduled for this fiscal year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
-MORE- -3- SMOKEY BONES opened six new restaurants during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 20 net new openings. In addition, the company has opened five more restaurants since the end of the quarter. As a result, Smokey Bones now has 64 restaurants in operation. During this fiscal year, 30 restaurants are expected to open. Other Actions Darden continued the buyback of its common stock, purchasing 4.1 million shares in the third quarter.
