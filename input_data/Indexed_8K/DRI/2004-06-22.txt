Darden Restaurants, the world's largest casual dining company, said full year sales increased 7.5% to $5.0 billion. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 10.7% to $1.4 billion driven primarily by new restaurant growth at Olive Garden and Smokey Bones and the additional operating week in the quarter. "This was a good quarter for Darden Restaurants," said Joe Lee, Darden's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved solid fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share as a result of exceptional performance once again at Olive Garden and continued improvement at Red Lobster, Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones.

-3- Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S fourth quarter sales of $593.5 million were 15.7% above prior year, driven primarily by a same-restaurant sales increase of 5.0% (on a 13 weeks versus 13 weeks basis), revenue from 19 net new restaurants opened during fiscal 2004 and sales from the additional operating week. This is the 39th consecutive quarter of comparable-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden. Olive Garden had record total sales for the fiscal year of $2.2 billion, up 11.1% from last year, and its average annual sales per restaurant were $4.1 million (52 week base). For the quarter, the company's sales gains, combined with lower food and beverage costs, restaurant expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of sales, more than offset increased restaurant labor expenses. This resulted in a strong double-digit increase in operating profit for the quarter and the year along with record annual operating profit and return on sales. "This was a great quarter to complete an outstanding year for Olive Garden," said Drew Madsen, President of Olive Garden. "I am delighted that we could deliver such strong growth and record financial performance in sales, operating profit and return on sales. We have an exceptional team that is focused on delighting our guests with a genuine Italian dining experience. I want to thank that team for making our guests feel like family, whenever they choose to dine at Olive Garden. We are excited about our future and the opportunity to achieve even higher levels of success." RED LOBSTER'S fourth quarter sales of $652.8 million were 1.3% above prior year, driven by seven net new restaurants opened during fiscal 2004 and sales from the additional operating week partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in same-restaurant sales (on a 13 weeks versus 13 weeks basis). Red Lobster's total sales for the fiscal year were $2.4 billion, up 0.1% from last year, and its average annual sales per restaurant were $3.6 million (52 week base). Same-restaurant sales for the fiscal year were down 3.5%. Lower food and beverage costs, restaurant expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales more than offset higher restaurant labor expenses, which led to a strong double-digit increase in operating profit for the quarter versus last year. "We are encouraged that our team was able to grow profits in the fourth quarter, despite considerable challenges," said Kim Lopdrup, President of Red Lobster. "Importantly, we also increased our guest satisfaction scores significantly, and our sales trend since April has improved after we introduced our new transitional advertising campaign. Our 63,000 dedicated employees are committed to enhancing the dining experience of all our guests and building a simply great future for Red Lobster and all its stakeholders." BAHAMA BREEZE opened its new, reduced-investment prototype building in Pittsburgh, PA during the fourth quarter. Bahama Breeze also closed six restaurants during the quarter, reducing the total number in operation to 32 restaurants. Total sales for Bahama Breeze were $176.3 million in fiscal 2004 and average annual sales per restaurant (excluding the six closed restaurants) were $5.2 million (on a 52 week basis). SMOKEY BONES opened 10 restaurants during the fourth quarter and had 69 restaurants in operation at the end of the fiscal year. Since the end of the quarter, Smokey Bones has opened one restaurant located in Bowie, MD. Total sales for Smokey Bones were $174.3 million in fiscal 2004 and average annual sales per restaurant were $3.2 million (on a 52 week basis). The company plans to open 30 to 40 restaurants during fiscal 2005. -MORE-
-4- Other Actions Darden continued the buyback of its common stock, purchasing 4.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Since commencing its repurchase program in December 1995, the Company has repurchased a total of 109.2 million shares under authorizations totaling 115.4 million shares. The Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on September 29, 2004 at the Gaylord Palms Orlando Resort Hotel in Kissimmee, FL. The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is July 26, 2004. May 2004 Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden reported same-restaurant sales for the five-week May fiscal month ended May 30, 2004, which had an additional operating week versus last year. This period is the last month of Darden's fiscal 2004 fourth quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up 1% to 2% for fiscal May on a four weeks versus four weeks basis, which reflected a 2% to 3% increase in check average and a 1% to 2% decrease in guest counts. The check average increase was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1% increase from menu mix changes. Last year, same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were flat during fiscal May. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster were down 4% to 5% for fiscal May on a four weeks versus four weeks basis, which reflected a 0% to 1% decrease in check average and a 4% to 5% decrease in guest counts. The check average increase was a result of a 0% to 1% increase in pricing and a 1% decrease from menu mix changes. Last year, same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster were down 2% to 3% during fiscal May. Fiscal 2005 Outlook Darden expects combined same-restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2005 of between 1% and 3% for Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Darden also expects to open at least 50 to 60 new restaurants in fiscal 2005. "We have strong, consumer driven businesses and we will continue to do what is necessary to drive their growth. Given our near term focus to strengthen the performance at Red Lobster and Bahama Breeze, the continued roll-out of Smokey Bones as well as some uncertainty in economic conditions and the extra operating week in fiscal 2004, we believe diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of 8% to 12% is appropriate for fiscal 2005," said Lee. "Over the long term, we believe we can achieve annual diluted earnings per share growth in the double-digit range." Darden Restaurants, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates over 1,300 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons 52 restaurants with annual sales of $5.0 billion. -MORE-
