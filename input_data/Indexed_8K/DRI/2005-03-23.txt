Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Mike Bernstein (407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE March 23, 2005 4:15 PM ET DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 56 CENTS; INCREASES OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2005 DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH; DECLARES DIVIDEND ORLANDO, FL, March 23 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. today reported quarterly sales of $1.38 billion for the third quarter ended February 27, 2005, and diluted net earnings per share of 56 cents, a 24% increase over the prior year. "We had an outstanding quarter, with sales and earnings growth that were among the strongest in casual dining," said Clarence Otis, Chief Executive Officer of Darden. "These results reflect the tremendous efforts of the talented and committed teams in our restaurants and in our restaurant support center. People at Darden are passionate about nourishing and delighting everyone we serve, and about fully capturing the exciting opportunity we have in casual dining. We'll achieve these goals by combining brand excellence with competitively superior in-restaurant operations and restaurant support. This quarter, all of our business units made good progress in each of these critically important areas." Highlights for the quarter ended February 27, 2005, include the following: o Net earnings in the third quarter were $92.6 million or 56 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.38 billion. Last year, net earnings were $77.1 million, or 45 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.24 billion. o Total sales of $1.38 billion represent a 10.8% increase over prior year. o Olive Garden reported its 42nd consecutive quarter of U.S. same-restaurant sales growth with a 10.5% increase. o Red Lobster reported U.S. same-restaurant sales growth of 5.1% for the quarter. -MORE- -2- o The Company incurred costs related to the impairment of one Red Lobster and one Olive Garden restaurant which reduced diluted net earnings per share by approximately one cent. However, the Company's tax rate this quarter was slightly lower compared to last year as a result of the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and increased tax credits. This benefit added approximately one cent to diluted earnings per share in the quarter. o The Company expects diluted net earnings per share growth for fiscal 2005 in the range of 31% to 33% on a GAAP basis, which is an 19% to 21% increase excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charge ($23.1 million after tax or $0.14 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. o The Company announced that today the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 4 cents per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 8, 2005. o The Company continued its repurchase of shares, buying back almost 3.7 million shares of its common stock in the quarter. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S record third quarter sales of $627.8 million were 13.9% above prior year, driven by a same-restaurant sales increase of 10.5% and revenue from 22 net new restaurants in operation versus last year. This is the 42nd consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden and builds on a 5.4% increase in the third quarter last year. The company's increased sales, combined with lower selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses as a percent of sales resulted in double-digit operating profit growth, record operating profit and record returns for the third quarter. RED LOBSTER'S third quarter sales of $636.1 million were 5.4% above prior year, driven by a same-restaurant sales increase of 5.1%. Red Lobster's increased sales along with lower restaurant expense as a percent of sales and lower depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales, resulted in near-record operating profit for the third quarter. BAHAMA BREEZE delivered improved financial performance this quarter. Bahama Breeze achieved lower cost of sales, labor expense and restaurant expense as a percent of sales while strengthening the guest experience it provides. It also substantially reduced its operating loss compared to prior year despite having five fewer restaurants in operation. SMOKEY BONES opened 15 restaurants during the third quarter, bringing the total through the end of the third quarter to 29 openings. In addition, the company has opened four more restaurants since the end of the quarter. As a result, Smokey Bones now operates 102 restaurants. It expects to open 35 restaurants during the fiscal year.
-MORE- -3- "Darden delivered outstanding operating performance this quarter," said Drew Madsen, President and Chief Operating Officer for Darden. "Olive Garden led the way with tremendous sales and operating profit growth combined with strong guest satisfaction. Red Lobster continued to make excellent progress on key business fundamentals and achieved record guest satisfaction scores resulting in solid growth in sales and operating profit. Bahama Breeze's strengthening business model led to a substantial improvement in financial performance this quarter while Smokey Bones continued its rapid growth without compromising the high level of guest experience it offers." Outlook The Company expects diluted net earnings per share growth for fiscal 2005 to be in the range of 31 to 33% on a GAAP basis, which is an 19% to 21% increase excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charge ($23.1 million after tax or $0.14 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company had previously estimated that diluted net earnings per share growth would be in the range of 10% to 15% in fiscal 2005 excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Other Actions Darden announced that today the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 4 cents per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 8, 2005. Based on this 4-cent semi-annual dividend declaration, the Company's indicated annual dividend is 8 cents per share. The Company continued the buyback of its common stock, purchasing almost 3.7 million shares in the third quarter. Since December 1995, the Company has repurchased 116.1 million shares under authorizations totaling 137.4 million shares. February 2005 U.S. Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden reported U.S. same-restaurant sales for the four-week February fiscal month ended February 27, 2005. This period is the last month of Darden's fiscal 2005 third quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden increased almost 13% for fiscal February, which reflected an 11% to 12% increase in guest counts and approximately 2% increase in check average due primarily to pricing. Last year, Olive Garden had an increase of 4% to 5% in same-restaurant sales during fiscal February. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster increased approximately 9% to 10% for fiscal February, which reflected an increase of approximately 7% in guest counts and an increase of approximately 2% to 3% in check average from menu mix changes. Last year, Red Lobster reported a 0% to 1% increase in same-restaurant sales during fiscal February. The Company estimates that this year's shift of Valentine's Day from Saturday to Monday positively affected same-restaurant sales results at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points. Additionally, the Company estimates that adverse winter weather negatively affected same-restaurant sales results at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster by approximately one percentage point.
