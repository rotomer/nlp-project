Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On August 16, 2005, Darden Restaurants, Inc. ("we," "us" or the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of August 16, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. as syndication agent ("BOA"), SunTrust Bank as syndication agent ("SunTrust"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as documentation agent ("Wells Fargo"), Wachovia Bank, National Association as administrative agent ("Wachovia"), Comerica Bank ("Comerica"), Fifth Third Bank ("Fifth Third") and U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank") (collectively, the "Banks"), and related notes, forms of which are attached as exhibits to the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement supports our commercial paper program, and we also may use the proceeds from borrowings, if any, under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes. Advances under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of August 18, 2005, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement replaced our Prior Credit Agreement described below under Item 1.02. Under the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10 to this Form 8-K, we can borrow up to $500 million from the Banks from time to time before the termination date of August 15, 2010. As part of this credit facility, we may request the issuance of up to $100 million in letters of credit. The borrowings and letters of credit obtained under the Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies approved by the Banks. The Credit Agreement allows us to borrow at interest rates that vary based on a spread over (i) LIBOR or (ii) a base rate that is the higher of the prime rate or one-half of one percent above the federal funds rate, at our option. The interest rate spread over LIBOR is determined by our debt rating. We may also request that loans be made at interest rates offered by one or more of the Banks, which may vary from the LIBOR or base rate. We are required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount of loan commitments by the Banks, and the rate for such fee is determined by reference to our debt rating. The facility fee currently is 10.0 basis points per annum. The Credit Agreement contains covenants which are customary for similar credit arrangements, including covenants relating to financial reporting and notification, payment of indebtedness, taxes and other obligations, and compliance with applicable laws. There also are financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of less than 0.65 to 1.00, and that limit the amount of secured debt and debt owed by subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, to not more than 10% of our consolidated tangible net worth. The Credit Agreement does not, however, contain a prohibition on borrowing in the event of a "Material Adverse Effect", as defined in the Credit Agreement. Certain of the Banks and their affiliates have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial and other services to us, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which we have paid and intend to pay customary fees. Each of the Banks was a party to our Prior Credit Agreement described below under Item 1.02. To hedge our exposure on particular securities, we have from time to time entered into transactions involving derivative instruments, such as swaps, with BOA, Wells Fargo and SunTrust. Wachovia serves as the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock, the sponsor and administrator of our Direct Advantage Investment Program and our central bank for cash concentration and electronic payments. Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., an affiliate of Wachovia, is the lender under the ESOP loan agreement under which $26.0 million was outstanding as of May 29, 2005. SunTrust serves as custodian for the outstanding shares of treasury stock held by us and provides account processing services for several corporate banking accounts including accounts maintained to settle share repurchase transactions. Wells Fargo is the trustee under our indenture dated as of January 1, 1996 ("Indenture") pursuant to which we have debt securities outstanding, and has been appointed registrar and paying agent with respect to those outstanding debt securities. Banc of America Securities LLC, an affiliate of BOA; Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, an affiliate of Wachovia; SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., an affiliate of SunTrust; Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, an affiliate of Wells Fargo; Comerica Securities, Inc., an affiliate of Comerica; and Fifth Third Securities, Inc., an affiliate of Fifth Third, underwrote the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes issued under the Indenture on August 12, 2005, and have underwritten from time to time in the past, and may in the future underwrite, the issuance of debt securities under the Indenture. Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement. Upon execution of the Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01 above, effective August 16, 2005 we terminated our prior Credit Agreement dated as of October 17, 2003, as amended (the "Prior Credit Agreement"), by and 2
between us and the Banks, CitiBank, N.A. and Fleet National Bank (collectively, the "Prior Banks"). Under the Prior Credit Agreement, we could borrow from the Prior Banks up to $400 million from time to time before the termination date in October 2008. The Prior Credit Agreement allowed us to borrow at interest rates that varied based on a spread over (i) LIBOR or (ii) a base rate that is the higher of the prime rate or one-half of one percent above the federal funds rate, at our option. The interest rate spread over LIBOR was determined by our debt rating. The Prior Credit Agreement supported our commercial paper borrowing program. We were required to pay a facility fee of 12.5 basis points per annum on the average daily amount of loan commitments by the Prior Banks. The amount of interest and the annual facility fee were subject to change based on our maintenance of certain debt ratings and financial ratios, such as maximum debt to capital ratios. The Prior Credit Agreement contained covenants that were customary for similar credit arrangements, and also contained financial covenants that required us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of less than 0.55 to 1.00, and a limitation of $25 million on the amount of priority debt, subject to certain exceptions. Advances under the Prior Credit Agreement were unsecured. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement. A brief description of any material relationships between us and the Banks, other than in respect of the Prior Credit Agreement, is provided under Item 1.01 above. Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. As described above under Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K, on August 16, 2005, we entered into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of August 18, 2005, no amounts have been borrowed under this facility. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits.

The Dollar Equivalent of each Eurocurrency Borrowing under this Section 2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 and each Base Rate Borrowing under this Section 2.01 shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $500,000 (except that any such Syndicated Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount of the Total Unused Commitments) and each Syndicated Borrowing shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, repay or, to the 18
extent permitted by Section 2.11, prepay Syndicated Loans and reborrow under this Section 2.01 at any time before the Termination Date. SECTION 2.02 Method of Borrowing Syndicated Loans. (a) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L (a "Notice of Borrowing") which notice shall be delivered prior to 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) (1) on the Business Day of each Base Rate Borrowing, (2) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, and (3) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case of Special Notice Currencies) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and shall specify the following: (i) the date of such Syndicated Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day in the case of either a Base Rate Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) the aggregate amount of such Syndicated Borrowing, (iii) whether the Syndicated Loans comprising such Syndicated Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, (iv) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period, and (v) the Applicable Currency of such Syndicated Borrowing. (b) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (c) In the case of a Borrowing of Syndicated Loans, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (d) of this Section) make available its ratable share of such Borrowing, in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent's Office or the Applicable Currency not later than 1:00 p.m. in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Loan denominated in Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day if for a Eurocurrency Loan or the Business Day if for a Base Rate Loan, as specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address. Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Bank, at the Administrative Agent's Office, no later than 4:00 p.m. (local time at such address) on the Business Day before the date of a Syndicated Borrowing stating that such Banks will not make a Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that such Banks will make a Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing and, in reliance on such assumption, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make available such Bank's ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing to the Borrower for the account of such Bank. If the Administrative Agent makes such Bank's ratable share available to the Borrower 19
and such Bank does not in fact make its ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing available on such date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such Bank's ratable share from such Bank or the Borrower (and for such purpose shall be entitled to charge such amount to any account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent), together with interest thereon for each day during the period from the date of such Syndicated Borrowing until such sum shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to (x) the Overnight Rate from the date such payment is due until the third Business Day following such date, and (y) the Base Rate thereafter, provided that (i) any such payment by the Borrower of such Bank's ratable share and interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any rights that the Borrower may have against such Bank and (ii) until such Bank has paid its ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing, together with all interest pursuant to the foregoing, it will have no interest in or rights with respect to such Syndicated Borrowing for any purpose hereunder. If the Administrative Agent does not exercise its option to advance funds for the account of such Bank, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of such decision. (d) If any Bank makes a new Syndicated Loan hereunder on a day on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Syndicated Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Syndicated Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection (c) of this Section 2.02, or remitted by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.13, as the case may be. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Eurocurrency Borrowing may be made if there shall have occurred a Default, which Default shall not have been cured or waived in writing. (f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify whether the Syndicated Loans comprising such Syndicated Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans, such Syndicated Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower is otherwise entitled under this Agreement to repay any Syndicated Loans maturing at the end of an Interest Period applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new Syndicated Borrowing, and the Borrower fails to repay such Syndicated Loans using its own moneys and fails to give a Notice of Borrowing in connection with such new Syndicated Borrowing, a new Syndicated Borrowing shall be deemed to be made on the date such Syndicated Loans mature in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Syndicated Loans so maturing, and the Syndicated Loans comprising such new Syndicated Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans. (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) there shall not be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods outstanding at the same time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different numbered clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous) and (ii) the proceeds of any Base Rate Borrowing shall be applied first to repay the unpaid principal amount of all Base Rate Loans (if any) outstanding immediately before such Base Rate Borrowing. 20
SECTION 2.03 Money Market Loans. (a) In addition to making Syndicated Borrowings, the Borrower may, as set forth in this Section 2.03, request the Banks to make offers to make Money Market Borrowings in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies available to the Borrower. The Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section 2.03, provided that: (i) the number of interest rates applicable to Money Market Loans which may be outstanding at any given time is subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(g); (ii) the Total Outstandings after giving effect to such requested Money Market Borrowing shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks at such time; (iii) the Outstanding Amount of all Syndicated Loans, Money Market Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit; (iv) the Outstanding Amount of all Money Market Loans, together with the Outstanding Amount of all Syndicated Loans and all Letter of Credit Obligations, at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all of the Banks at such time; and (v) the Money Market Loans of any Banks will be deemed to be usage of the Commitments for the purpose of calculating availability pursuant to Section 2.01 and this 2.03(a), but will not reduce such Bank's obligation to lend its pro rata share of the remaining Total Unused Commitments. (b) When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Money Market Loans, it shall give the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks) notice substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto (a "Money Market Quote Request") so as to be received no later than 12:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) at least (x) two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the Money Market Borrowing proposed therein (if such proposed Borrowing is of Money Market Loans denominated in Dollars) or (y) four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of Special Notice Currencies) prior to the date of the Money Market Borrowing proposed therein (if such proposed Borrowing is of Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency) (or, in the case of either (x) or (y), such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Required Banks, may agree), specifying: (i) the proposed Applicable Currency of such Money Market Borrowing; (ii) the proposed date of such Money Market Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day (the "Money Market Borrowing Date"); (iii) the maturity date (or dates) (each a "Stated Maturity Date") for repayment of each Money Market Loan to be made as part of such Money Market Borrowing (which Stated Maturity Date shall be that date occurring not less than seven (7) days but not more than 180 days from the date of such Money Market Borrowing); provided that the 21
Stated Maturity Date for any Money Market Loan may not extend beyond the Termination Date (as in effect on the date of such Money Market Quote Request); and (iv) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of principal to be requested by the Borrower as a result of such Money Market Borrowing, which shall be at least $5,000,000 (and in larger integral multiples of $1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section 2.03(a) to be violated. The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans having up to three (3) different Stated Maturity Dates in a single Money Market Quote Request; provided that the request for each separate Stated Maturity Date shall be deemed to be a separate Money Market Quote Request for a separate Money Market Borrowing. Except as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower shall not deliver a Money Market Quote Request more frequently than once every five (5) Business Days. (c) (i) Each Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, submit a response containing an offer to make a Money Market Loan substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto (a "Money Market Quote") in response to any Money Market Quote Request; provided that, if the Borrower's request under Section 2.03(b) specified more than one (1) Stated Maturity Date, such Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, make a single submission containing a separate offer for each such Stated Maturity Date and each such separate offer shall be deemed to be a separate Money Market Quote. Each Money Market Quote must be submitted to the Administrative Agent not later than (x) 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in Dollars or (y) 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency; provided that any Money Market Quote submitted by Wachovia may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if Wachovia notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer contained therein not later than 9:45 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date or the day prior to the Money Market Borrowing Date, as applicable, (or fifteen (15) minutes prior to the time that the other Banks are required to have submitted their respective Money Market Quotes). Subject to Section 3.02, any Money Market Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower. (ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto and shall specify: (A) the proposed Money Market Borrowing Date and the Stated Maturity Date therefor; (B) the principal amounts of the Money Market Loan which the quoting Bank is willing to make for the applicable Money Market Quote, which Dollar Equivalent principal amounts (x) may be greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (y) shall be at least $5,000,000 or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (z) may not exceed the principal amount of the Money Market Borrowing for which offers were requested; 22
(C) the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) offered for each such Money Market Loan (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Money Market Rate"); and (D) the identity of the quoting Bank. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, no Money Market Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Money Market Quote Request (other than setting forth the principal amounts of the Money Market Loan which the quoting Bank is willing to make for the applicable Interest Period) and, in particular, no Money Market Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which such Money Market Quote is being made. (d) The Administrative Agent shall as promptly as practicable after the Money Market Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than (x) 10:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in Dollars or (y) 10:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency), notify the Borrower of the terms (i) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.03(c) and (ii) of any Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the principal amounts of the Money Market Borrowing for which offers have been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and Money Market Rates so offered by each Bank (identifying the Bank that made each Money Market Quote). (e) Not later than (x) 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in Dollars or (y) 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.03(d) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank which submitted an offer. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers (for each Stated Maturity Date) that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that: (i) the Outstanding Amount of each Money Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market Quote Request; (ii) the Outstanding Amount of each Money Market Borrowing comprising a Money Market Borrowing shall be at least $5,000,000 (and in larger integral multiples of $1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section 2.03(a) to be violated; 23
(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made in ascending order of Money Market Rates; and (iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer where the Administrative Agent has advised the Borrower that such offer fails to comply with Section 2.03(c)(ii) or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.03(a)). If offers are made by two (2) or more Banks with the same Money Market Rates for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Stated Maturity Date, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among such Banks as nearly as possible in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Determinations by the Borrower of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has been accepted shall, not later than (x) 12:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in Dollars or (y) 9:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Money Market Borrowing Date for Money Market Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, make the amount of such Money Market Loan allocated to it available to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01 in Same Day Funds in the Applicable Currency. The amount so received by the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available to the Borrower on such date by depositing the same, in Same Day Funds, not later than 4:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), in an account of such Borrower maintained with Wachovia. (g) After any Money Market Loan has been funded, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Banks of the aggregate principal amount of the Money Market Quotes received and the highest and lowest rates included in such Money Market Quotes. (h) Any Bank may fund a Money Market Loan directly or through a conduit entity maintained by such Bank. (i) At any time prior to the Borrower's acceptance of any offer pursuant to Section 2.03(e), the Borrower may cancel a Money Market Quote Request. SECTION 2.04 Continuation and Conversion Elections. By delivering a notice (a "Notice of Continuation or Conversion"), which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit M, to the Administrative Agent on or before 12:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) prior to (1) the Business Day of each conversion to a Base Rate Loan, (2) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any conversion to or continuation of, Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, and (3) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case of Special Notice Currencies) prior to the requested date of any conversion to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably elect, by notice delivered that all, or any portion in an aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent amount of $5,000,000 or any larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 be, (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, converted into Eurocurrency Loans or (ii) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, converted into 24
Base Rate Loans or continued as Eurocurrency Loans; provided, however, that (x) each such conversion or continuation shall be pro rated among the applicable outstanding Loans of all Banks that have made such Loans, (y) no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Loans may be continued as, or be converted into, any Eurocurrency Loan when any Default has occurred and is continuing, and (z) when any Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Banks may demand that any or all of the then-outstanding Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be converted to Dollar-denominated Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then-current Interest Period with respect thereto. In the absence of delivery of a Notice of Continuation or Conversion with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan at least three (3) Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, such Eurocurrency Loan shall, on such last day, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan; provided, however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of a Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loan shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Loan in its original currency with an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. SECTION 2.05 Notes. (a) Upon the request of any Bank, made through the Administrative Agent, the Syndicated Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by a single Syndicated Loan Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the original principal amount of such Bank's Commitment. (b) Upon request of any Bank, made through the Administrative Agent, the Money Market Loans made by any Bank to the Borrower may be evidenced by a single Money Market Loan Note payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the original principal amount of the Total Commitments. (c) Upon receipt of each Bank's Notes pursuant to Section 3.01(a) and (b) the Administrative Agent shall deliver such Notes to such Bank. Each Bank shall record, and prior to any transfer of its Notes shall endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to evidence, the date, amount and maturity of, and effective interest rate for, each Loan made by it, the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto and whether, in the case of such Bank's Syndicated Loan Note, such Syndicated Loan is a Base Rate Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan, and such schedule of each such Bank's Note shall constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such Bank's Note; provided that the failure of any Bank to make, or any error in making, any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the ability of any Bank to assign its Note. Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of any Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required. SECTION 2.06 Maturity of Loans. Each Money Market Loan shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the Stated Maturity Date applicable to such Loan. All Loans shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the Termination Date. 25
SECTION 2.07 Interest Rates. (a) "Applicable Margin" shall be the rate per annum set forth below opposite the applicable Pricing Level: ....................... ....................... ................................. Pricing Level Base Rate Loans Eurocurrency Loans and Letters of Credit ....................... ....................... ................................. Level I 0% 0.260% ....................... ....................... ................................. Level II 0% 0.350% ....................... ....................... ................................. Level III 0% 0.375% ....................... ....................... ................................. Level IV 0% 0.600% ....................... ....................... ................................. Adjustments, if any, in the Applicable Margin shall be made by the Administrative Agent and shall be effective for Interest Periods applicable to Eurocurrency Loans commencing on or after the date of any adjustments to the Pricing Level as provided in the definition thereof. (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be payable on each Quarterly Payment Date while such Base Rate Loan is outstanding and on the date such Base Rate Loan is converted to a Eurocurrency Loan or repaid with the proceeds of any Money Market Loan. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. (c) Each Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, at intervals of three (3) months after the first day thereof. The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100th of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00 minus the Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage. The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Eurocurrency Loan means, for the Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Loan, the rate per annum determined on the basis of the offered rate for deposits in the Applicable Currency of amounts equal or comparable to the principal amount of such Eurocurrency Loan offered for a term comparable to such Interest Period, which rates appear on Telerate Page 3750 effective as of 11:00 a.m.., London time, two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period, provided that if no such offered rates appear on such page, the "London Interbank Offered Rate" for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100th of 1%) of rates quoted by not less than two (2) major lenders in New York City, selected by the Administrative 26
Agent, at approximately 10:00 A.M., New York City time, two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period, for deposits in Dollars the Applicable Currency offered by leading European banks for a period comparable to such Interest Period in an amount comparable to the principal amount of such Eurocurrency Loan. "Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage. (d) Each Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted IBOR Rate for such Interest Period. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, at intervals of three (3) months after the first day thereof. "Adjusted IBOR Rate" means, with respect to each Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the sum of (i) the rate obtained by dividing (A) IBOR for such Interest Period by (B) a percentage equal to 1 minus the then stated maximum rate (stated as a decimal) of all reserve requirements in respect of any category of liabilities by reference to which the interest rate on such Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency is determined (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserves) applicable to any member bank of the Federal Reserve System as defined in Regulation D (or against any successor category of liabilities as defined in Regulation D), plus (ii) if the relevant Foreign Currency Loan is in British pounds sterling, a percentage sufficient to compensate the Banks for the cost of complying with any reserves, liquidity and/or special deposit requirements of the Bank of England directly or indirectly affecting the maintenance or funding of such Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency. "IBOR" means, for any Interest Period, with respect to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the offered rate for deposits in the applicable Alternative Currency, for a period comparable to the Interest Period and in an amount comparable to the amount of such Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency appearing on the applicable Telerate Page as of 11:00 a.m. (London, England time) on the day that is two Business Days prior to the first day of the Interest Period. If the foregoing rate is unavailable from Telerate for any reason, then such rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent from any other interest rate reporting service of recognized standing designated in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower. (e) Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on any Eurocurrency Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. 27
(f) Each Money Market Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Money Market Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Money Market Rate set forth in the relevant Money Market Quote. Such interest shall be payable on the Stated Maturity Date thereof, and, if the Stated Maturity Date occurs more than 90 days after the date of the relevant Money Market Loan, at intervals of 90 days after the first day thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. (g) The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder in accordance with this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks by facsimile of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. (h) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, the principal amount of the Loans (and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, all accrued interest thereon) may, at the election of the Required Banks, bear interest at the Default Rate. SECTION 2.08 Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Bank a facility fee equal to the product of: (i) the aggregate of the daily average amounts of such Bank's Commitment, times (ii) a per annum percentage equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate. Such facility fee shall accrue from and including the Closing Date to and including the Termination Date. Facility fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Termination Date; provided that should the Commitments be terminated at any time prior to the Termination Date for any reason, the entire accrued and unpaid facility fee shall be paid on the date of such termination. The "Applicable Facility Fee Rate" shall be the rate per annum set forth below opposite the applicable Pricing Level: ......................... .......................... Pricing Level Applicable Facility Fee Rate ......................... .......................... Level I .090% ......................... .......................... Level II .100% ......................... .......................... Level III .125% ......................... .......................... Level IV .150% ......................... .......................... Adjustments, if any, in the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent and shall be effective on the date of any adjustments to the Pricing Level as provided in the definition thereof. (b) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Bank a utilization fee equal to the product of: (i) the aggregate of the daily average amounts of such Bank's Commitment, multiplied by (ii) a per annum percentage equal to the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate. The Applicable Utilization Fee Rate may vary daily in accordance with the percentage of the Total Commitments that is currently outstanding as Loans and Letter of Credit 28
Obligations. Such utilization fee shall accrue from and including the Closing Date to and including the Termination Date. Utilization fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Termination Date; provided that should the Commitments be terminated at any time prior to the Termination Date for any reason, the entire accrued and unpaid utilization fee shall be paid on the date of such termination. The "Applicable Utilization Fee Rate" shall be the rate per annum set forth below opposite the applicable Pricing Level: ................................................................................. Applicable Utilization Fee Rate ................................................................................. .................... ............................................................ Percentage of Total Commitments currently outstanding as Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations: .................... ............................................................ Pricing Level Less than 50% Greater than or equal to 50% .................... ........................... ................................ Level I 0% 0.100% .................... ........................... ................................ Level II 0% 0.100% .................... ........................... ................................ Level III 0% 0.125% .................... ........................... ................................ Level IV 0% 0.125% .................... ........................... ................................ Adjustments, if any, in the Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent and shall be effective on the date of any adjustments to the Pricing Level as provided in the definition thereof. (c) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account and sole benefit of the Administrative Agent, such fees and other amounts at such times as set forth in the Administrative Agent's Letter Agreement. SECTION 2.09 Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The Borrower may, upon at least three (3) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate at any time, or proportionately reduce from time to time the Total Unused Commitments by an aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000. If the Commitments are terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under Section 2.08) shall be due and payable on the effective date of such termination. All terminations or reductions of Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction shall be made ratably among the Banks in accordance with their respective Commitments. SECTION 2.10 Termination of Commitments. The Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date. SECTION 2.11 Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may, upon at least one (1) Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating at least $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (or any lesser amount equal to the outstanding balance of such Loan), by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment. Each such optional 29
prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Base Rate Loans of the several Banks included in such Base Rate Borrowing. (b) Except as provided in Section 8.02 and subject to any payments required pursuant to the terms of Article VIII for such Eurocurrency Loan, upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and upon four (4) Business Days (or (5) five Business Days in the case of Special Notice Currencies), the Borrower may prepay in minimum Dollar Equivalent amounts of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 (or any lesser amount equal to the outstanding balance of such Loan) all or any portion of the principal amount of any Eurocurrency Loan or Money Market Loan prior to the maturity thereof. (c) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.11, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prepayments shall not affect Borrower's obligations under any Hedging Agreements, which shall remain in full force and effect, subject to the terms of such Hedging Agreement. SECTION 2.12 Mandatory Prepayments. On each date on which the conditions set forth in Section 2.01 are not satisfied (including, without limitation, because (i) the Commitments are reduced or terminated pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section 2.10, (ii) if for any reason (including exchange rate fluctuations) the Outstanding Amount of all Syndicated Loans, Money Market Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds the Alternative Currency Sublimit or (iii) if for any reason (including exchange rate fluctuations) the Total Obligations exceed the amount of the Commitments), the Borrower shall repay or prepay such principal amount of the outstanding Loans, if any (together with interest accrued thereon and any amounts due under Section 8.05(a)), as may be necessary so that after such payment the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as then reduced. Each such payment or prepayment shall be applied to repay or prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks; provided that such prepayment shall be applied, first, to Base Rate Loans outstanding on the date of such prepayment (in direct order of maturity), second, to the extent necessary, to Eurocurrency Loans outstanding on the date of such prepayment (in direct order of maturity) and then, to the extent necessary, to Money Market Loans outstanding on the date of such prepayment (in direct order of maturity). SECTION 2.13 General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and of fees hereunder (except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans or Reimbursement Obligations denominated in an Alternative Currency), without any setoff, counterclaim or any deduction whatsoever, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks and the Issuing Bank, at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due, in Dollars and Same Day Funds immediately available in Charlotte, 30
North Carolina. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal of and interest on Loans and Reimbursement Obligations denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Banks or Issuing Bank to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to the Issuing Bank such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the Issuing Bank. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 11:00 a.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans, the Money Market Loans or of fees shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Eurocurrency Loans shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time. (c) All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other amounts to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or fee relating thereto shall be paid without deduction for, and free from, any tax, imposts, levies, duties, deductions, or withholdings of any nature now or at anytime hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or by any taxing authority thereof or therein excluding in the case of each Bank and the Issuing Bank, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Issuing Bank is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank and the Issuing Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's or the Issuing Bank's applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, imposts, levies, duties, deductions or withholdings of any nature being "Taxes"). In the event that the Borrower is required by Applicable Law to make any such withholding or deduction of Taxes with respect to any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation, fee or other amount, or any such Loan, Reimbursement Obligation, fee or other amount is subject to Taxes payable by any Bank or the Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall pay such amount, deduction or withholding to the applicable taxing authority, shall promptly furnish to any Bank or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction or withholding is made all receipts and other documents evidencing such payment and shall pay to such Bank or the Issuing Bank additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the amount received by such Bank or the Issuing Bank after the required withholding or other payment shall equal the amount such Bank or Issuing Bank would have received had no such withholding or other payment been made. If no payment, withholding or deduction of Taxes is payable in respect of any Loan or fee relating thereto, the Borrower shall furnish any Bank or Issuing Bank, at such Bank's or the Issuing Bank's request, a certificate from each applicable taxing authority or an opinion of 31
counsel acceptable to such Bank or Issuing Bank, in either case stating that such payments are exempt from or not subject to payment, withholding or deduction of Taxes. If the Borrower fails to provide such original or certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment of Taxes or certificate(s) or opinion of counsel of exemption, the Borrower hereby agrees to compensate such Bank and the Issuing Bank for, and indemnify them with respect to, the tax consequences of the Borrower's failure to provide evidence of tax payments or tax exemption. (d) Any Bank or Issuing Bank that is not organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof (a "Foreign Bank") that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in U.S. Federal withholding tax shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or, in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming exemption from in U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest," (i) a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto and (ii) a certificate representing that such Foreign Bank is not (A) a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, (B) is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and (C) is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Bank claiming, as applicable, complete exemption from or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming exemption for "portfolio interest" certifying that it is not a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Bank on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Bank changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a "New Lending Office"). In addition, each Foreign Bank shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Bank. (e) Upon the request of the Borrower, any Bank or Issuing Bank that is not a Foreign Bank shall deliver to the Borrower two copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed. If any Bank or Issuing Bank fails to deliver Form W-9 or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto as required herein, then the Borrower may withhold from any payment to such party an amount equivalent to the applicable backup withholding Tax imposed by the Code, without reduction. (f) The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Bank or Issuing Bank or to pay any additional amounts to any Bank or Issuing Bank in respect of U.S. Federal withholding tax pursuant to Section 2.13(d) or Section 2.13(e) to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Bank or Issuing Bank to comply with the provisions of such Sections. Should a Bank or Issuing Bank become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall, at such Bank's or Issuing Bank's expense, take such steps as such Bank or Issuing Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank or Issuing Bank to recover such Taxes. 32
(g) Each of the Banks and the Issuing Bank agrees that upon the occurrence of any circumstances entitling such Bank or Issuing Bank to indemnification or additional amounts pursuant to this Section, such Bank or Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts to take any action (including designating a new lending office and signing any prescribed forms or other documentation appropriate in the circumstances) if such action would reduce or eliminate any Tax (including penalties or interest, as applicable) with respect to which such indemnification or additional amounts may thereafter accrue; provided that a Bank or Issuing Bank shall not be required to take any such action if it shall determine in its sole discretion that doing so would be materially disadvantageous to its interests. (h) In the event any Bank or Issuing Bank receives a refund of any Taxes paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.13, it will pay to the Borrower the amount of such refund promptly upon receipt thereof; provided, however, if at any time thereafter it is required to return such refund, the Borrower shall promptly repay to it the amount of such refund. (i) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.13 shall be applicable with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions (i) shall be made based upon the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and (ii) constitute a continuing agreement and shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full or cancellation of the Notes. (j) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks or Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank or Issuing Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank or Issuing Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date, each Bank and Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank or Issuing Bank, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank or Issuing Bank until the date such Bank or Issuing Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate for the first three (3) Business Days after the date such payment is due and at the Base Rate thereafter. SECTION 2.14 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day); provided that in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, interest shall be computed in accordance with such market practice. Interest on Base Rate Loans based on the Overnight Rate and interest on Eurocurrency Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, calculated as to each Interest Period from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof. Facility fees and any other fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day); provided that in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which 33
market practice differs from the foregoing, interest shall be computed in accordance with such market practice. SECTION 2.15 Existing Credit Agreement and Existing Notes. The Borrower and the Administrative Agent acknowledge and agree that there are no obligations of the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement as of the Closing Date which have not been paid and satisfied. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby terminated by agreement of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Banks party hereto which are also parties to the Existing Credit Agreement. The Borrower will obtain similar agreements as to termination from all other parties to the Existing Credit Agreement. All promissory notes issued by the Borrower under the Existing Credit Agreement shall be either (i) returned to the Borrower, marked "Paid in Full and Discharged," or (ii) destroyed by each Bank hereinafter referred to in this sentence with a written notice from such Bank to the Borrower that such promissory notes have been destroyed, in either case on or within ten (10) Business Days of the Closing Date by the Banks under this Agreement which were also banks under the Existing Credit Agreement, and the Borrower will request similar delivery of promissory notes or similar notices of destruction from all other banks under the Existing Credit Agreement, if any, within the same time period. SECTION 2.16 Letter of Credit Facility. (a) Obligation to Issue. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower herein set forth, the Issuing Bank shall issue for the account of Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies, in accordance with this Section 2.16, from time to time during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the Business Day prior to the Termination Date. (b) Types and Amounts. The Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit at any time: (i) if the aggregate maximum amount then available for drawing under Letters of Credit, after giving effect to the issuance of the requested Letter of Credit, shall exceed any limit imposed by law or regulation upon the Issuing Bank; (ii) if, after giving effect to the issuance of the requested Letter of Credit, (A) the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations would exceed $100,000,000, or (B) the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.01 would not be satisfied; (iii) which has an expiration date on or after the earlier of (A) the date twelve (12) months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve (12) months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit so long as such renewal or extension occurs within three (3) months of such then-current expiration date) and (B) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date; provided that a Letter of Credit having an expiry date later than five (5) Business Days prior to the maturity date (an "Extended Letter of Credit") may be issued if (1) such Extended Letter of Credit (A) has an expiration date no later than one year after the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (B) does not provide for 34
the renewal thereof for additional periods, and (2) Cash Collateral or Backup Letters of Credit satisfactory to Issuing Bank in its sole discretion are provided in respect of such Extended Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.16(j). (c) Conditions. In addition to being subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article III, the obligation of the Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit is subject to the satisfaction in full of the following conditions: (i) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Issuing Bank at such times and in such manner as the Issuing Bank may prescribe, a Letter of Credit Application Agreement and such other documents and materials as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof all satisfactory in form and substance to the Issuing Bank and the terms of the proposed Letter of Credit shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Issuing Bank; (ii) as of the date of issuance no order, judgment or decree of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing the Letter of Credit and no law, rule or regulation applicable to the Issuing Bank and no request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or the issuance of that Letter of Credit; and (iii) after the issuance of the requested Letter of Credit, the conditions set forth in the first sentence of Section 2.01 shall be satisfied. (d) Issuance of Letters of Credit. (i) Request for Issuance. At least two Business Days before the effective date for any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall give the Issuing Bank a written notice containing the original signature of an authorized officer or employee of such Borrower. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the original face amount of the Letter of Credit requested (which original face amount shall not be less than $100,000, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Bank), the Applicable Currency of the Letter of Credit requested, the effective date (which day shall be a Business Day) of issuance of such requested Letter of Credit, the date on which such requested Letter of Credit is to expire, the amount of then outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations, the purpose for which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, whether such Letter of Credit may be drawn in single or partial draws and the person for whose benefit the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued. (ii) Issuance; Notice of Issuance. If the conditions set forth in Section 2.16(c) are satisfied, the Issuing Bank shall issue the requested Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall give each Bank written or telex notice, or telephonic notice substantially in the form of Exhibit N, or telephonic notice confirmed promptly thereafter in writing, of the issuance of a Letter of Credit and shall deliver to each Bank in connection with such notice a copy of the Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank. 35
(iii) No Extension or Amendment. The Issuing Bank shall not extend or amend any Letter of Credit if the issuance of a new Letter of Credit having the same terms as such Letter of Credit as so amended or extended would be prohibited by Section 2.16(b) or (c). (e) Reimbursement Obligations; Duties of the Issuing Bank. (i) Reimbursement. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in any Letter of Credit Application Agreement: (A) the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank for drawings under a Letter of Credit issued by it no later than the Business Day of payment by the Issuing Bank; (B) any Reimbursement Obligation with respect to any Letter of Credit shall bear interest from the date of the relevant drawing under the pertinent Letter of Credit until the date of payment in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate; and (C) in order to implement the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a draw under any Letter of Credit, unless the Issuing Bank is reimbursed in accordance with clause (i) above, the Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent to treat such nonpayment as a Notice of Borrowing in the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation and the Banks to make Syndicated Loans to Borrower in such amount regardless of whether the conditions precedent to the making of Syndicated Loans hereunder have been met. The Borrower further authorizes the Administrative Agent to credit the proceeds of such Syndicated Loan so as to immediately eliminate the liability of the Borrower for Reimbursement Obligations under such Letter of Credit. (ii) Duties of the Issuing Bank. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence, shall not put the Issuing Bank under any resulting liability to any Bank, or assuming that the Issuing Bank has complied with the procedures specified in Section 2.16(d) and such Bank has not given a notice contemplated by Section 2.16(f)(i) that continues in full force and effect, relieve that Bank of its obligations hereunder to the Issuing Bank. In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall have no obligation relative to the Banks other than to confirm that any documents required to have been delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to comply on their face, with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. (iii) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each Letter of Credit. 36
(f) Participations. (i) Purchase of Participations. Immediately upon issuance by the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16(d), each Bank shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from the Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Bank's ratable share of the aggregate Commitments, in such Letter of Credit. (ii) Sharing of Letter of Credit Payments. In the event that the Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of Credit for which the applicable Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.16(g) or which cannot be paid by a Loan pursuant to Section 2.16(e) the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify each Bank of such failure, and each Bank shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Issuing Bank such Bank's ratable share of the amount of such payment in Same Day Funds in the Applicable Currency of the relevant Letter of Credit. If the Issuing Bank so notifies such Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on any Business Day, such Bank shall make available to the Issuing Bank its ratable share of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in Same Day Funds. If such Bank notifies the Administrative Agent that it cannot make its ratable share of the amount of such payment in the Alternative Currency of the relevant Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall inform the Bank and the Issuing Bank of the Spot Rate and the Bank may make a payment on the required Business Day to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in an amount sufficient, in the sole opinion of the Issuing Bank, for the Issuing Bank to purchase with Dollars such amount in the Alternative Currency based on the current Spot Rate. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so made its ratable share of the amount of such payment available to the Issuing Bank, such Bank agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon (or the Dollar Equivalent of such amount with interest thereon, if the Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency), for each day from the date such payment was first due until the date such amount is paid to the Issuing Bank at the Overnight Rate for the first 3 days and thereafter at the Base Rate. The failure of any Bank to make available to the Issuing Bank its ratable share of any such payment shall neither relieve nor increase the obligation of any other Bank hereunder to make available to the Issuing Bank its ratable share of any payment on the date such payment is to be made. (iii) Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments. Whenever the Issuing Bank receives a payment on account of a Reimbursement Obligation, including any interest thereon, as to which the Issuing Bank has received any payments from the Banks pursuant to this Section 2.16(f), it shall promptly pay to each Bank which has funded its participating interest therein, in Dollars and in the kind of funds so received, an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share thereof. Each such payment shall be made by the Issuing Bank on the Business Day on which the funds are paid to such Person, if received prior to 10:00 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on such Business Day, and otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day. (iv) Documentation. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank shall furnish to the Administrative Agent copies of any Letter of Credit, 37
Letter of Credit Application Agreement and other documentation relating to Letters of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement. (v) Obligations Irrevocable. The obligations of the Banks to make payments to the Issuing Bank with respect to a Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable, not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with, but not subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances (assuming that the Issuing Bank has issued such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.16(d)), including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (B) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions; (C) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (D) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of any draft or certificate proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, except payment resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (F) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of any draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, except payment resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; or (G) any other circumstances or happenings whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, except circumstances or happenings resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. (g) Payment of Reimbursement Obligations. (i) Payments to Issuing Bank. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank the amount of all Reimbursement Obligations, interest and other amounts payable to the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower's account immediately when due, irrespective of: 38
(A) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (B) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions; (C) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (D) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (E) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of any draft or certificate proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, except payment resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (F) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of any draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, except payment resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; or (G) any other circumstances or happenings whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, except circumstances or happenings resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. (ii) Recovery or Avoidance of Payments. In the event any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower received by the Issuing Bank with respect to a Letter of Credit and distributed by the Issuing Bank to the Banks on account of their participations is thereafter set aside, avoided or recovered from the Issuing Bank in connection with any receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, each Bank that received such distribution shall, upon demand by the Issuing Bank, contribute such Bank's ratable share of the amount set aside, avoided or recovered together with interest at the rate required to be paid by the Issuing Bank upon the amount required to be repaid by it. (h) Compensation for Letters of Credit. (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent with respect to each Letter of Credit issued hereunder (i) for the account of each Bank, a participation fee (a "Participation Fee") with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin applicable to interest on Eurocurrency Loans in the Applicable Currency on the average daily amount of such Bank's Letter of Credit Obligations during the period from and including 39
the date hereof to but excluding the later of the date on which such Bank's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Bank ceases to have any Letter of Credit Obligations, and (ii) for the account of the Issuing Bank, a fronting fee ("Fronting Fee" and, together with Participation Fees, "Letter of Credit Fees") equal to 0.10% per annum of the face amount of such Letter of Credit. Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Termination Date. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit such Participation Fees, when paid, to the Banks in accordance with their ratable shares thereof. (ii) Issuing Bank Charges. The Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Bank, solely for its own account, the standard charges assessed by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, administration, amendment and payment or cancellation of Letters of Credit issued hereunder, which charges shall be those typically charged by the Issuing Bank to its customers generally having credit and other characteristics similar to the Borrower, as determined in good faith by the Issuing Bank. (i) Indemnification; Exoneration. (i) Indemnification. In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere provided in this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall protect, indemnify, pay and save the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and each Bank harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) which the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, or any Bank may incur or be subject to as a consequence of the issuance of any Letter of Credit for the Borrower's account other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. (ii) Assumption of Risk by Borrower. As between the Borrower, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued for such Borrower's account by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall not be responsible for (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of the Letters of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged, (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason, (iii) failure of the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply duly with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher, for errors in interpretation of technical terms, (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof, (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; and (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Banks. 40

In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with the Letters of Credit or any related certificates if taken or omitted in good faith and with reasonable care, shall not put the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any Bank under any resulting liability to the Borrower or relieve the Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder to any such Person. (j) Cash Collateral. If any Extended Letter of Credit is issued or outstanding, the Borrower shall immediately on or prior to the Termination Date, provide the Issuing Bank one or more back-up letters of credit, satisfactory to the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion, in respect of such outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations (the "Backup Letters of Credit") or Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the then outstanding amount of all Letters of Credit Obligations (such outstanding amount determined as of the Termination Date). For purposes hereof, "Cash Collateral" means cash pledged and deposited with or delivered to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Banks, as collateral for such Letter of Credit Obligations, pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (which documents are hereby consented to by the Banks). The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Banks, a security interest in all such cash and all proceeds thereof. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Wachovia. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate outstanding amount of Letter of Credit Obligations, the Borrower will forthwith, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in deposit accounts at Wachovia as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (i) such aggregate outstanding amount of such Letter of Credit Obligations over (ii) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to reimburse the Issuing Bank and may be applied to any other Letter of Credit Obligations as and when due. SECTION 2.17 Increase in Commitments. (a) Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks), the Borrower may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an aggregate amount not exceeding $200,000,000; provided that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000, except in the case of the final request, which may be for the entire remaining amount, and (ii) the Borrower may make a maximum of three such requests. At the time of sending any such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Bank is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Banks). Each Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its pro rata share (based upon its percentage of the current Total Commitments) of such requested increase. Any Bank not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Bank of the Banks' 41
responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Banks pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. "Eligible Assignee" means any (a) Bank; (b) an Affiliate of a Bank; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person) approved by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, and the Borrower; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries; and provided further, however, that an Eligible Assignee shall include only a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or another Person, which, through its Lending Offices, is capable of lending the applicable Alternative Currencies to the Borrower without the imposition of any Taxes or additional Taxes, as the case may be. (b) If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section 2.17, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Banks of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the Increase Effective Date (for further distribution to each Bank) signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving such increase, and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties (1) specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, (2) are no longer true solely as a result of the passage of time, and (3) are limited by exceptions thereto which have been disclosed in writing to the Banks and which have been approved in writing by the Required Banks, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.17, the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.12 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent audited financial statements furnished pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(ii), and (B) no Default exists. The Borrower shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Article VIII) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised pro rata share (based upon the Banks' percentages of the Total Commitments) arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section 2.17; provided that in the case of any Syndicated Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, no such prepayment may be made other than on the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such Loans, unless the Banks consent thereto. (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 9.04 or 9.05 to the contrary. ARTICLE III CONDITIONS TO BORROWINGS SECTION 3.01 Conditions to Effectiveness.

SECTION 4.03 Authorization of Agreement, Loan Documents and Borrowing. The Borrower has the right, power and authority and has taken all necessary corporate and other action to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and each of the other Loan Documents and performance hereof and thereof in accordance with their respective terms. The Notes, when executed and delivered by the Borrower, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar state or federal debtor relief laws from time to time in effect which affect the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and the availability of equitable remedies. This Agreement and each of such other Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the Borrower and each such document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar state or federal debtor relief laws from time to time in effect which affect the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and the availability of equitable remedies. SECTION 4.04 Compliance of Agreement, Loan Documents and Borrowing with Laws, Etc. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, the performance by the Borrower of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents in accordance with their respective terms, the borrowings hereunder, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not, by the passage of time, the giving of notice or otherwise, (i) require any Governmental Approval or violate any Applicable Law relating to the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound or any Governmental Approval relating to such Person or (iii) result in or require 45
the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Person other than Liens arising under the Loan Documents SECTION 4.05 Compliance with Law; Governmental Approvals. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (i) has all Governmental Approvals required by any Applicable Law for it to conduct its business, each of which is in full force and effect, is final and not subject to review on appeal and is not the subject of any pending or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened attack by direct or collateral proceeding and (ii) is in compliance with each Governmental Approval applicable to it and all other Applicable Laws relating to it or any of its respective properties, except, in each case under clause (i) and clause (ii) of this paragraph, to the extent that (A) such requirement or compliance is contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or (B) the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 4.06 Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries has duly filed or caused to be filed all federal and state income tax returns and all other material state, local and other tax returns required by Applicable Law to be filed, and has paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, all federal, state, local and other taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies upon it and its property, income, profits and assets which are due and payable, other than any of the foregoing for which the amount or validity is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower or its Material Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries in respect of federal, state, local and other taxes for all Fiscal Years and portions thereof since the organization of the Borrower and any of its Material Subsidiaries are in the judgment of the Borrower adequate, and the Borrower does not anticipate any additional taxes or assessments in excess of such charges, accruals and reserves previously recorded for any of such years.

SECTION 4.08 Environmental Matters. Except for the matters described on Schedule 4.08 as of the Closing Date and except for any other matter which could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the properties of the Borrower and its 46
Material Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, and to the best knowledge of the Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries there is no release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials at, under or about such properties or such operations which could interfere with the continued operation of such properties or materially impair the fair saleable value thereof and (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its Material Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of its properties or the operations conducted in connection therewith, nor does the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries have knowledge or reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened.

The Borrower and each member of the Controlled Group are in material compliance with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder with respect to all Plans except for any required amendments for which the remedial amendment period as defined in Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired. As of the Closing Date, other than as set forth on Schedule 4.09, each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and each trust related to such Plan has been determined to be exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. No reportable event for which notice is required under ERISA and not otherwise waived by the PBGC has occurred as to which the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group was required to file a report with the PBGC and no material liability (including without limitation any withdrawal liability under Section 4201 of ERISA) has been incurred by the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group which remains unsatisfied for any taxes or penalties with respect to any Plan or any Multiemployer Plan. SECTION 4.10 Margin Stock. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is engaged principally or as one of its activities in the business of extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any Margin Stock. No part of the proceeds of the Loan will be used for purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of such Board of Governors.

SECTION 4.14 Debt and Liens. Schedule 4.14 is a complete and correct list of each item of Consolidated Total Debt of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries in excess of $100,000 (setting forth with respect to each such item the amount and stated maturity of Consolidated Total Debt outstanding, the identity of the Person to whom such Consolidated Total Debt is owed and the date such Consolidated Total Debt was incurred) and each Lien securing any such Debt (setting forth with respect to each such Lien the property subject to such Lien) as of the Closing Date; provided that the aggregate amount of Consolidated Total Debt excluded from this sentence by virtue of being $100,000 or less shall not exceed $5,000,000. The Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all of the terms of such Debt and Liens and all instruments and agreements relating thereto, and no default or event of default, or event or condition which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a default or event of default on the part of the Borrower or its Consolidated Subsidiaries exists with respect to any such Debt or Lien.

SECTION 4.16 Absence of Defaults. No event has occurred or is continuing which constitutes a Default, or which constitutes, or which with the passage of time or giving of notice or both would constitute, a default or event of default by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof under any judgment, decree or order involving an amount owed by the Borrower or a 48
Subsidiary in excess of $10,000,000 by which the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or which would require the Borrower or its Subsidiaries to make any payment thereunder prior to the scheduled maturity date therefor. SECTION 4.17 Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written information, reports and other papers and data produced by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof and furnished to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the Banks (including without limitation a copy of Form 10-K for the Borrower's Fiscal Year ended May 29, 2005, filed by the Borrower with the SEC) were, at the time the same were so furnished, complete and correct in all material respects and, when taken as a whole, do not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances in which they were made.

The Issuing Bank and each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as its Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent: (a) shall have no duties or responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for the Issuing Bank or any Bank; (b) makes no warranty or representation to the Issuing Bank or any Bank and shall not be responsible to the Issuing Bank or the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Bank under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by the Required Banks, and then only on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (d) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

The provisions of this Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks, and the Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Issuing Bank and the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrower regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing.

As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks in any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks. SECTION 7.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or interest on the Loans) unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Issuing Bank, a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Issuing Bank and the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 9.05) take such action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Required Banks, provided that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Issuing Bank and the Banks. SECTION 7.04 Rights of Administrative Agent and its Affiliates as a Bank. With respect to its Commitment and the Loans and any Letter of Credit made or issued by it and any of its Affiliates, Wachovia (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent hereunder) in its capacity as a Bank and the Issuing Bank hereunder, and any Affiliate of Wachovia in its capacity as a Bank and the Issuing Bank hereunder, shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Administrative Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include Wachovia in its individual capacity and any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. Wachovia (and any successor acting as Administrative Agent hereunder) and any Affiliate thereof may (without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower (and any of the Borrower's Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, and Wachovia and any Affiliate thereof may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks. SECTION 7.05 Indemnification. Each Bank severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, to the extent the Administrative Agent shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower, ratably in accordance with its Commitment, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents 60
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, the normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or any such other documents; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. SECTION 7.06 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY BANK, THE ISSUING BANK, THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. SECTION 7.07 Payee of Note Treated as Owner. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and the provisions of Section 9.07(c) have been satisfied. Any requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of that Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor or replacement thereof. SECTION 7.08 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks. The Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself (or the Issuing Bank or any Bank) informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any other Person. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Issuing Bank and/or the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide the Issuing Bank or any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower or any other Person (or any of their Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent. SECTION 7.09 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent 61
shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction by the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent by reason of taking, continuing to take, or failing to take any such action. SECTION 7.10 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Issuing Bank, the Banks and the Borrower; provided that any such resignation by the Administrative Agent shall also constitute its resignation of Wachovia as the Issuing Bank. Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent with the consent of the Borrower (unless a Default has occurred and is then existing, in which case the consent of the Borrower shall not be required), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation, such resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) the Required Banks shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank directly) until such time as the Required Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder. SECTION 7.11 Other Agents. The Borrower, the Issuing Bank and each other Bank hereby acknowledge that any Bank designated as an "Agent" on the signature pages hereof (other than the Administrative Agent) shall not have any obligations, duties or liabilities hereunder other than in its capacity as a Bank or Issuing Bank as applicable. ARTICLE VIII CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION SECTION 8.01 Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits in any Applicable Currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or 62
(b) the Required Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding Eurocurrency Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make Eurocurrency Loans specified in such notice, or to permit continuations of or conversions into Eurocurrency Loans, shall be suspended. Unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two (2) Business Days before the date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given, or continuation or conversion into such Eurocurrency Loans for which a Notice of Continuation or Conversion has previously been given, that it elects not to borrow or so continue or convert on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as or continue to be a Base Rate Borrowing denominated in the Applicable Currency, or such Eurocurrency Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan denominated in the Applicable Currency. SECTION 8.02 Illegality. If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any existing or future Applicable Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, in each case having general application to financial institutions of the same classification as an affected Bank or Issuing Bank (any such event being referred to as a "Change of Law"), or compliance by any Bank or the Issuing Bank (or such Bank's or Issuing Bank's Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank or the Issuing Bank (or such Bank's or Issuing Bank's Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Eurocurrency Loans or Letters of Credit in any Applicable Currency or purchase or sell or take deposits of any Applicable Currency in the applicable interbank market, and such Bank or Issuing Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank or the Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank or Issuing Bank to make Letters of Credit or to make or permit continuations of or conversions into Eurocurrency Loans in such Applicable Currency shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.02, such Issuing Bank or Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Issuing Bank or Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Issuing Bank or Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Eurocurrency Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each Eurocurrency Loan of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon and any amount due such Bank pursuant to Section 8.05(a). Concurrently with prepaying each such Eurocurrency Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Eurocurrency Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan. 63
SECTION 8.03 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by the Issuing Bank or any Bank (or the Issuing Bank's or any Bank's Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Authority: (i) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding, with respect to any Letter of Credit, any Eurocurrency Loan, any such requirement included in an applicable Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, the Issuing Bank or any Bank (or the Issuing Bank's or any Bank's Lending Office); or (ii) shall impose on the Issuing Bank or any Bank (or the Issuing Bank's or any Bank's Lending Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, any Letter of Credit or its participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Issuing Bank or Bank (or such Issuing Bank's or Bank's Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Loan or Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Issuing Bank or Bank to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after written demand by such Issuing Bank or Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) specifying in reasonable detail such Issuing Bank's or Bank's calculations as to the amount owed to such Issuing Bank or Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank or Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing Bank or Bank for such increased cost or reduction, provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such amount which is attributable to any period of time occurring more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date of receipt by the Borrower of such demand. (b) If any Issuing Bank or Bank shall have determined that after the date hereof the adoption of any Applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any existing or future Applicable Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Issuing Bank or any Bank (or the Issuing Bank's or any Bank's Lending Office or the bank holding company of which such Issuing Bank or Bank is a subsidiary) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Issuing Bank or Bank's (or such bank holding company's) capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Issuing Bank or Bank (or such bank holding company) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Issuing Bank or Bank's (or such bank holding company's) policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Issuing Bank or Bank to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after written demand by such Issuing Bank or Bank specifying in reasonable detail such Issuing Bank or Bank's calculations as to the amount owed to such Issuing Bank or Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Bank or Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing Bank or Bank for such reduction, 64
provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such amount which is attributable to any period of time occurring more than one hundred eight (180) days prior to the date of receipt by the Borrower of such demand. (c) The Issuing Bank and each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Issuing Bank or Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.03 and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Issuing Bank or Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Issuing Bank or Bank. A certificate of the Issuing Bank or any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Issuing Bank or Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. (d) The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be applicable with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions shall be made based upon the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or other Transferee. SECTION 8.04 Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Eurocurrency Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03, and the Borrower shall, by at least five (5) Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply: (a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as, or permitted to be continued as or converted into, Eurocurrency Loans shall instead be made as, continue to be or converted into Base Rate Loans (in all cases interest and principal on such Loans shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Eurocurrency Loans of the other Banks), and (b) after each of its Eurocurrency Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Eurocurrency Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead. In the event that the Borrower shall elect that the provisions of this Section shall apply to any Bank, the Borrower shall remain liable for, and shall pay to such Bank as provided herein, all amounts due such Bank under Section 8.03 in respect of the period preceding the date of conversion of such Bank's Loans resulting from the Borrower's election. SECTION 8.05 Compensation. Upon the request of any Bank, delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amount or amounts as shall compensate such Bank for any loss, cost or expense (including any foreign exchange loss) incurred by such Bank as a result of: (a) any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.11, Section 8.02 or otherwise) of a Eurocurrency Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan; 65
(b) any failure by the Borrower to prepay a Eurocurrency Loan on the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant notice of prepayment hereunder; (c) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Eurocurrency Loan on the date for the Eurocurrency Borrowing of which such Eurocurrency Loan is a part specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.02; or (d) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so paid or prepaid or not prepaid or borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment or failure to prepay or borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan (or, in the case of a failure to prepay or borrow, the Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to prepay or borrow) at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurocurrency Loan provided for herein over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) such Bank would have paid on deposits in Dollars of comparable amounts having terms comparable to such period placed with it by leading banks in the London interbank market. SECTION 8.06 Replacement of Banks. If any Bank (a "Notice Bank") makes demand for amounts owed under Section 8.03 (other than due to any change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage), or gives notice under Section 8.02 that it can no longer participate in Eurocurrency Loans, then in each case the Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default exists, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 9.07(c), to designate an assignee (a "Replacement Bank") to purchase the Notice Bank's share of outstanding Loans and all other obligations hereunder and to assume the Notice Bank's obligations to the Borrower under this Agreement; provided, that, any Replacement Bank must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Required Banks (and, in any event, may not be an Affiliate of the Borrower). Subject to the foregoing, the Notice Bank agrees to assign without recourse to the Replacement Bank its share of outstanding Loans and its Commitment, and to delegate to the Replacement Bank its obligations to the Borrower under this Agreement and its future obligations to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Upon such sale and delegation by the Notice Bank and the purchase and assumption by the Replacement Bank, and compliance with the provisions of Section 9.07(c), the Notice Bank shall cease to be a "Bank" hereunder and the Replacement Bank shall become a "Bank" under this Agreement; provided, however, that any Notice Bank shall continue to be entitled to the indemnification provisions contained elsewhere herein.

Each Bank that is a party to this Agreement as of the Closing Date acknowledges and agrees that it is capable of receiving notices under Article II by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant 67
to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.

SECTION 9.02 No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note or other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Documentary Taxes; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder or thereunder or any amendment hereof or thereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder or thereunder and (ii) if a Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank, including fees and disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Default and collection and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom, including out-of-pocket expenses incurred in enforcing this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank against any transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Authority by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Banks and each Affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit by the Issuing Bank or any Bank hereunder or breach by the Borrower of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or from any investigation, litigation (including, without limitation, any actions taken by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any of the Banks to enforce this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents) or other proceeding (including, without 68
limitation, any threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, and the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank, and each Affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation or proceeding; but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses which are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court to have been incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified. In the case of any investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.03 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof, or any of their respective directors, shareholders, or creditors or an Indemnified Party, or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document is consummated. A Person seeking to be indemnified under this Section 9.03 shall notify the Borrower of any event arising out of any legal action or proceeding requiring indemnification within thirty (30) days following such Person's receipt of notice of commencement of such legal action or proceeding and the Borrower shall be given the opportunity to participate (at its own cost and expense) in the defense of, and any settlement negotiations entered into in connection with, any such legal action or proceeding. Without in any way limiting Section 7.06, the Borrower agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, not to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Bank, any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents and advisors, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of any of the Loans or the Letters of Credit. SECTION 9.04 Setoffs; Sharing of Set-Offs. (a) The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank a lien for all indebtedness and obligations owing to them from the Borrower upon all deposits or deposit accounts, of any kind, or any interest in any deposits or deposit accounts thereof, now or hereafter pledged, mortgaged, transferred or assigned to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Bank or otherwise in the possession or control of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Bank for any purpose for the account or benefit of the Borrower and including any balance of any deposit account or of any credit of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Bank, whether now existing or hereafter established, authorizing the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank at any time or times with or without prior notice to apply such balances or any part thereof to such of the indebtedness and obligations owing by the Borrower to such Bank, the Issuing Bank and/or the Administrative Agent then past due and in such amounts as they may elect, and whether or not the collateral, if any, or the responsibility of other Persons primarily, secondarily or otherwise liable may be deemed adequate. The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Bank, as applicable, shall promptly notify Borrower of such application; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity or legality of such application. For the purposes of this paragraph, all remittances and property shall be deemed to be in the possession of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Bank as soon as the same may be put in transit to it by mail or carrier or by other bailee. 69
(b) Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or resort to collateral security or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest owing with respect to the Notes held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of all principal and interest owing with respect to the Notes held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Notes held by the other Banks owing to such other Banks, and/or such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks owing to such other Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that (i) nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness under the Notes, and (ii) if all or any portion of such payment received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each other Bank shall be rescinded and such other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price of such participation to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such other Bank's required repayment to (y) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. (c) Prior to the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply all payments and prepayments in respect of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in such order as shall be specified by the Borrower. After the occurrence of a Default, the Administrative Agent shall, unless otherwise specified at the direction of the Required Banks which direction shall be consistent with the last two sentences of this paragraph (c), apply all payments and prepayments in respect of any obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and all proceeds of collateral, if any, in the following order: (i) first, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion of the Loans which the Administrative Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Bank for which the Administrative Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Bank or the Borrower; (ii) second, to pay obligations of the Borrower in respect of any fees, expenses, reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Administrative Agent; (iii) third, to pay obligations of the Borrower in respect of any fees, expenses, reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Banks or the Issuing Bank; (iv) fourth, to pay interest due in respect of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations; 70
(v) fifth, to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal outstanding on Loans and Reimbursement Obligations in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine in its sole discretion; (vi) sixth, to provide Cash Collateral, if required pursuant to Section 6.01; and (vii) seventh, to the ratable payment of all other obligations of the Borrower. Unless otherwise designated (which designation shall only be applicable prior to the occurrence of a Default) by the Borrower, all principal payments in respect of Loans shall be applied first, to repay outstanding Base Rate Loans, and then to repay outstanding Eurocurrency Loans with those Loans which have earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those which have later expiring Interest Periods. The order of priority set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (c) and the related provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the Administrative Agent. The order of priority set forth in clauses (iii) through (vii) of this paragraph (c) may at any time and from time to time be changed by the Required Banks without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by the Borrower, or any other Person; provided that the order of payments in respect of fees payable to the Issuing Bank may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Issuing Bank. The order of priority set forth in clauses (i) through (ii) of this paragraph (c) may be changed only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. SECTION 9.05 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent and, if the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank are affected thereby, by the Issuing Bank); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by each Bank directly affected thereby, (i) increase the Commitment of any Bank or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or reduce the rate of interest on any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder (other than fees payable to the Administrative Agent), (iii) extend the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or any fees hereunder, (iv) reduce the amount of principal, interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof, (v) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the percentage of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement, (vi) change the manner of application of any payments made under this Agreement or the Notes, (vii) release or substitute all or any substantial part of the collateral (if any) held as security for the Loans or the Letter of Credit Obligations, or (viii) release any guaranty given to support payment of the Loans or the Letter of Credit Obligations or (ix) change Section 9.07(c) without the consent of each Bank that has assigned all or a portion of its Commitment, Loans or participation in any Letter of Credit to one or more Approved Funds. SECTION 9.06 Independence of Covenants. All covenants under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would be otherwise allowed by, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is taken or such condition exists. 71
SECTION 9.07 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank and no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (b) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, Issuing Bank shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to Section 9.05 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Article VIII than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13(c) unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.13(d) and 2.13(e) as though it were a Bank. (c) Upon written notice to the Borrower delivered at least one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed date of assignment, any Bank may at any time assign to one or more assignees 72
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and (ii) in any case not described in paragraph (c)(i) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). (iii) Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of Money Market Loans. (iv) No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section and, in addition: (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund; (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (i) a Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Bank with a Commitment in respect of such facility, an Affiliate of such Bank or an Approved Fund with respect to such Bank or (ii) the Loans (if no Commitments exist) to a Person who is not a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund; and (C) the consent of the Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding). (v) The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and 73
recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment, and the assignee, if it is not a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (vi) No such assignment shall be made to the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries. (vii) No such assignment may be made to any of the Borrower's competitors or any of their respective Affiliates. (viii) No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII and Section 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section. (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.08, the Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant, Assignee or other transferee (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the Borrower which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower in connection with such Bank's credit evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement. (e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist. (f) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. (g) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Charlotte, North Carolina a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and 74
addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. SECTION 9.08 Confidentiality. The Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees to exercise its best efforts to keep any information delivered or made available by the Borrower to it which is clearly indicated to be confidential information, confidential from anyone other than persons employed or retained by such Issuing Bank or Bank who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the Loans; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the Issuing Bank or any Bank from disclosing such information (i) to the Issuing Bank (as applicable) or any other Bank or to an Affiliate of such Issuing Bank or Bank, (ii) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank or Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, or under any Hedging Agreement to which the Issuing Bank, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a party or the credit support therefor (vii) to such Issuing Bank's or Bank's legal counsel and independent auditors and (viii) to any actual or proposed Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of all or part of its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.08; provided that should disclosure of any such confidential information be required by virtue of clause (ii) or (v) of this sentence, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the relevant Issuing Bank or any relevant Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of the same and shall reasonably cooperate in any effort of the Borrower to maintain the confidentiality of such confidential information, including to allow the Borrower to seek a protective order or to take any appropriate action; provided, further, that neither the Issuing Bank nor any Bank shall be required to delay compliance with any directive to disclose any such information so as to allow Borrower to effect any such action. The Issuing Bank and each Bank acknowledges that it is aware that United States securities laws prohibit any person who has material, nonpublic information concerning the Borrower from purchasing or selling securities of the Borrower or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. The Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees that the provisions of this paragraph constitute a confidentiality agreement within the meaning of Rule 100(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation FD. SECTION 9.09 Representation by Banks. Each Bank hereby represents that it is a commercial lender or financial institution which makes loans in the ordinary course of its business and that it will make its Loans hereunder for its own account in the ordinary course of such business; provided, however, that, subject to Section 9.07, the disposition of the Note or Notes held by that Bank shall at all times be within its exclusive control. SECTION 9.10 Obligations Several. The obligations of the Issuing Bank and each Bank hereunder are several, and neither the Issuing Bank nor any Bank shall be responsible for 75
the obligations or commitment of the Issuing Bank or any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the Issuing Bank or Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Issuing Bank or any of the Banks to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to the Issuing Bank and each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt, and the Issuing Bank and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and it shall not be necessary for the Issuing Bank or any other Bank to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. SECTION 9.11 Survival of Certain Obligations. Sections 2.16(j), 8.03(a), 8.03(b), 8.05 and 9.03, and the obligations of the Borrower thereunder, shall survive, and shall continue to be enforceable notwithstanding, the termination of this Agreement and the Commitments and the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans and Reimbursement Obligations. SECTION 9.12 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS THEREOF OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SECTION 9.13 Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law. SECTION 9.14 Interest. In no event shall the amount of interest, and all charges, amounts or fees contracted for, charged or collected pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents and deemed to be interest under applicable law (collectively, "Interest") exceed the highest rate of interest allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"), and in the event any such payment is inadvertently received by any Bank, then the excess sum (the "Excess") shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify such Bank in writing that it elects to have the Excess returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof that the Borrower not pay and the Banks not receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may legally be paid by the Borrower under applicable law. The right to accelerate maturity of any of the Loans does not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Administrative Agent and the Banks do not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event of any such acceleration. All monies paid to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Banks hereunder or under any of the Notes or the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment, shall be subject to rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by applicable law. By the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower covenants, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by the Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) the Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank, based in whole or in part upon contracting for charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted 76
for, charged or received by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrower in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of the Commitments. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. The provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be incorporated into each Note and each of the other Loan Documents (whether or not any provision of this Section 9.14 is referred to therein). All such Loan Documents and communications relating to any Interest owed by the Borrower and all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole purpose of computing the extent of obligations hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents be automatically recomputed by the Borrower, and by any court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments or credits required by this Section 9.14. SECTION 9.15 Interpretation. No provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other governmental or judicial authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured or dictated such provision. SECTION 9.16 Jurisdiction, Etc.; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in the courts of any jurisdiction. (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (c) Each of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents to which it is a party or the actions of the Administrative 77
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Bank in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof. SECTION 9.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. SECTION 9.18 Source of Funds - ERISA. Each of the Banks hereby severally (and not jointly) represents to the Borrower that no part of the funds to be used by such Bank to fund the Loans hereunder from time to time constitutes (i) assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such Bank in which any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest nor (ii) any other assets of any employee benefit plan. As used in this Section, the terms "employee benefit plan" and "separate account" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3 of ERISA. SECTION 9.19 Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from them to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Banks hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and/or the Banks from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Banks or such other Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and/or the Banks in such currency, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Banks agree to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable Law). SECTION 9.20 FIN 46. For purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants in this Agreement, the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 shall be disregarded with respect to financial consolidation of any entity that is not a Subsidiary of the Borrower. SECTION 9.21 USA Patriot Act. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and any Bank that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56) (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act") hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower 78
and other information that will allow such Bank to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. [THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.] 79

EXHIBIT E OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER [Dated as provided in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement] To the Banks and the Administrative Agent, Referred to Below c/o Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent One Wachovia Center 301 South College Street Charlotte, North Carolina 28288-0680 Attention: Syndication Agency Services Dear Sirs: I have acted as counsel for Darden Restaurants, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Borrower"), in my capacity as Senior Associate General Counsel of the Borrower, in connection with the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of August 16, 2005, among the Borrower, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined. I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. As to questions of fact relating to the Borrower material to this opinion, I have relied upon representations of appropriate officers of the Borrower. I have assumed for purposes of my opinions set forth below, with the permission of the Administrative Agent and the Banks and without verification: (a) the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, (b) the genuineness of all signatures, (c) the legal capacity of natural persons, (d) the conformity to originals of all documents submitted to me as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies, (e) the accuracy as to factual matters of the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement, (f) that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement have been satisfied or waived, E-1
(g) that the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by each Bank and by the Administrative Agent have been duly authorized by each Bank and by the Administrative Agent, and (h) that the Credit Agreement is enforceable against the Administrative Agent and the Bank in accordance with its terms. I am qualified to practice in the State of Florida and do not purport to be an expert on any laws other than the laws of the United States and the State of Florida and this opinion is rendered only with respect to such laws. I have made no independent investigation of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. 2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes (i) are within the Borrower's corporate powers, (ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official, (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument which to my knowledge is binding upon the Borrower, and (v) to my knowledge, except as provided in the Credit Agreement, do not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 3. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, and the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. 4. To my knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or threatened, against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner questions the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note. 5. Each of the Borrower's Material Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted. 6. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. E-2
7. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. 8. The choice of New York law to govern the Credit Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents in which such choice is stipulated is a valid and effective choice of law under the law of the State of Florida, and adherence to existing judicial precedents generally would require a court sitting in the State of Florida to abide by such choice of law. Such courts might not give effect to such choice of law provisions if giving effect to such provisions were determined to be contrary to a fundamental policy of the State of Florida at such time, but I am not aware of any existing precedent refusing to give effect to a choice of law provision in a substantial commercial contract on purely public policy grounds. I am not aware of any provision of the Credit Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents which would violate a fundamental policy of the State of Florida. In addition, I have assumed for the purposes of this opinion that in selecting New York law the parties are acting in good faith and without an intent to evade the law of Florida. My opinions set forth above are subject to the following additional qualifications: (a) I express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of Florida and the United States) wherein any Bank may be located which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Bank. (b) I wish to point out that the provisions of the Credit Agreement that permit the Administrative Agent or any Bank to take action or make determinations, or to benefit from indemnities and similar undertakings of the Borrower, may be subject to a requirement that such action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or a Bank which may give rise to a request for payment under such an undertaking be taken or not taken on a reasonable basis and in good faith. (c) My opinions are subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, statutes of limitation, or other similar laws and judicial decisions affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally, and are further subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, estoppel, election of remedies and other similar doctrines affecting the enforcement of agreements generally (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). In addition, the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver or other equitable remedies is subject to the discretion of the tribunal before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. (d) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions of the Credit Agreement to the extent it contains: (i) choice of law or forum selection provisions except as set forth in paragraph 8, above, (ii) waivers by the Borrower of any statutory or constitutional rights or remedies, E-3
(iii) grants to the Administrative Agent or the Banks of powers of attorney, (iv) cumulative remedies to the extent such cumulative remedies purport to compensate, or would have the effect of compensating, the party entitled to the benefits thereof in an amount in excess of the actual loss suffered by such party, (v) obligations of the Borrower to pay any prepayment premium, default interest rate, early termination fee or other form of liquidated damages, if the payment of such premium, interest rate, fee or damages may be construed as unreasonable in relation to actual damages or disproportionate to actual damages suffered by the Banks as a result of such prepayment, default or termination, (vi) terms purporting to establish evidentiary standards, or (vii) terms to the effect that provisions in the Credit Agreement may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances. (e) I express no opinion as to compliance or the effect of noncompliance by the Administrative Agent or any Bank with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the Administrative Agent or such Bank in connection with the transactions described in the Credit Agreement. The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. This opinion is solely for the benefit of the addressees hereof in connection with the transaction described in the first paragraph of this letter, may not be relied upon by the addressee hereof for any other purpose, and may not be relied upon or used by, circulated, quoted, or referred to, nor may copies hereof be delivered to, another person, other than the Administrative Agent's and the Banks' participants and assigns permitted under the Agreement, for any purpose without my prior written approval; provided that copies hereof may be provided by a Bank to its auditors and counsel and to any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over such Bank. I disclaim any obligation to update this opinion letter for events occurring or coming to my attention, or any changes in the law taking effect, after the date hereof.
