Exhibit 99 DARDEN RESTAURANTS Red Lobster(R) Olive Garden(R) Bahama Breeze(R) Smokey Bones(R) www.darden.com NEWS/INFORMATION Corporate Relations P.O. Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Jim DeSimone(407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE September 22, 2005 4:30 PM ET DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS A 20% INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE TO 53 CENTS; INCREASES SEMI-ANNUAL DIVIDEND 400% TO 20 CENTS PER SHARE; RE-AFFIRMS ANNUAL EARNINGS GUIDANCE ORLANDO, FL, September 22 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) today reported sales of $1.41 billion for the first quarter ended August 28, 2005, and quarterly diluted net earnings per share of 53 cents, up 20% from prior year. The Company also increased its semi-annual dividend to 20 cents per share. This represents a 400% increase from the previous 4 cents per share semi-annual dividend. "This was an outstanding quarter, with industry leading sales and earnings growth," said Clarence Otis, Darden's Chief Executive Officer. "This strong start to the fiscal year speaks to the inherent strength of our brands and our restaurant and restaurant support teams, who bring those brands to life. Our people are skilled and well-trained, but it's their passion for nourishing and delighting everyone we serve that is at the heart of this organization. It motivates our teams to provide excellent yet continuously improving experiences to our guests. It's evident in the many things our teams are doing to assist members of the Darden family and others in our communities who have been severely affected by recent hurricanes. And it will enable us to fulfill our mission of being the best in casual dining now and for generations" Highlights for the quarter ended August 28, 2005, include the following: o Net earnings in the first quarter were $85.5 million, or 53 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.41 billion. Last year, net earnings were $71.0 million, or 44 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.28 billion. o Total sales of $1.41 billion represent a 10.2% increase over prior year. o Olive Garden achieved its 44th consecutive quarter of U.S. same-restaurant sales growth with a 7.4% increase. o Red Lobster had U.S. same-restaurant sales growth of 5.7% for the quarter, well above the estimated Knapp-Track industry average excluding Darden. -MORE-
-2- o The Company continued its share repurchases, buying back 4.1 million shares of its common stock in the quarter. o The Company's Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of 20 cents per share, a 400% increase from the previous semi-annual 4 cents per share. o The Company's Board of Directors also elected Clarence Otis, Jr., Darden's Chief Executive Officer, to the additional position of Chairman of Darden effective November 29, 2005. o The Company re-affirmed its annual guidance for low double-digit range diluted net earnings per share growth. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S first quarter sales of $643.5 million were 10.8% above prior year, driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 7.4% and revenue from 21 net new restaurants in operation versus last year. This is the 44th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden and builds on a 2.8% increase in the first quarter of last year. The company's increased sales, combined with lower food and beverage costs, restaurant expenses and depreciation expenses as a percent of sales, more than offset increased restaurant labor costs and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Olive Garden had a record quarterly profit that also represents double-digit operating profit growth over last year. RED LOBSTER'S first quarter sales of $634.1 million were 6.6% above prior year, reflecting a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 5.7%. The company's increased sales and lower food and beverage costs and depreciation expenses as a percent of sales more than offset higher restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. As a result, operating profits increased at a strong double-digit percentage rate over last year. BAHAMA BREEZE'S same-restaurant sales declined 0.4% in the first quarter, primarily as a result of a changing sales mix. The company continued to implement key elements of its turnaround plan, which led to increased operating profits over last year. SMOKEY BONES first quarter sales of $81.7 million were 46% above prior year as a result of 34 more restaurants in operation, including seven restaurants that were opened during the first quarter, and a same-restaurant sales decline of 0.1%. Restaurant level operating profit increased 73% as increased sales combined with lower food and beverage costs and restaurant expenses offset increased restaurant labor costs on a percent of sales basis. "We are very pleased with our operating performance this quarter," said Drew Madsen, President and Chief Operating Officer of Darden. "Once again, Olive Garden led the way with strong sales and operating profit growth. Red Lobster continued to show strong improvement in its guest experience, same-restaurant sales and operating profit growth. And, Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones demonstrated solid improvement in their operating results. We are excited about the progress we have made this quarter in strengthening and improving the performance of all our operating companies, which is creating a solid foundation for accelerated future growth." -MORE-
-3- Other Actions Darden continued the buyback of its common stock, purchasing 4.1 million shares in the first quarter. Since commencing its share repurchases in December 1995, the Company has repurchased a total of 124.6 million shares under authorizations totaling 137.4 million shares. Darden's Board of Directors declared an increase in the cash dividend to 20 cents per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on November 1, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2005. Based on this 20-cent semi-annual dividend declaration, the Company's indicated annual dividend is 40 cents per share. Previously, the Company had paid a semi-annual dividend of 4 cents per share. The Company's Board of Directors also elected Clarence Otis, Jr., Darden's Chief Executive Officer, to the additional position of Chairman of Darden effective November 29, 2005. Otis replaces Joe R. Lee, Darden's Chairman of the Board and founding Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Darden since 1995, who is retiring. Lee led the company for 38 years as it grew from a single Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida in 1968, into the largest company owned and operated publicly traded casual dining restaurant company in the world. Fiscal August 2006 U.S. Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden reported U.S. same-restaurant sales for the four-week fiscal August ended August 28, 2005. This period is the last month of Darden's fiscal 2006 first quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up 7% to 8% for fiscal August. The increase reflected a 6% to 7% increase in guest counts and a 1% to 2% increase in check average. The check average increase was a result of an approximate 2% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1% decrease from menu mix changes. Last year, Olive Garden had a 2% to 3% decrease in same-restaurant sales during fiscal August. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster increased 3% to 4% for fiscal August. This reflected a 2% to 3% increase in guest counts and a 0% to 1% increase in check average. The check average increase was a result of an approximate 1% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1% decline from menu mix changes. Last year, Red Lobster had an approximate 16% decrease in same-restaurant sales during fiscal August. Fiscal 2006 Outlook The Company estimates that Hurricane Katrina, which occurred in fiscal September, will adversely affect September U.S. same-restaurant sales results at both Red Lobster and Olive Garden by approximately 0.1%. For the full fiscal year, total sales for Darden are expected to be adversely affected by $16.0 to $17.0 million and the effect on operating profit is expected to be minimal. There are currently five restaurants (three Olive Gardens and two Red Lobsters) that are closed indefinitely; two (one Red Lobster and one Olive Garden) were total losses and the three others incurred significant damage. Decisions regarding rebuilding and reopening are pending clean-up and recovery efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi. -MORE-
-4- The Company re-affirmed its sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2006. The Company continues to expect diluted net earnings per share growth for fiscal 2006 in the low double-digit range based on its continued expectation of combined U.S. same-restaurant sales growth of 2% to 4% for Red Lobster and Olive Garden and new unit growth of approximately 4% to 5%.
