Exhibit 99 DARDEN RESTAURANTS Red Lobster(R) Olive Garden(R) Bahama Breeze(R) Smokey Bones(R) www.darden.com NEWS/INFORMATION Corporate Affairs P.O. Box 593330 Orlando, FL 32859 Contacts: (Analysts) Matthew Stroud (407) 245-6458 (Media) Jim DeSimone (407) 245-4567 FOR RELEASE March 21, 2006 4:30 PM ET DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 67 CENTS, UP 20% FROM PRIOR YEAR; DECLARES DIVIDEND OF 20 CENTS PER SHARE ORLANDO, FL, March 21 - Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) today reported sales of $1.47 billion for the third quarter ended February 26, 2006, and quarterly diluted net earnings per share of 67 cents, up 20% from prior year. "This was a strong quarter for Darden," said Clarence Otis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Darden. "We had outstanding financial results despite some difficult prior year comparisons, driven by continued strength at Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Throughout this fiscal year, both have demonstrated the power of combining effective brand management and continuously improving in-restaurant excellence. With this solid foundation, we expect continued momentum into the fourth quarter and beyond. We also had good progress at Smokey Bones and Bahama Breeze, as they work to become more broadly appealing. Our direction is clear - we are passionately focused on nourishing and delighting everyone we serve, so we earn the distinction of being the best in casual dining, now and for generations." Highlights for the quarter ended February 26, 2006, include the following: o Net earnings in the third quarter were $105.3 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.47 billion. Last year, net earnings were $92.6 million, or 56 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.38 billion. o Total sales of $1.47 billion represent a 7.1% increase over prior year. o Olive Garden achieved its 46th consecutive quarter of U.S. same-restaurant sales growth with a 5.7% increase. o Red Lobster's U.S. same-restaurant sales growth was 1.6% for the quarter, its 6th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth, despite the shift of Lent and Red Lobster's signature Lobsterfest into this year's fourth quarter, which adversely affected same-restaurant sales by an estimated two percentage points. -MORE-
-2- o The Company incurred costs to resolve legal disputes in California related to the exempt classification of certain managerial employees, which reduced diluted net earnings per share by approximately four cents. The Company also incurred costs related to the impairment of five Smokey Bones restaurants, which reduced diluted net earnings per share by approximately three cents. o The Company's tax rate this quarter was lower than anticipated and lower than reflected in its previously announced expectations for the 2006 fiscal year due to the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and higher than projected tax credits. These items benefited diluted earnings per share for the quarter by approximately six cents. o The Company continued its share repurchases, buying back over 3.7 million shares of its common stock in the quarter. o The Company revised upwards its earnings guidance for fiscal 2006 and now expects diluted net earnings per share growth to be at the top of its previously announced 15% to 20% growth range. Operating Highlights OLIVE GARDEN'S third quarter sales of $689.0 million were 9.8% above prior year, driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 5.7% and revenue from 19 net new restaurants in operation versus last year. This is the 46th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth for Olive Garden and builds on a 10.5% increase in the third quarter of last year. The company's increased sales, combined with lower food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales, more than offset increased restaurant and depreciation expenses as a percent of sales. Olive Garden had record third quarter operating profit that also represented double-digit operating profit growth over last year. RED LOBSTER'S third quarter sales of $651.7 million were 2.5% above prior year, driven primarily by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 1.6%. Red Lobster's same-restaurant sales results reflect a three week shift in the start of its Lobsterfest promotion, which commenced in the third quarter last year versus the fourth quarter this year. The company's increased sales and lower food and beverage costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation expenses as a percent of sales more than offset higher restaurant labor costs and restaurant expenses as a percent of sales. Red Lobster had record third quarter operating profit that represented solid growth over last year. BAHAMA BREEZE'S third quarter sales totaled $38.2 million, a 1.8% increase from prior year. Same-restaurant sales also increased 1.7% in the third quarter, primarily because of higher guest counts than last year as the company continued to successfully implement key elements of its turnaround plan. SMOKEY BONES third quarter sales of $88.5 million were 23.1% above prior year primarily because of 27 more restaurants in operation, including nine restaurants that were opened during the third quarter. Smokey Bones' same-restaurant sales declined 5.0% in the quarter. Restaurant level operating profit increased 34% as a result of the increased number of restaurants in operation combined with lower food and beverage costs and restaurant expenses as a percent of sales, offset partially by increased restaurant labor costs as a percent of sales. -MORE-
-3- "We again achieved solid operating performance improvement this quarter while also strengthening our foundation for future growth," said Drew Madsen, President and Chief Operating Officer of Darden. "Olive Garden combined strong guest satisfaction with brand building promotions and took further steps to position their business for accelerated unit growth. Red Lobster guest satisfaction and restaurant level returns both improved versus prior year, providing a strong platform to support continued growth in guest traffic to historical levels. Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones also made progress executing their respective plans to broaden appeal and strengthen their business model. We are confident they are taking the appropriate action to fully realize their potential." Other Actions Darden announced today that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 20 cents per share on the Company's outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 10, 2006. Based on this 20-cent semi-annual dividend declaration, the Company's indicated annual dividend is 40 cents per share. Darden continued the buyback of its common stock, purchasing over 3.7 million shares in the third quarter. Since commencing its share repurchases in December 1995, the Company has repurchased 130.2 million shares under authorizations totaling 137.4 million shares. Fiscal February 2006 U.S. Same-Restaurant Sales Results Darden reported U.S. same-restaurant sales for the four-week fiscal February ended February 26, 2006. This period is the last month of Darden's fiscal 2006 third quarter. Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden were up approximately 3% for fiscal February. The increase reflected a 1% increase in guest counts and a 2% increase in check average. The check average increase was a result of an approximate 2% increase in pricing. Last year, Olive Garden had a 13% increase in same-restaurant sales for fiscal February. Same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster fell 7% to 8% for fiscal February. This reflected an approximate 7% decrease in guest counts and a 1% decline in check average. The check average decrease was a result of an approximate 1% increase in pricing and 2% decrease in menu mix changes. Last year, Red Lobster had a 9% to 10% increase in same-restaurant sales for the fiscal month. The Company estimates that this year's shift in the start of Lent from fiscal February last year to fiscal March this year, and the resulting shift in the start of Lobsterfest, negatively affected same-restaurant sales results at Red Lobster in February by approximately six percentage points. The Company will benefit from this holiday and promotional calendar shift in fiscal March and fiscal April. Additionally, the Company estimates that adverse winter weather negatively affected same-restaurant sales results at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster by approximately one percentage point. -MORE-
-4- Fiscal 2006 Outlook The Company revised upward its sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2006. The Company now expects diluted net earnings per share growth for fiscal 2006 to be at the top of its previously announced 15% to 20% growth range based on its expectation of combined U.S. same-restaurant sales growth of approximately 5% for Red Lobster and Olive Garden, and new unit growth of approximately 4%.
