DARDEN RESTAURANTS REPORTS 17% SECOND QUARTER
DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH
 
ORLANDO, FL, Dec. 19  Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) today reported diluted net earnings per share for the second quarter ended November 26, 2006. For the second quarter, diluted net earnings per share were 41 cents, a 17% increase over the prior year, on net earnings of $61.7 million. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS 123R) on the modified prospective basis, which reduced diluted net earnings per share by $0.02 in the second quarter. The Company reported that second quarter sales increased 4.5% to $1.39 billion, driven primarily by same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden and Red Lobster and new restaurant growth at Olive Garden and Smokey Bones.
 
"We're pleased with this quarter's operating and financial results, which were once again competitively strong in what remained a challenging industry environment," said Clarence Otis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Darden. "We're also pleased with the strategic progress we made in the quarter, helping build the foundation for future success. Olive Garden's acceleration in new restaurant growth remained on pace, Red Lobster maintained solid momentum with its brand refreshening efforts, Bahama Breeze enjoyed strong margin improvement and Smokey Bones began an in-market test of meaningful changes designed to broaden guest appeal and increase visit frequency. This quarter's results and our strategic progress are due to talented people throughout the Company striving each day to nourish and delight everyone they serve. Because of them, we remain confident that we'll achieve our goal of being the best in casual dining, now and for generations."

Operating Highlights
 
OLIVE GARDEN'S
second quarter sales of $662.1 million were 7.1% above prior year, driven primarily by revenue from 27 net new restaurants opened and a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 2.9%. For the quarter, on a percentage of sales basis, the company's sales gains and lower restaurant expenses partially offset increased food and beverage expenses, restaurant labor expenses, selling, general, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense. As a result, operating profit increased for the quarter
 
RED LOBSTER'S
second quarter sales of $597.0 million were 1.4% above prior year driven primarily by its U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 0.7%. For the quarter, lower food and beverage expenses, restaurant expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of sales, more than offset increased restaurant labor expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. As a result, operating profit increased for the quarter.
 
BAHAMA BREEZE
'
S
second quarter sales of $36.3 million were 0.1% above prior year, due to a same-restaurant sales increase of 0.1%. Despite modest sales growth leverage, the company enjoyed a meaningful increase in operating profit compared to prior year due to continued improvement in operating margins.
 
SMOKEY BONES'
second quarter sales of $81.2 million were 5.0% above prior year, with increased sales from 12 more restaurants in operation offsetting a same-restaurant sales decline of 5.0%.
 
"Despite the challenging environment, we successfully strengthened our business fundamentals, delivered solid operating profit growth and made meaningful progress on the strategic priorities that will drive future success," said Drew Madsen, President and Chief Operating Officer of Darden. "Olive Garden's ability to maintain same-restaurant excellence while accelerating new unit growth speaks to the strength of that brand and their team. Red Lobster achieved modest sales growth, but solid operating profit growth and began implementation of their brand refreshment initiative. Bahama Breeze has improved their guest experience and unit economics sufficiently to restart unit growth. And Smokey Bones began the test of a new direction for the business."
