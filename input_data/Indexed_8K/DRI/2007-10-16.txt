The Company maintains (i) effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances, in all material respects that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
(xxix) NO MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the end of the Company's most recent audited fiscal year, there has been (i) no material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and (ii) except as disclosed in the following sentence, no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. On October 1, 2007, the Company acquired RARE which maintains its own system of internal controls over financial reporting that differs in certain respects from the system of internal controls maintained by the Company. Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, since the end of RARE's most recent audited fiscal year, RARE has not reported that there has been, and the Company has no knowledge that there has been (x) any material weakness in RARE's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) or (y) any change in RARE's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, RARE's internal control over financial reporting; provided, however, that no representation is made that changes in the Company's or RARE's internal controls will not be made in the future as a result of RARE's becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
(xxx) COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. The Company has complied in all respects with all federal, state, local, foreign and similar statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions, judgments and decrees applicable to the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries or to any of the Company's or its Material Subsidiary's properties or assets, or with respect to any of the Company's or its Material Subsidiary's officers, directors, employees or agents in their capacity as such (collectively, "Applicable Laws"), except where the failure to comply would not,
 
Table of Contents
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries has received any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Authority or arbitrator regarding any violation by the Company of, or a failure on the part of the Company to comply with, any Applicable Laws, other than any such violation or failure to comply which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
(xxxi) TAX RETURNS. The Company has filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it in any jurisdiction, and all material Taxes for which the Company is directly or indirectly liable, or to which any of its properties or assets are subject, have been filed other than Taxes being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. There is no material proposed Tax assessment against the Company and, to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for any such assessment, except for contested claims. All references in this subsection 1(a)(xxxi) to the Company shall include any Affiliated Group (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any similar provision of any law), and any partnership or limited liability company in which the Company is a member or partner. "Taxes" means all taxes of any kind or nature, assessments and governmental charges, including interest and penalties (whether or not actually shown on any Tax Return) imposed by any government authority. "Tax Returns" means all reports, returns or other information required to be supplied to a government authority with respect to Taxes.
(xxxii) INSURANCE. Each of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries is insured (including in each case self-insurance and reinsurance) by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts and covering such risks as management reasonably believes are prudent and customary in the businesses in which it is engaged and all such insurance is in full force and effect; neither the Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries has within the last 3 years been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for; and neither the Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries has reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business; except in the case of each of the foregoing as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
(xxxiii) COMPANY NOT AN "INVESTMENT COMPANY." The Company has been advised of the rules and requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering, the sale of the Debt Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, will not be required to register as an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

The Representative, individually and not as representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Debt Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.

This Underwriting Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Section 2(d).

The Company covenants with the Representative and with each Underwriter participating in the offering of Debt Securities, as follows:
(a) REPRESENTATIVE'S REVIEW OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS. During the period beginning on the Applicable Time and ending on the later
 
Table of Contents
of the Closing Time or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), prior to amending or supplementing the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement through incorporation by reference of any report filed under the Exchange Act), the Company shall furnish to the Representative and its counsel for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement, and the Company shall not file or use any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representative or its counsel reasonably objects.
(b) AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS TO THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, PROSPECTUS AND OTHER SECURITIES ACT MATTERS. The Company will comply with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Debt Securities as contemplated in this Underwriting Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. If, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representative or its counsel it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the Representative of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to Section 3(a) and Section 3(d) hereof), file with the Commission (and use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or any new registration statement to be declared or to become effective) and furnish at its own expense to the Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(c) FINAL TERM SHEET. The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Debt Securities, in a form approved by the Representative and attached as EXHIBIT C hereto, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet"). Any such Final Term Sheet is an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus for purposes of this Underwriting Agreement.
 
Table of Contents
(d) PERMITTED FREE WRITING PROSPECTUSES. The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representative, it will not make, any offer relating to the Debt Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representative hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the free writing prospectuses included in EXHIBIT B hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus". The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Debt Securities or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Debt Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 3(c); provided, that each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action without the Company's prior consent that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(e) USE OF PROCEEDS. The Company shall apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Debt Securities sold by it in the manner described under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in each of the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(f) [Intentionally omitted.]

During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Debt Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or

(j) DELIVERY OF PROSPECTUSES. The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities Act.

The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except for format and other variations permitted or required by Regulation S-T.
(k) BLUE SKY QUALIFICATIONS. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Debt Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Debt Securities, up to one year from the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a broker or dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.

Table of Contents
including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(b) INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), such preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any
 
Table of Contents
amendment or supplement thereto).

(c) ACTIONS AGAINST PARTIES; NOTIFICATION. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall have authorized the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by
 
Table of Contents
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) SETTLEMENT WITHOUT CONSENT IF FAILURE TO REIMBURSE. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
SECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Debt Securities pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Debt Securities pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Debt Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of such Debt Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
Table of Contents
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Debt Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Debt Securities set forth opposite their respective names in EXHIBIT A hereto and not joint.
SECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Debt Securities.

SECTION 9. TERMINATION.
(a) TERMINATION. The Representative may terminate this Underwriting Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Underwriting Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) there has occurred, since the Execution Time, any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or there has occurred any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Debt Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Debt Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Company's common stock is listed or quoted, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of such exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by Federal, New York or North Carolina authorities, or (v) there has occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services, or (vi) there is any downgrading in the rating accorded the Debt Securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has placed any of such Debt Securities on what is commonly termed a "watch list" for possible downgrading.
(b) LIABILITIES. If this Underwriting Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 10. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.
If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Debt Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Underwriting Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24 hour period, then:
(a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Debt Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, the non defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under this Underwriting Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non defaulting Underwriters, or
 
Table of Contents
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Debt Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, this Underwriting Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or on the part of the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4 and the indemnification and contribution provisions in Sections 6 and 7 hereof.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Underwriting Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
SECTION 11. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

(2) The aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture shall be limited to $350,000,000 (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered).
(4) The date on which the principal of the Notes is due and payable shall be October 15, 2012.
(5) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.625% per year (based upon a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) (the "Original Interest Rate"), subject to adjustment as described below, from October 16, 2007, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2008, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment, to the Person in whose name such Notes are registered at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 Regular Record Date next preceding the April 15 or October 15 Interest Payment Date. Each April 15 and October 15 shall be an "Interest Payment Date" for the Notes, and the April 1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date shall be the "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
 
The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Notes, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Notes be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or
 
Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Notes following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Notes become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
(6) The interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security shall be payable at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest payable at Maturity on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made against presentation of such Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee. Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security shall be made to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture.
(7) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Notes of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face thereof, all as provided in the Indenture. No Note of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.

The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict and compliance with laws.

"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction, the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the

(Notary Seal)
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of January 1, 1996, (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, an Officers' Certificate of the Company establishing the terms of the Securities of this series pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, limited in aggregate principal amount to $350,000,000. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities of this series (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
 
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Securities of this series, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Securities of this series be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities of this series exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Securities of this series following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Securities of this series shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
The Securities of this series are subject, at the option of the Company, to redemption, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
For purposes of determining the amount at which the Securities of this series may be redeemed, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee receives fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.

The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Paying Agent shall promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each Holder of Securities of this series properly tendered the Change of Control Payment in respect of such Securities of this series, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security of this series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities of this series surrendered. No Securities of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for
 
a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Securities of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating (as defined below) by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities of this series is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade below investment grade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided, that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction, the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Securities of this series and (2)(A) the holders of the Voting Stock (as defined below) of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, members of the Company's Board of Directors who (1) were members of such Board of Directors on the date of the issuance of the Securities of this series or (2) were nominated for election or elected to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors under clause (1) or (2) of this definition who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination or election (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).

"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or any of them, as the case may be.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
 
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and set forth herein, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations (including, if this Security is a Global Security, certain additional limitations) therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

EXHIBIT 4.2
Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of January 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") between Darden Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on September 14, 2007, this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
A. . There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture):
Establishment of Series Pursuant to Section 301 of Indenture
(1) The series of Securities hereby being authorized shall bear the title "6.200% Senior Notes due 2017" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
(2) The aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture shall be limited to $500,000,000 (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered).
(4) The date on which the principal of the Notes is due and payable shall be October 15, 2017.
(5) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 6.200% per year (based upon a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) (the "Original Interest Rate"), subject to adjustment as described below, from October 16, 2007, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2008, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment, to the Person in whose name such Notes are registered at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 Regular Record Date next preceding the April 15 or October 15 Interest Payment Date. Each April 15 and October 15 shall be an "Interest Payment Date" for the Notes, and the April 1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date shall be the "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
 
The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Notes, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Notes be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or
 
Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Notes following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Notes become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
(6) The interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security shall be payable at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest payable at Maturity on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made against presentation of such Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee. Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security shall be made to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture.
(7) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Notes of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face thereof, all as provided in the Indenture. No Note of a principal amount of $2.000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
 
For purposes of determining the amount at which the Notes may be redeemed, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee receives fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York time on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC or its affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors, and (2) three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
(8) The Company shall not be obligated to redeem or purchase any Notes pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has previously exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described in paragraph (7) above, Holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
 
thereof) of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below) but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of Notes describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Notes, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict and compliance with laws.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Paying Agent shall promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment in respect of such Notes, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered. No Note of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
 
requirements for a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating (as defined below) by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade below investment grade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided, that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction, the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the
 
terms of the Notes and (2)(A) the holders of the Voting Stock (as defined below) of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.

State of
                    
(Notary Seal)
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of January 1, 1996, (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, an Officers' Certificate of the Company establishing the terms of the Securities of this series pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities of this series (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
 
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Securities of this series, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Securities of this series be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities of this series exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Securities of this series following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Securities of this series shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
The Securities of this series are subject, at the option of the Company, to redemption, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 25 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
For purposes of determining the amount at which the Securities of this series may be redeemed, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee receives fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York time on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC or its affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors, and (2) three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. No Security of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has previously exercised its right to redeem the Securities of this series as described above, Holders of the Securities of this series may require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the
 
Securities of this series pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities of this series repurchased, to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities of this series on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of such conflict and compliance with laws.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Paying Agent shall promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each Holder of Securities of this series properly tendered the Change of Control Payment in respect of such Securities of this series, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security of this series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities of this series surrendered. No Securities of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for
 
a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
For purposes of determining the circumstances under which the Company shall be required to repurchase Securities of this series at the option of Holders upon a Change of Control, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Securities of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating (as defined below) by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities of this series is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade below investment grade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided, that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction, the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Securities of this series and (2)(A) the holders of the Voting Stock (as defined below) of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.

"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P and Fitch (or, in each case, if such rating agency ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons considered outside of the Company's control, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any rating agency selected by the Company as a replacement rating agency as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agencies" below).
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or any of them, as the case may be.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
 
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and set forth herein, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations (including, if this Security is a Global Security, certain additional limitations) therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

EXHIBIT 4.3
Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of January 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") between Darden Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on September 14, 2007, this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.
A. . There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture):
Establishment of Series Pursuant to Section 301 of Indenture
(1) The series of Securities hereby being authorized shall bear the title "6.800% Senior Notes due 2037" (referred to herein as the "Notes").
(2) The aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture shall be limited to $300,000,000 (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered).
(4) The date on which the principal of the Notes is due and payable shall be October 15, 2037.
(5) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 6.800% per year (based upon a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) (the "Original Interest Rate"), subject to adjustment as described below, from October 16, 2007, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2008, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment, to the Person in whose name such Notes are registered at the close of business on the April 1 or October 1 Regular Record Date next preceding the April 15 or October 15 Interest Payment Date. Each April 15 and October 15 shall be an "Interest Payment Date" for the Notes, and the April 1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding an Interest Payment Date shall be the "Regular Record Date" for the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.
 
The interest rate payable on the Notes shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Notes shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Notes, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Notes be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Notes exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Notes shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Notes shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or
 
Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Notes following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Notes shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Notes become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
(6) The interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security shall be payable at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest payable at Maturity on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made against presentation of such Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee. Payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security shall be made to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture.
(7) The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 35 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Notes of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face thereof, all as provided in the Indenture.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and official seal, in the state and county aforesaid.
 
(Notary Seal)
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of January 1, 1996, (herein called the "Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, an Officers' Certificate of the Company establishing the terms of the Securities of this series pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated above, limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount.
The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series shall be subject to adjustment from time to time if any of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), or Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities of this series (a "rating"). If the rating from any one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
 
If more than one of Moody's, S&P or Fitch decreases its rating to a rating set forth in the table above, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be increased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the decrease.
If any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently increases its rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall be decreased such that the interest rate equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P or Fitch in effect immediately following the increase.
 
In determining the increase or decrease, if any, in the interest rate on the Securities of this series, the percentage applicable to the lowest two ratings levels of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used. Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the interest rate on the Securities of this series be reduced below the Original Interest Rate and (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities of this series exceed 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceases to provide a rating, any subsequent reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall result in an interest rate equal to the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above.
No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating. If all of Moody's, S&P and Fitch cease to provide a rating, the interest rate on the Securities of this series shall increase to or remain at, as the case may be, 2.000% above the Original Interest Rate, until any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provides a rating. The interest rate on the Securities of this series following such subsequent rating shall be the Original Interest Rate plus twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above unless and until two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch subsequently provide a rating.
The interest rate on the Securities of this series shall permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all three rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A2/A/A or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies (or one of these ratings if only rated by one rating agency).
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above shall be determined by the Company and shall take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate. The Company shall provide written notice of any such adjustment to the Trustee on the last day of the applicable interest period. If the interest rate adjusts more than once during the same interest period, the interest rate for such interest period shall be determined based on the ratings in effect at the end of the second Business Day prior to the end of such interest period.
The Securities of this series are subject, at the option of the Company, to redemption, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, prior to the Stated Maturity upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 35 basis points plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities to the Redemption Date, but interest installments whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.
 
For purposes of determining the amount at which the Securities of this series may be redeemed, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:

"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities of this series.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee receives fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York time on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC or its affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors, and (2) three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. No Security of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has previously exercised its right to redeem the Securities of this series as described above, Holders of the Securities of this series may require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the
 
Securities of this series pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities of this series repurchased, to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities of this series on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures described in such notice. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of such conflict and compliance with laws.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Paying Agent shall promptly pay, from funds deposited by the Company for such purpose, to each Holder of Securities of this series properly tendered the Change of Control Payment in respect of such Securities of this series, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security of this series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities of this series surrendered. No Securities of this series of a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be repurchased in part.
The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for
 
a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company shall not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
For purposes of determining the circumstances under which the Company shall be required to repurchase Securities of this series at the option of Holders upon a Change of Control, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth next to each of them below:
"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Securities of this series are rated below an Investment Grade Rating (as defined below) by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which 60-day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities of this series is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade below investment grade by any of the Rating Agencies); provided, that a Below Investment Grade Rating Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Rating Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Triggering Event) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Rating Event).
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Company's Voting Stock measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (1) pursuant to such transaction, the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company that has agreed to be bound by the terms of the Securities of this series and (2)(A) the holders of the Voting Stock (as defined below) of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.
"Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, members of the Company's Board of Directors who (1) were members of such Board of Directors on the date of the issuance of the Securities of this series or (2) were nominated for election or elected to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors under clause (1) or (2) of this definition who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination or election (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment Grade Rating" means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P and Fitch (or, in each case, if such rating agency ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons considered outside of the Company's control, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any rating agency selected by the Company as a replacement rating agency as set forth in the definition of "Rating Agencies" below).
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
"Rating Agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of the Securities of this series publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or any of them, as the case may be.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting Stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
 
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth and set forth herein, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations (including, if this Security is a Global Security, certain additional limitations) therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription above, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations.
