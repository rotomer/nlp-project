FOR RELEASE
January 21, 2009
4:30 PM ET
ORLANDO, FL, January 21  Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE: DRI) will webcast its 2009 Analyst and Investor Meeting on January 22 and 23, 2009. During the meeting, the Company will present financial information, a detailed update for each of the brands and the Company's outlook regarding the full-service restaurant industry. In addition, the Company will reaffirm its fiscal year 2009 sales and diluted net earnings per share guidance provided in December 2008. At that time, the Company stated that it expected combined U.S. same-restaurant sales declines in fiscal 2009 of approximately -1.25% to -2.25% for Red Lobster, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse (which reflects anticipated declines of approximately - -2% to -4% in the second half of the fiscal year), and that it expected to open approximately 70 net new restaurants in fiscal 2009. As a result, the Company expects total sales growth of between 8% and 9% in fiscal 2009, compared to reported sales from continuing operations of $6.63 billion in fiscal 2008. This total sales growth includes the approximate two percentage point impact of a 53rd week in fiscal 2009; excluding the 53rd week, the expected total sales growth would be approximately 6% to 7%.
In December 2008, the Company also stated that it anticipates reported diluted net earnings per share declines from continuing operations of -1% to -6% in fiscal 2009, which includes the impact of the 53
rd
week. This compares to reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.55 in fiscal 2008. The additional week is expected to contribute approximately two percentage points, or $0.06 per diluted share, of growth in fiscal 2009. Excluding the estimated integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments of approximately 19 cents in fiscal 2008, net earnings from continuing operations were $2.74 per diluted share. In fiscal 2009, these costs and adjustments are estimated to be approximately eight cents per diluted share. Excluding the impact of these costs and adjustments for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, the Company expects diluted net earnings per share declines of -5% to -10% on a 53-week basis.
On Thursday, January 22, the webcast will begin at 3:00 p.m. ET and end at 5:00 p.m. ET. Please go to to access Thursday's webcast.
