against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
23
(ii)
    
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representatives), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;
provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(b)
    
INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, and employees, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), such preliminary prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). The Company hereby acknowledges that the only information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the following locations under the caption Underwriting in the preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus: (i) the information in the first two sentences in the second paragraph after the table showing the principal amount of Notes being purchased by each Underwriter (the Allocation Table), (ii) the information in the third sentence in the sixth paragraph after the

(c)
    
ACTIONS AGAINST PARTIES; NOTIFICATION. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall have authorized the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
25
(d)
    
SETTLEMENT WITHOUT CONSENT IF FAILURE TO REIMBURSE. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (i) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (ii) provides written notice to the indemnified party substantiating the unpaid balance as unreasonable, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
SECTION 7.
    
CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of such Notes as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
26
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Exhibit A hereto and not joint.
SECTION 8.
    
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Notes.
SECTION 9.
    
TERMINATION.
(a)
    
TERMINATION. The Representatives may terminate this Underwriting Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, if (i) there has been, since the Execution Time or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) there has occurred, since the Execution Time, any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity
27
or crisis or there has occurred any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Notes, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Companys common stock is listed or quoted, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of such exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, FINRA or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by Federal, New York or North Carolina authorities, or (v) there has occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services, or (vi) there is any downgrading in the rating accorded the Notes by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has placed any of such Notes on what is commonly termed a watch list for possible downgrading.
(b)
    
LIABILITIES. If this Underwriting Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8 and 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
SECTION 10.
    
DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS.
If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Underwriting Agreement (the Defaulted Securities), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24 hour period, then:
(a)    if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Notes to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under this Underwriting Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b)    if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Notes to be purchased on such date pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, this Underwriting Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or on
28
the part of the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4 and the indemnification and contribution provisions in Sections 6 and 7 hereof.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Underwriting Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
SECTION 11.

EXHIBIT D-1
FORM OF OPINION OF HUNTON & WILLIAMS LLP, COUNSEL FOR
THE COMPANY, TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(b)
(1)    The Company is a validly formed and existing corporation and is in good standing under the laws of the state of Florida.
(2)    The Company has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement.
(3)    The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(4)    The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company, and assuming due authentication by the Trustee in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivery against payment of the consideration therefor by the Underwriters as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid, legal and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or general principles of equity, whether considered at law or in equity.
(5)    The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee) constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or general principles of equity, whether considered at law or in equity.
(6)    The Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.
(7)    The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions Description of Notes and Description of Debt Securities insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the documents referred to therein are correct in all material respects and fairly present the information required by the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act.
(8)    The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations, insofar as such statements constitute matters of federal law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, have been reviewed by such counsel and are correct in all material respects.
D-1
(9)    The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture (including the Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order establishing certain terms of the Notes) and the Notes and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement, including the issuance and sale of the Notes, do not and will not (a) violate any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, (b) violate any law of the State of New York or any federal law of the United States or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any judgment, decree or order binding on the Company or its properties that is known to such counsel, or any of the provisions of any indenture, deed of trust, contract or other instrument to which the Company is a party identified in the Registration Statement or incorporated therein by reference, or (c) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, deed of trust, contract or other instrument.
(10)    The Registration Statement is an automatic shelf registration statement as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act that became effective upon filing with the Commission under the Securities Act. Any required filing of any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) and any required filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 have been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rules 424(b) and 433, as applicable. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities Act and, to the best of such counsels knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Securities Act.
(11)    No consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental authority is required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and such as may be required under the state securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution by the Underwriters of the Notes.
In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. In rendering the opinion in paragraph 1 with respect to good standing, such counsel may rely solely upon a certificate from the Secretary of State of the State of Florida. In rendering the opinion in the third sentence of paragraph 10, such counsel may rely solely upon a telephone conversation with a member of the staff of the Commission. Such opinions shall not state that they are to be governed or qualified by, or that they are otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).
* * * * *
Part II
In addition, such counsel shall state that they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accountants for the Company and representatives of the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and any supplements or
D-2
amendments thereto, and related matters were discussed and reviewed. Because of the inherent limitations in the independent verification of factual matters, and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of disclosure documents, such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto (other than as specified above).
(1)    Subject to and on the basis of the foregoing, such counsel advises that nothing has come to their attention in the course of such discussions and reviews that would cause such counsel to believe that:
(i)     the Registration Statement, at each time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading;
(ii)     the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or
(iii)        the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(2)    Each of the Registration Statement, when it became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, appears on its face to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable instructions, rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents of a character which are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or are required to be summarized therein and are not so filed or summarized.
(3)    The documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, at the times they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and the applicable instructions, rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
With respect to paragraphs (1) through (3) above, it being understood that such counsel need express no belief as to the Form T-1 or the financial statements or schedules or other financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or any amendments or supplements thereto.

EXHIBIT D-2
FORM OF OPINION OF DOUGLAS E. WENTZ, SENIOR ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY, TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(b)

(3)    The Material Subsidiaries have the corporate power and authority, to own, lease and operate their properties and to conduct their business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(4)    The information in the Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters, the Companys charter and bylaws or legal proceedings or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by me and is correct in all material respects.
(5)    The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture (including the Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order establishing certain terms of the Notes), and the Notes and the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein and in the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Notes and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes as described under the caption Use of Proceeds) and compliance by the Company with its obligations thereunder do not and will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Material Subsidiaries pursuant to any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to such counsel, to which the Material Subsidiaries are a party or by which any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Material Subsidiaries is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults, events or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by laws of any Material Subsidiaries or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to such counsel, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Material Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations.
(6)    There is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to which the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries thereof is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries thereof is subject, before or by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or which might
D-2-1
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
(7)    To the best of such counsels knowledge, there are no contracts or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto.
In rendering such opinions, counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent it deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Such opinions shall not state that they are to be governed or qualified by, or that they are otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991).

Investment Grade Rating means a rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moodys and equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by

S&P means Standard & Poors Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

The Notes are to be issued pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated October 1, 2012 (the Underwriting Agreement)
among the Company and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., as representatives of the Underwriters,
and as
described in the prospectus dated October 6, 2010, contained in the Registration Statement filed with the Commission, and the prospectus supplement, dated October 1, 2012, filed with the Commission on October 2, 2012 (the Prospectus).
 
We have examined originals or reproductions or certified copies of certain corporate records of the Company, and certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering this opinion, including:
For purposes of the opinions expressed below, we have assumed without independent investigation (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents, (iii) the genuineness of all signatures not witnessed by us, (iv) the legal capacity of all natural persons, and (v) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents by all parties and the validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof (other than the authorization, execution and delivery of documents by the Company and the validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof upon the Company).
We do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than the laws of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States of America. We note that as to matters of Florida law, you have received an opinion, dated the date hereof, of Douglas E. Wentz, Esq., your Senior Associate General Counsel, which is also filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
Based solely upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized by the Company, and when executed and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid, legal and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or general principles of equity, whether considered at law or in equity.
  
      This opinion is being furnished to you for submission to the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on or about the date hereof (the Current Report), which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
