Exhibit 99 Feb. 28, 2003 DTE ENERGY ANNOUNCES COMPLETION OF SALE OF TRANSMISSION BUSINESS DETROIT - DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today announced it has completed the sale of its transmission business subsidiary, International Transmission Co. (ITC), to an investor group including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and Trimaran Capital Partners L.L.C. for approximately $610 million cash. The closing follows last week's approval of the transaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The approval marked one of the final regulatory steps in the divestiture process. "We're pleased the sale has closed," said Anthony F. Earley Jr., DTE Energy chairman and CEO. "The sale of ITC is consistent with our corporate strategy and with FERC's policy to promote an independent transmission grid. Michigan will now be the first state to have virtually all electric utility customers served by a completely independent electric transmission system. "The sale of ITC also demonstrates DTE Energy's continued commitment to restructuring the electric industry in Michigan and to further strengthen the company's balance sheet," Earley added. The transaction includes ITC's and its parent, DTE Energy's, system of 3,000 miles of high voltage electric transmission lines and associated facilities and easements.
