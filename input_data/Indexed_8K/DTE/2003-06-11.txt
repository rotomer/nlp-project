Item 5. Other Events
     Speaking at the Deutsche Bank 8th Annual Electric Power Conference in New York this morning, DTE Energy Company Chairman, President, CEO and COO, Anthony F. Earley, Jr., provided an update on several aspects of the Company's largest non-regulated business segment focused on synthetic fuel production and sales. DTE Energy Company ("DTE Energy") operates nine synthetic fuel production facilities, seven of which are wholly-owned. Synthetic fuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rules. The production and sale of synthetic fuel produced at these facilities generates federal income tax credits under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. As previously disclosed in its 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, DTE Energy, through its subsidiaries, received favorable private letter rulings ("PLRs") from the IRS on 7 of its 9 synthetic fuel plants.
The following items are matters relating to the synthetic fuel plants covered by Mr. Earley during his speech:
