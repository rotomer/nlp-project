EXHIBIT 99.1 Aug. 14, 2003 DTE ENERGY RECONFIRMS 2003 OPERATING EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOLLOWING MODIFICATION TO SECOND QUARTER ANNOUNCED EARNINGS DETROIT -- DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) today will file its second quarter 2003 Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company will report a loss for the quarter of $39 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. This includes an additional $16 million negative earnings impact not reflected in the unaudited loss of $23 million, or $0.13 per diluted share that was announced July 28, 2003. The earnings revision was due to a change in the interpretation of insurance coverage for an April ice storm. The revision does not change the company's 2003 operating earnings guidance. Reported earnings for the second quarter 2002 were $68 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Revised operating earnings for the quarter were $70 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to operating earnings of $86 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the same period in 2002. Reported earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $116 million, or $0.69 per share versus $268 million or $1.66 per share in 2002. Year-to-date operating earnings were $248 million, or $1.47 per share, compared to $267 million, or $1.65 per share in 2002. An updated income statement for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2003 is at the end of this release, as well as an updated balance sheet as of June 30, 2003. After experiencing back-to-back catastrophic storms in April and July, the company initiated a review of its storm-related insurance portfolio. The April storm, occurring in the second quarter, had a pre-insurance cost of $50 million and the July storm, in the third quarter, had a pre-insurance cost of $20 million. The recently completed review recognized that the insurance coverage and the level of risk retained by the company for the second quarter and third quarter storms were different than previously understood. The level of risk retained and the after-insurance cost of the April storm was higher than previously understood, and the level of risk retained for the July storm was lower. The company determined that it is appropriate to increase operating expenses in the second quarter to reflect that less of the April storm was covered by insurance than had been previously determined and recorded, even though this adjustment is small. The third quarter storm is substantially covered by insurance. Therefore, the revision of second quarter earnings results does not impact the company's 2003 operating earnings guidance, which it reaffirmed at $3.10 - $3.30 per share. This guidance assumes no additional storm expense through year-end. A reconciliation of reported to operating earnings per share for both the quarter ended and six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 are at the end of this release. DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings power from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the DTE Energy Board of Directors. 1
