Indentures
     The Detroit Edison Company ("Detroit Edison") and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture dated February 1, 2005 in connection with the issuance by Detroit Edison on February 7, 2005 of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2005 Series A 4.80% Senior Notes due 2015 and $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2005 Series B 5.45% Senior Notes due 2035 (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") or under the securities laws of any jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and may only be sold in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
     Interest accrues on the 2005 Series A notes and 2005 Series B notes at 4.80% and 5.45% per annum, respectively. Interest on each series of Notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning August 15, 2005. Each series of Notes may be redeemed at Detroit Edison's option, in whole or in part, at any time. The redemption price for each series will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed plus 15 basis points in the case of Series A notes and 20 basis points in the case of Series B notes plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Notes are secured by corresponding series of Detroit Edison's general and refunding mortgage bonds 2005 Series A and 2005 Series B (collectively, the "Bonds"). The Bonds were issued pursuant to a supplemental indenture between Detroit Edison and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee, dated February 1, 2005.
     
Registration Rights Agreement
     Detroit Edison entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated February 7, 2005 with the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Registration Rights Agreement requires Detroit Edison to file and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a registration statement to permit holders to exchange the Notes for new notes that are registered under the Securities Act. The new notes will have identical terms to the Notes, except that the new notes will not have restrictions on transfer or bear additional interest. If Detroit Edison cannot complete the exchange offer by October 5, 2005, and under certain other conditions, Detroit Edison is required to file and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective by the SEC a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Notes. If Detroit Edison is not able to complete the exchange offer or have the shelf registration statement declared effective within a certain period of time, and under certain other conditions, Detroit Edison is required to pay additional interest on the Notes.
     The Supplemental Indentures and the Registration Rights Agreement are filed as exhibits to this Current Report, and the description of each document above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indentures and the Registration Rights Agreement.

For purposes of the Original Indenture, each series of the Notes shall separately constitute a single series of Securities. The Stated Maturity on which the principal of the 4.80% Notes shall be due and payable will be February 15, 2015. The Stated Maturity on which the principal of the 5.80% Notes shall be due and payable will be February 15, 2035. The Securities issued on the date hereof will be (a) offered and sold by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and (b) resold initially only to (i) QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (such resold Securities to be referred to herein as the "Rule 144A Securities") and (ii) Persons other than U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S (such resold Securities to be referred to herein as the "Regulation S Securities" and, together with the Rule 144A Securities, the "Transfer Restricted Securities"). Such Transfer Restricted Securities may thereafter be transferred to, among others, QIBs and purchasers in reliance on Regulation S. SECTION 2.02. Certain Variations from the Original Indenture. (a) The Notes shall have the benefit of the provisions of Article Four of the Original Indenture and shall have the benefit of, or be subject to, the other related provisions of the Original Indenture relating to the grant of security, including (for avoidance of doubt and not for purposes of limitation) the Granting Clause, the definitions of "Deliverable Mortgage Bonds," "Deliverable Securities," "Designated Mortgage Bonds," "Grant," "Mortgage," "Mortgage Bonds," "Mortgage Trustee," "Previously Delivered Mortgage Bonds," and "Trust Estate," Section 301 (20), Sections 301 (a) (v), (ix), (x) and (xi), Sections 301 (b) (ii) and (iii), Section 301 (d), and Sections 601(4) and (8), subject, in each case, to the release provisions provided for in Section 4.02 herein. In addition, on and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, the Notes shall have the benefit of the additional covenants set forth in Article Three hereof. (b) Section 503 of the Original Indenture shall apply to the Notes. The following shall be an additional condition to defeasance of the Notes under Section 503: the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from the Internal Revenue Service a letter ruling, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service a Revenue Ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, the Holders of such Outstanding Notes appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to 6
U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred, and, also, to the effect that, after the 123rd day after the date of deposit, all money and other property as provided pursuant to Section 503 of the Original Indenture (including the proceeds thereof) deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) pursuant to Section 503 of the Original Indenture to be held in trust will not be subject to any case or proceeding (whether voluntary or involuntary) in respect of the Company under any Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law, or any decree or order for relief in respect of the Company issued in connection therewith. SECTION 2.03. Amount and Denominations; DTC. (a) The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture is limited initially to $200,000,000 (in the case of the 4.80% Notes), and $200,000,000 (in the case of the 5.45% Notes) (except, in each case, as provided in Section 301(2) of the Original Indenture); provided that the Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Outstanding Notes of any series, "reopen" each series of the Notes so as to increase the aggregate principal amount of such Notes Outstanding in compliance with the procedures set forth in the Original Indenture, including Section 301 and Section 303 thereof, so long as any such additional Notes have the same terms, conditions and CUSIP number (including, without limitation, rights to security and to receive accrued and unpaid interest) as the Notes of such series then Outstanding. No additional Notes of a series may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to that series. The Notes shall be issuable only in fully registered form and, as permitted by Section 301 and Section 302 of the Original Indenture, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. The Notes will initially be issued in global form (the "Global Securities") under a book-entry system, registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, as depositary ("DTC"), or its nominee, which is hereby designated as "Depositary" under the Indenture. (b) If (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Securities or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and, in either such case, the Company does not appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days thereafter, or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default or an event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, certificates for the Notes will be registered and delivered to the Holders of record. Upon receipt of a withdrawal request from the Company, the Depositary will notify its participants of the receipt of a withdrawal request from the Company, notifying participants that they may utilize the Depositary's withdrawal procedures if they wish to withdraw their securities from the Depositary. To the extent that the book-entry system is discontinued or, if the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary, certificates for the Notes will be registered and delivered to the Holders of record. 7
SECTION 2.04. Transfer and Exchange. (a) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Securities. When Registered Securities are presented to the Security Registrar with a request: (i) to register the transfer of such Registered Securities; or (ii) to exchange such Registered Securities for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations of the same aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity, the Security Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Registered Securities surrendered for transfer or exchange: (A) shall be duly endorsed or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing; and (B) are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (x) if such Registered Securities are being delivered to the Security Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Transfer Restricted Security); or (y) if such Registered Securities are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Transfer Restricted Security); or (C) if such Registered Securities are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or in reliance upon another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, (i) a certification to that effect (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Transfer Restricted Security) and (ii) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section 2.04(e)(i). In case of redemption, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so 8
selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. (b) Restrictions on Transfer of a Definitive Security for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security. A Registered Security may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Registered Security, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, together with: (i) certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Transfer Restricted Security) that such Registered Security is being transferred (A) to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A or (B) outside the United States in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S and in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act; and (ii) written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Securities custodian to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such increase, then the Trustee shall cancel such Registered Security and cause, or direct the Securities custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Securities represented by the Global Security to be increased by the aggregate principal amount of the Registered Security to be exchanged and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security so canceled. If no Global Securities are then outstanding and the Global Security has not been previously exchanged for certificated securities pursuant to Section 2.03(b), the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Security in the appropriate principal amount. (c) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities. (i) The transfer and exchange of Global Securities or beneficial interests herein shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depositary therefor. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a Global Security shall deliver a written order given in accordance with the Depositary's procedures containing information regarding the participant account of the Depositary to be credited with a beneficial interest in such Global Security or another Global Security and such account shall be credited in accordance with such order with a beneficial interest in the applicable Global Security and the account of the Person making the 9
transfer shall be debited by an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Security being transferred. Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in a Rule 144A Global Security to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through a Regulation S Global Security, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period, shall be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a certification (in the form set forth on the reverse side of the Transfer Restricted Security) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or (if available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act and that, if such transfer is being made prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred shall be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. (ii) If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest in one Global Security to a beneficial interest in another Global Security, the Security Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Security to which such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Security Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the principal amount of Global Security from which such interest is being transferred. (iii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture (other than the provisions set forth in Section 2.03), a Global Security may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. (iv) In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for Registered Securities pursuant to Section 2.03(b) prior to the effectiveness of a Registration Statement with respect to such Securities, such Securities may be exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.04 (including the certification requirements set forth on the reverse of the Transfer Restricted Security intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may from time to time be adopted by the Company. (d) Restrictions on Transfer of Regulation S Global Security. (i) Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, interests in a Regulation S Global Security may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. During the Restricted Period, beneficial ownership interests in a Regulation S Global Security may only be sold, pledged or transferred through Euroclear or Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures and only (A) to the Company, (B) so long as such security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom 10
notice is given that the resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (C) in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (D) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under the Securities Act, or (E) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Security to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through a Rule 144A Global Security shall be made only in accordance with the applicable procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form provided on the reverse of the Transfer Restricted Security to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Such written certification shall no longer be required after the expiration of the Restricted Period. (ii) Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial ownership interests in a Regulation S Global Security shall be transferable in accordance with applicable law and the other terms of the Indenture. (e) Legends for Securities. (i) Except as permitted by the following paragraphs (ii), (iii), or (iv), each Security certificate evidencing the Global Securities and the Registered Securities (and all Securities issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (each defined term in the legend being defined as such for purposes of the legend only): THE NOTES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (A)(1) TO A PERSON WHO THE SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PURCHASING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (2) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION COMPLYING WITH RULE 903 OR RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (3) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER (IF AVAILABLE), (4) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT, (5) TO THE DETROIT EDISON COMPANY OR (6) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND (B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE STATES OF THE UNITED STATES. 11

Each Registered Security shall bear the following additional legend: IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER, THE HOLDER WILL DELIVER TO THE REGISTRAR AND TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATES AND OTHER INFORMATION AS SUCH TRANSFER AGENT MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT THE TRANSFER COMPLIES WITH THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS.

(iii) After a transfer of any Transfer Restricted Securities during the period of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement with respect to such Transfer Restricted Securities, as the case may be, all requirements pertaining to the Restricted Securities Legend on such Transfer Restricted Securities shall cease to apply and the requirements that any such Transfer Restricted Securities be issued in global form shall continue to apply. (iv) Upon a sale or transfer after the expiration of the Restricted Period of any Transfer Restricted Security acquired pursuant to Regulation S, all requirements that such 12
Transfer Restricted Security bear the Restricted Securities Legend shall cease to apply and the requirements that any such Transfer Restricted Security be issued in global form shall continue to apply. SECTION 2.05. Certain Terms of the Notes. (a) The 4.80% Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 4.80% per annum and the 5.45% Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 5.45% per annum on the respective principal amount thereof from the date of original issuance, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal of such series of Notes becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum during such overdue period. The Notes shall bear additional interest ("Additional Interest") pursuant to the Registration Agreement upon the occurrence of any Registration Default (as defined therein). Additional Interest shall be payable on the applicable Interest Payment Date to the same persons and in the same manner as provided for herein for payment of ordinary interest. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing August 15, 2005. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months. (b) In the event that any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or other date of Maturity of the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the amount payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date with respect to any Note will, as provided in the Original Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in the Original Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the relevant record date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (the "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of the applicable Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture. The principal of, and premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal 13
tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are Global Securities and are held in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depositary, payments on the Notes will be made to the Depositary or its nominee in accordance with arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and the Depositary. (c) The Notes are not subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof and are not subject to any sinking fund. As provided in the forms of Notes attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, the Notes are subject to optional redemption, as a whole or in part, by the Company prior to Stated Maturity of the principal thereof on the terms set forth therein. Except as modified in the forms of Notes, redemptions shall be effected in accordance with Article Twelve of the Original Indenture. (d) The Notes shall have such other terms and provisions as are set forth in the forms of Notes attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, as applicable (each of which are incorporated by reference in and made a part of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture as if set forth in full at this place). SECTION 2.06. Forms of Notes. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the form of the definitive 4.80% Note. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the form of the definitive 5.45% Note. If the Company elects to have the Notes secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds on and after the Release Date, the terms of such Notes shall be amended to make appropriate reference to the Substitute Mortgage and the Substitute Mortgage Bonds; provided, that the consent of Holders shall not be required in connection with such amendment. ARTICLE THREE ADDITIONAL COVENANTS SECTION 3.01. Limitations on Liens. (a) From and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company may not issue, assume, guarantee (including any contingent obligation to purchase) or permit to exist any Debt that is secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge or lien ("Lien") of or upon any Operating Property owned by the Company, whether owned at the Release Date or subsequently acquired, without effectively securing the Notes (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of the Company ranking equally with the Notes) equally and ratably with the Debt (but only so long as the Debt is so secured). The foregoing restriction will not apply to: (i) Liens on any Operating Property existing at the time of its acquisition and not created in contemplation of the acquisition; 14
(ii) Liens on Operating Property of a corporation existing at the time the corporation is merged into or consolidated with the Company, or at the time the corporation disposes of substantially all of its properties (or those of a division) to the Company, provided that the Lien is not extended to property owned by the Company immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or other disposition and is not created in contemplation of the merger, consolidation or other disposition; (iii) Liens on Operating Property to secure the cost of acquisition, construction, development or substantial repair, alteration or improvement of such property or to secure indebtedness incurred to provide funds for any of these purposes or for reimbursement of funds previously expended for any of these purposes, provided the Liens are created or assumed contemporaneously with, or within 18 months after, the acquisition or the completion of substantial repair or alteration, construction, development or substantial improvement or within 6 months thereafter pursuant to a commitment for financing arranged with a lender or investor within such 18-month period; (iv) Liens in favor of the United States or any state or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States or any state, or for the benefit of holders of securities issued by any of these entities, to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of substantially repairing or altering, constructing, developing or substantially improving the Operating Property; or (v) Any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in the exceptions listed above, provided, however, that the principal amount of Debt secured thereby and not otherwise authorized by those exceptions listed above shall not exceed the principal amount of Debt, plus any premium or fee payable in connection with any such extension, renewal or replacement, so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, the Company may issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions up to an aggregate amount which, together with all other of the Company's secured Debt (not including secured Debt permitted under any of the foregoing exceptions) and the Value of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions existing at such time (other than Sale and Lease-Back Transactions the proceeds of which have been applied to the retirement of certain indebtedness, Sale and Lease-Back Transactions in which the property involved would have been permitted to be subjected to a Lien under any of the foregoing exceptions, and Sale and Lease-Back Transactions that are permitted by the first sentence of Section 3.02 below), does not exceed the greater of 10% of the Company's Net Tangible Assets or 10% of the Company's Capitalization. The foregoing 15
restrictions do not limit the Company's ability to place Liens on (i) the capital stock of any of the Company's subsidiaries or (ii) the assets of any of the Company's subsidiaries. SECTION 3.02. Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. So long as the Notes are outstanding from and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, the Company may not enter into or permit to exist any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction with respect to any Operating Property (except for leases for a term, including any renewal or potential renewal, of not more than 48 months), if the purchaser's commitment is obtained more than 18 months after the later of the completion of the acquisition, construction or development of the Operating Property or the placing in operation of the Operating Property or of the Operating Property as constructed or developed or substantially repaired, altered or improved. This restriction will not apply if (a) the Company would be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) above to issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist Debt secured by a Lien on the Operating Property without equally and ratably securing the Notes, (b) after giving effect to the Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, pursuant to Section 3.01(b) above, the Company could incur, at least $1.00 of additional Debt secured by Liens (other than Liens permitted by clause (a)), or (c) the Company applies within 180 days an amount equal to, in the case of a sale or transfer for cash, the net proceeds (not less than the fair value of the Operating Property so leased), and, otherwise, an amount equal to the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the Operating Property so leased to the retirement of Notes or other Debt of the Company ranking equally with the Notes; provided, however, that any such retirement of Notes shall be in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture and the Notes; provided, further, that the amount to be applied to such retirement of Notes or other Debt shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (a) an amount equal to the redemption price with respect to Notes delivered within such one hundred eighty (180)-day period to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation and (b) the principal amount, plus any premium or fee paid in connection with any redemption in accordance with the terms of other Debt voluntarily retired by the Company within such one hundred eighty (180)-day period, excluding in each case retirements pursuant to mandatory sinking fund or prepayment provisions and payments at Stated Maturity. SECTION 3.03. Waiver. Section 1109 of the Original Indenture shall apply to the covenants set forth in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 above at any time such covenants are in effect. ARTICLE FOUR SECURITY AND RELEASE PROVISIONS SECTION 4.01. Security. Subject to Section 4.02 below, as provided in and pursuant to Article Four of the Original Indenture, each series of the Notes will be secured as to payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, by a series of Mortgage Bonds (the "General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 2005 Series A", in the case of the 4.80% 16
Notes, and the "General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 2005 Series B", in the case of the 5.45% Notes, or singly or collectively, the "Bonds", the "Bonds of the related series" or the "related series of Bonds") of the Company to be issued concurrently with the issuance of the Notes under and secured by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of October 1, 1924, between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, including the supplemental indenture, dated as of February 1, 2005, creating the Bonds (collectively, the "Mortgage"), pledged by the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the respective series of Notes to the Trustee under this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture. The Bonds of each series shall be issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the related series of the Notes. SECTION 4.02. Release. Until the Release Date and subject to Article Four of the Original Indenture, the Bonds of the related series issued and delivered to the Trustee shall serve as security for any and all obligations of the Company under all Notes of the applicable series from time to time Outstanding, including, but not limited to (1) the full and prompt payment of the principal and premium, if any, on such Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture or such Notes, either at the Stated Maturity thereof, upon acceleration of the maturity thereof, upon redemption, or otherwise, and (2) the full and prompt payment of any interest on such Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Indenture or such Notes including, if and to the extent provided for in such Notes, interest on overdue installments of principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest on overdue installments of interest. Each supplemental indenture to the Mortgage pursuant to which any Bonds are issued shall contain a provision to the effect that any payment by the Company hereunder of principal of or premium or interest on Notes which shall have been authenticated and delivered in connection with the issuance and delivery to the Trustee of such Bonds (other than by the application of the proceeds of a payment in respect of such Bonds) shall to the extent thereof, be deemed to satisfy and discharge the obligation of the Company, if any, to make a payment of principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, in respect of such Bonds which is then due. Notwithstanding anything in the Original Indenture to the contrary, from and after the Release Date, the obligation of the Company to make payment with respect to the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall be deemed satisfied and discharged as provided in the supplemental indenture or indentures to the Mortgage creating such Bonds and the Bonds shall cease to secure in any manner Notes theretofore or subsequently issued; the Trustee shall thereupon surrender the Bonds to the Mortgage Trustee for cancellation and execute and deliver such proper instruments of release as may be required. From and after the Release Date, all Notes, whether theretofore or subsequently issued, shall, at the Company's option, either (i) become unsecured or (ii) be secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds pursuant to Section 4.03 below, and any 17
conditions to the issuance of Notes that refer or relate to Bonds or the Mortgage shall be inapplicable (except as such conditions shall be deemed to refer to Substitute Mortgage Bonds or a Substitute Mortgage pursuant to Section 4.03 below). From and after the Release Date, the Company shall not issue any additional Mortgage Bonds, including Pledged Bonds, under the Mortgage. Notice of the occurrence of the Release Date shall be given by the Trustee to the Holders of the Notes in the manner provided for in the Original Indenture not later than 30 days after the Company notifies the Trustee of the occurrence of the Release Date. In connection with the establishment of the occurrence of the Release Date, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, may presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate designating the Release Date and stating that the conditions to the occurrence of the Release Date have been satisfied. When the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all or any part of the Bonds shall be satisfied or deemed satisfied pursuant to the Original Indenture or pursuant to this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall, upon written request of the Company, deliver to the Company without charge therefor all of the Bonds so satisfied or deemed satisfied, together with such appropriate instruments of transfer or release as may be reasonably requested by the Company. All Bonds delivered to the Company in accordance with this Section shall be delivered by the Company to the Mortgage Trustee for cancellation. SECTION 4.03. Substitute Mortgage Bonds. (a) The Company shall notify the Trustee not less than 90 days prior to the Release Date (or such shorter period as the Company and the Trustee may agree) that the Company has determined to deliver to the Trustee on the Release Date Substitute Mortgage Bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any other Securities subject to the release provisions Outstanding on the Release Date, in trust for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Notes and any other Securities subject to the release provisions issued under the Original Indenture, as supplemented, as security for any and all obligations of the Company under the Notes and any other Securities subject to the release provisions, including but not limited to, (1) the full and prompt payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on the Notes and any other Securities subject to the release provisions when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Original Indenture, as supplemented, or the Notes or such other Securities subject to the release provisions, either at the stated maturity thereof, upon acceleration of the maturity thereof or upon redemption, and (2) the full and prompt payment of any interest on the Notes and any other Securities subject to the release provisions when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Original Indenture, as supplemented, or the Notes or such other Securities subject to the release provisions. 18
(b) The Substitute Mortgage Bonds to be delivered pursuant to the notice described in Section 4.03(a) shall be delivered in separate series and issues corresponding to the series and issues of Notes and other Securities subject to the release provisions Outstanding on the Release Date, each series or issue of Substitute Mortgage Bonds having the same stated rate or rates of interest (or interest calculated in the same manner), Interest Payment Dates, stated maturity date and redemption provisions, and in the same aggregate principal amount, as the related series or issue of Notes or other Securities subject to the release provisions outstanding on the Release Date. The Company shall enter into a Substitute Mortgage for the issuance of Substitute Mortgage Bonds, and designate it as such in the notice. (c) The notice described in Section 4.03(a) shall also state that on the Release Date the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to the Original Indenture that will provide, among other things, that upon the issuance of Notes and other Securities subject to the release provisions on or after the Release Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Holders as described in Section 4.03(a) hereof, and the Trustee shall accept therefor, related series of Substitute Mortgage Bonds registered in the name of the Trustee and conforming to the requirements therein specified. (d) The determination whether to deliver Substitute Mortgage Bonds shall be made in the Company's sole discretion and without any obligation to do so. (e) In the event that the Company does not deliver the notice described in Section 4.03(a), the Notes and other Securities subject to the release provisions Outstanding on the Release Date shall, as of the Release Date, no longer be entitled to the benefit of the pledge of the Pledged Bonds and shall thereafter be general unsecured obligations of the Company. (f) Article Four and related provisions of the Original Indenture shall apply to Substitute Mortgage Bonds pledged to the Trustee hereunder and the provisions thereof shall be deemed to refer to the Substitute Mortgage and the Substitute Mortgage Bonds. If the Company elects to have the Notes secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds on and after the Release Date, Article Four and related provisions may be amended to make appropriate reference to the Substitute Mortgage and the Substitute Mortgage Bonds; provided, that the consent of Holders shall not be required in connection with such amendment. SECTION 4.04. Events of Default. (a) On and after the Release Date, Section 601(8) of the Original Indenture shall no longer apply to the Notes. For purposes of the Notes, Section 601(8) of the Original Indenture shall read "the occurrence of an "event of default" as such term is defined in the Mortgage; or" 19
(b) On and after the Release Date, if the Notes become secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds pursuant to Section 4.03 above, the occurrence of a "default" (as defined in the Substitute Mortgage) shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 601 of the Original Indenture with respect to the Notes and the references in Section 601(4) of the Original Indenture and related provisions to "Mortgage Bonds" shall be deemed to refer to "Substitute Mortgage Bonds." ARTICLE FIVE MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS The Trustee makes no undertaking or representations in respect of, and shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for and in respect of, the validity or sufficiency of this Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture or the proper authorization or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals and statements contained herein, all of which recitals and statements are made solely by the Company.

ON THE RELEASE DATE, THE NOTES SHALL CEASE TO BE SECURED BY SUCH MORTGAGE BONDS AND, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SHALL EITHER (1) BECOME UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY OR (2) BE SECURED BY SUBSTITUTE MORTGAGE BONDS UNDER A SUBSTITUTE MORTGAGE.

Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or a duly appointed Authentication Agent referred to herein, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to a Collateral Trust Indenture dated as of June 30, 1993 (the "Original Indenture") duly executed and delivered between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (herein referred to as the "Trustee"), as supplemented through and including a Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2005 (together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the registered Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is not subject to repayment at the option of the Holder hereof. Except as provided below, this Note is not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund. This Note will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (any such date of optional redemption, an "Optional Redemption Date," which shall be a "Redemption Date" for purposes of the Indenture), at an optional redemption price (which shall be a "Redemption Price" for purposes of the Indenture) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest of this Note to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Optional Redemption Date) until Stated Maturity, in each case discounted from their respective scheduled payment dates to such Optional Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Optional Redemption Date. A-3
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Note. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than two such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of: (i) Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date. Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to the Holder hereof at its registered address.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the registered Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each series affected at the time, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the registered Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate of or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the registered Holder of each Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the registered Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the registered Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting (i) the registered Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.

The Notes of this series are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. This Global Security is exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.

As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

MORGAN TRUST COMPANY, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (THE "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), PLEDGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HOLDERS OF THE NOTES TO THE TRUSTEE UNDER THE INDENTURE (THE "MORTGAGE"). ON THE RELEASE DATE, THE NOTES SHALL CEASE TO BE SECURED BY SUCH MORTGAGE BONDS AND, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SHALL EITHER (1) BECOME UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY OR (2) BE SECURED BY SUBSTITUTE MORTGAGE BONDS UNDER A SUBSTITUTE MORTGAGE. This Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee. Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or a duly appointed Authentication Agent referred to herein, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to a Collateral Trust Indenture dated as of June 30, 1993 (the "Original Indenture") duly executed and delivered between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (herein referred to as the "Trustee"), as supplemented through and including a Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2005 (together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the registered Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is not subject to repayment at the option of the Holder hereof. Except as provided below, this Note is not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund. This Note will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (any such date of optional redemption, an "Optional Redemption Date," which shall be a "Redemption Date" for purposes of the Indenture), at an optional redemption price (which shall be a "Redemption Price" for purposes of the Indenture) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest of this Note to be redeemed (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the Optional Redemption Date) until Stated Maturity, in each case discounted from their respective scheduled payment dates to such Optional Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. B-3
Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Optional Redemption Date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Note. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than two such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of: (i) Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date. Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to the Holder hereof at its registered address. If notice has been provided in accordance with the Indenture and funds for the redemption of this Note called for redemption have been made available on the Redemption Date, this Note will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for redemption. Thereafter, the only right of the Holder hereof will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price. The Company will notify the Trustee at least 60 days prior to giving notice of redemption (or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee) of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and the Redemption Date. If the Company elects to redeem all or a portion of the Notes, the redemption will be conditional upon receipt by the Paying Agent or the Trustee of monies sufficient to pay the Redemption Price. If the Notes are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Notes are to be redeemed in a manner it deems fair and appropriate in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. B-4
In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the registered Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the registered Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each series affected at the time, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the registered Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate of or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the registered Holder of each Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the registered Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the registered Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting (i) the registered Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such registered Holder and upon all future registered Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. Prior to the Release Date, the Notes of this series shall be secured by a series of Mortgage Bonds (the "Related Series of Bonds"), delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes. Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as Holder of the Related Series of Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Related Series of Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional Mortgage Bonds may be issued.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Notes of this series are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. This Global Security is exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.

As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

This bond and all other bonds of said series are issued and to be issued under, and are all equally and ratably secured (except insofar as any sinking, amortization, improvement or analogous fund, established in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture hereinafter mentioned, may afford additional security for the bonds of any particular series and except as provided in Section 3 of Article VI of said Indenture) by an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1924, duly executed by the Company to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to Bank One, National Association, as Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (including the Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2005) reference is hereby made for a description of the properties and franchises mortgaged and conveyed, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions upon which the bonds are issued and under which additional bonds may be issued, and the rights of the holders of the bonds and of the Trustee in respect of such security (which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, including the Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2005, are hereinafter collectively called the "Indenture"). As provided in the Indenture, said bonds may be for various principal sums and are issuable in series, which may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as in said Indenture provided. With the consent of the Company and to the extent permitted by and as provided in the Indenture, the rights and obligations of the Company and of the holders of the bonds and the terms and provisions 27
of the Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental thereto, may be modified or altered in certain respects by affirmative vote of at least eighty-five percent (85%) in amount of the bonds then outstanding, and, if the rights of one or more, but less than all, series of bonds then outstanding are to be affected by the action proposed to be taken, then also by affirmative vote of at least eighty-five percent (85%) in amount of the series of bonds so to be affected (excluding in every instance bonds disqualified from voting by reason of the Company's interest therein as specified in the Indenture); provided, however, that, without the consent of the holder hereof, no such modification or alteration shall, among other things, affect the terms of payment of the principal of or the interest on this bond, which in those respects is unconditional. This bond is redeemable prior to the Release Date upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, including provision for redemption upon demand of the Note Indenture Trustee following the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Note Indenture and the acceleration of the principal of the Notes. Under the Indenture, funds may be deposited with the Trustee (which shall have become available for payment), in advance of the redemption date of any of the bonds of 2005 Series B (or portions thereof), in trust for the redemption of such bonds (or portions thereof) and the interest due or to become due thereon, and thereupon all obligations of the Company in respect of such bonds (or portions thereof) so to be redeemed and such interest shall cease and be discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be restricted exclusively to such funds for any and all claims of whatsoever nature on their part under the Indenture or with respect to such bonds (or portions thereof) and interest. In case an event of default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all the bonds issued thereunder may become or be declared due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. Upon payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Article V of the Note Indenture, bonds of 2005 Series B in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Notes, and having both a corresponding maturity date and interest rate shall, to the extent of such payment of principal, premium or interest, be deemed fully paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall forthwith cease and be discharged, and, in the case of the payment of principal and premium, if any, such bonds of said 28
series shall be surrendered for cancellation or presented for appropriate notation to the Trustee. This bond is not assignable or transferable except as set forth under Section 405 of the Note Indenture or in the supplemental indenture relating to the Notes, or, subject to compliance with applicable law, as may be involved in the course of the exercise of rights and remedies consequent upon an Event of Default under the Note Indenture. Any such transfer shall be made by the registered holder hereof, in person or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, on the books of the Company kept at its office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon surrender and cancellation of this bond, and thereupon, a new registered bond of the same series of authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, and this bond with others in like form may in like manner be exchanged for one or more new bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations, but of the same aggregate principal amount, all as provided and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, and upon payment, in any event, of the charges prescribed in the Indenture. From and after the Release Date (as defined in the Note Indenture), the bonds of 2005 Series B shall be deemed fully paid, satisfied and discharged and the obligation of the Company thereunder shall be terminated. On the Release Date, the bonds of 2005 Series B shall be surrendered to and cancelled by the Trustee. The Company covenants and agrees that, prior to the Release Date, it will not take any action that would cause the outstanding principal amount of the bond of 2005 Series B to be less than the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, or against any past, present or future stockholder, director or officer, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether for amounts unpaid on stock subscriptions or by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise howsoever; all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released by every holder or owner hereof, as more fully provided in the Indenture. 29

(i) mail to each Holder a copy of the Prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents; (ii) keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 Business Days and not more than 30 Business Days after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders (or, in each case, longer if required by applicable law); (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective under the Act, supplemented and amended as required, under the Act to ensure that it is available for sales of New Securities by Exchanging Dealers during the Exchange Offer Registration Period; (iv) utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, which may be the Trustee, the New Securities Trustee or an Affiliate of either of them; (v) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last Business Day on which the Registered Exchange Offer is open; (vi) prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, provide a supplemental letter to the Commission (A) stating that the Company is conducting the Registered Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the Commission in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (pub. avail. May 13, 1988), Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (pub. avail. June 5, 1991); and (B) including a representation that the Company has not entered into any arrangement or understanding with any person to distribute the New Securities to be received in the Registered Exchange Offer and that, to the best of the Company's information and belief, each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer is acquiring the New Securities in the ordinary course of business and has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the New Securities; and (vii) comply in all respects with all applicable laws. (d) As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall: (i) accept for exchange all Securities tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer; (ii) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation in accordance with Section 4(s) all Securities so accepted for exchange; and (iii) cause the New Securities Trustee promptly to authenticate and deliver to each Holder of Securities a principal amount of New Securities equal to the principal amount of the Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange. 5
(e) Each Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that any Broker-Dealer and any such Holder using the Registered Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of the New Securities (x) could not under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement rely on the position of the Commission in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (pub. avail. May 13, 1988) and Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (pub. avail. June 5, 1991), as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993 and similar no-action letters; and (y) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Act in connection with any secondary resale transaction, which must be covered by an effective registration statement containing the selling security holder information required by Item 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K under the Act if the resales are of New Securities obtained by such Holder in exchange for Securities acquired by such Holder directly from the Company or one of its Affiliates. Accordingly, each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that, at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer: (i) any New Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of business; (ii) such Holder will have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Securities or the New Securities within the meaning of the Act; and (iii) such Holder is not an Affiliate of the Company. (f) If any Initial Purchaser determines that it is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer with respect to the exchange of Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, at the request of such Initial Purchaser, the Company shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser or the person purchasing New Securities registered under a Shelf Registration Statement as contemplated by Section 3 hereof from such Initial Purchaser, in exchange for such Securities, a like principal amount of New Securities. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the CUSIP Service Bureau to issue the same CUSIP number for such New Securities as for New Securities issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer. 3. Shelf Registration. (a) If (i) due to any change in law or applicable interpretations thereof by the Commission's staff, the Company determines upon advice of its outside counsel that it is not permitted to effect the Registered Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 2 hereof; (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 60 days following the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement; (iii) for any other reason the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 240 days of the Closing Date; (iv) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to Securities that are not eligible to be exchanged for New Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and that are held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer; (v) any Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer; or (vi) in the case of any Initial Purchaser that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer or acquires New Securities pursuant to Section 2(f) hereof, such Initial Purchaser does not receive freely tradeable New Securities in exchange for Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment (it being understood that (x) the requirement that an Initial Purchaser deliver a Prospectus containing the information 6
required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Act in connection with sales of New Securities acquired in exchange for such Securities shall result in such New Securities being not "freely tradeable"; and (y) the requirement that an Exchanging Dealer deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales of New Securities acquired in the Registered Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities shall not result in such New Securities being not "freely tradeable"), the Company shall effect a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with subsection (b) below. (b) (i) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 60 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 3 ), file with the Commission and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective under the Act within 150 days after so required or requested, a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Securities or the New Securities, as applicable, by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder; and provided further, that with respect to New Securities received by an Initial Purchaser in exchange for Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, the Company may, if permitted by current interpretations by the Commission's staff, file a post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection with respect thereto, and any such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as so amended, shall be referred to herein as, and governed by the provisions herein applicable to, a Shelf Registration Statement. (ii) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the Act, in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period the "Shelf Registration Period") from the date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission until (A) the second anniversary of the Closing Date or (B) the date upon which all the Securities or New Securities, as applicable, covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company shall be deemed not to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Registration Period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities at any time during the Shelf Registration Period, unless such action is (x) required by applicable law or otherwise undertaken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including the acquisition or divestiture of assets, and (y) permitted pursuant to Section 4(k)(ii) hereof. (iii) The Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, (A) to 7
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act; and (B) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. 4. Additional Registration Procedures. In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement and, to the extent applicable, any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the following provisions shall apply. (a) The Company shall: (i) furnish to each of the Representatives and to counsel for the Holders, not less than five Business Days prior to the filing thereof with the Commission, a copy of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any Shelf Registration Statement, and each amendment thereof and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein (including all documents incorporated by reference therein after the initial filing) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed with the Commission, such comments as the Representatives reasonably propose; (ii) include the information set forth in Annex A hereto on the facing page of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, in Annex B hereto in the forepart of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement in a section setting forth details of the Exchange Offer, in Annex C hereto in the underwriting or plan of distribution section of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and in Annex D hereto in the letter of transmittal delivered pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer; (iii) if requested by an Initial Purchaser, include the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, in the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement; and (iv) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, include the names of the Holders that propose to sell Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement as selling security holders. (b) The Company shall ensure that: (i) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any Prospectus forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Act; and (ii) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 8
(c) The Company shall advise the Representatives, the Holders of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement and any Exchanging Dealer under any Exchange Offer Registration Statement that has provided in writing to the Company a telephone or facsimile number and address for notices, and, if requested by any Representative or any such Holder or Exchanging Dealer, shall confirm such advice in writing (which notice pursuant to clauses (ii)-(v) hereof shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the Company shall have remedied the basis for such suspension): (i) when a Registration Statement and any amendment thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the securities included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of the happening of any event that requires any change in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus so that, as of such date, they (A) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and (B) do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. (d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the qualification of the securities therein for sale in any jurisdiction and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (e) The Company shall furnish to each Holder of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, at least one copy of such Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including all material incorporated therein by reference, and, if the Holder so requests in writing, all exhibits thereto (including exhibits incorporated by reference therein). (f) The Company shall, during the Shelf Registration Period, deliver to each Holder of Securities covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including any preliminary Prospectus) included in such Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or 9
supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of Securities in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities covered by the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Shelf Registration Statement. (g) The Company shall furnish to each Exchanging Dealer which so requests, without charge, at least one copy of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including all material incorporated by reference therein, and, if the Exchanging Dealer so requests in writing, all exhibits thereto (including exhibits incorporated by reference therein). (h) The Company shall promptly deliver to each Initial Purchaser, each Exchanging Dealer and each other person required to deliver a Prospectus during the Exchange Offer Registration Period, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as any such person may reasonably request. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any Initial Purchaser, any Exchanging Dealer and any such other person that may be required to deliver a Prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer in connection with the offering and sale of the New Securities covered by the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. (i) Prior to the Registered Exchange Offer or any other offering of Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Company shall arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities or the New Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder shall reasonably request and shall maintain such qualification in effect so long as required; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the Initial Placement, the Registered Exchange Offer or any offering pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (j) The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing New Securities or Securities to be issued or sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as Holders may request. (k) (i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by subsections (c)(ii) through (v) above, the Company shall promptly (or within the time period provided for by clause (ii) hereof, if applicable) prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the applicable Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Initial Purchasers of the securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such circumstances, the period of effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 2 shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of a notice of suspension pursuant to Section 4(c) to and including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the 10
Holders of the Securities and any known Exchanging Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented Prospectus pursuant to this Section. (ii) Upon the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development or any other material event that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of a Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus, the Company shall give notice (without notice of the nature or details of such events) to the Holders that the availability of the Shelf Registration is suspended and, upon actual receipt of any such notice, each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration until such Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in Section 3(i) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in such Prospectus. The period during which the availability of the Shelf Registration and any Prospectus is suspended (the "Deferral Period") shall not exceed 60 days in any three-month period or 90 days in any twelve-month period. (l) Not later than the effective date of any Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a CUSIP number for the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, registered under such Registration Statement and provide the Trustee with printed certificates for such Securities or New Securities, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company. (m) The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and shall make generally available to its security holders an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act as soon as practicable after the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement and in any event no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement. (n) The Company shall cause the New Securities Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act in a timely manner. (o) The Company may require each Holder of securities to be sold pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in such Registration Statement. The Company may exclude from such Shelf Registration Statement the Securities of any Holder that unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. (p) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall enter into customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all other appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of the Securities, and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is 11
entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable than those set forth in Section 6 hereof. (q) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall: (i) make reasonably available during regular business hours for inspection by the Holders of Securities to be registered thereunder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records and pertinent corporate documents of the Company and its subsidiaries; (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's independent certified public accountants, to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any such Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations; (iii) make such representations and warranties to the Holders of Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by the Company to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings and covering matters including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Purchase Agreement; (iv) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters, if any) addressed to each selling Holder and the underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in the Company's underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and underwriters; (v) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with the Company's primary underwritten offerings; and (vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders or the Managing Underwriters, if any, including those to evidence compliance with Section 4(k) and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the Company. 12
The actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this paragraph (q) shall be performed at (A) the effectiveness of such Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto; and (B) each closing under any underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder. (r) In the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall, if requested by an Initial Purchaser, or by a broker dealer that holds Securities that were acquired as a result of market making or other trading activities: (i) make reasonably available during regular business hours for inspection by the requesting party and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the requesting party, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries; (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's independent certified public accountants, to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the requesting party or any such attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any such Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations; (iii) make such representations and warranties to the requesting party, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by the Company to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings and covering matters including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Purchase Agreement; (iv) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the requesting party and its counsel, addressed to the requesting party, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in the Company's underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the requesting party or its counsel; (v) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to the requesting party, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with the Company's primary underwritten offerings, or if requested by the requesting party or its counsel in lieu of a "comfort" letter, an agreed-upon procedures letter under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 35, covering matters requested by the requesting party or its counsel; and (vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the requesting party or its counsel, including those to evidence 13
compliance with Section 4(k) and with conditions customarily contained in underwriting agreements. The foregoing actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this Section shall be performed at the close of the Registered Exchange Offer and the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. (s) If a Registered Exchange Offer is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the New Securities, the Company shall mark, or caused to be marked, on the Securities so exchanged that such Securities are being cancelled in exchange for the New Securities. In no event shall the Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied. (t) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Securities, or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement, to be rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency. (u) In the event that any Broker-Dealer shall underwrite any Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the NASD Rules) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company shall assist such Broker-Dealer in complying with the NASD Rules. (v) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration and issuance of the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement, including, without limitation, obtaining all necessary consents, approvals, authorizations or orders of any governmental agency or authority, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 5. Registration Expenses. The Company shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof and, in the event of any Shelf Registration Statement, will reimburse the Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel (which shall initially be Dewey Ballantine LLP, but which may be another nationally recognized law firm experienced in securities matters designated by the Majority Holders) to act as counsel for the Holders in connection therewith, and, in the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel acting in connection therewith. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement, each Initial Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer and each person who controls any such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange 14
Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Holder, or director, officer, employee, Affiliate or agent of such Holder, or any person who controls any such Holder (other than any Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer, or the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of any such Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer or any person who controls any such Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer) in any such case unless the party claiming indemnification was required to deliver a copy of such preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, and did, in fact, make such delivery; and provided, further, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have. The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof. (b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it 15
from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, selected counsel may be counsel to the indemnifying party, unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of separate counsel for the indemnified party or (ii) in the written opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them or defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from, additional to or in competition with those available to the indemnifying party, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (including disbursements) for such indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the indemnified parties are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses for more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. (d) In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of counsel (to the extent the indemnifying party does not assume the defense) or any separate counsel for the indemnified parties shall be reasonable, the Holders and the Company agree that the indemnifying party's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following: (i) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the indemnified parties pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the indemnified parties shall, if appropriate, in good faith fully consult with the indemnifying party in advance as to the selection of such counsel; and (ii) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the indemnifying party of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege) and presented to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable following receipt of such counsel's invoice. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, 16
any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 6, to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss, damage, liability or expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment. (e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Securities purchased by such Initial Purchaser, or in the case of New Securities, applicable to the Securities that were exchangeable into such New Securities, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions as set forth on the cover page of the Final Memorandum, and benefits received by any other Holder shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds realized by such Holder from the sale of Securities or New Securities, as applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information 17
and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e). (f) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement. 7. Underwritten Registrations. (a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders. (b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Registration Defaults. Additional interest ("Additional Interest") with respect to the Registrable Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (a) through (f) being herein called a "Registration Default"): (a) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the 90th day following the Closing Date; or (b) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 180th day following the Closing Date; or (c) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to the 60th day following the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement; or (d) any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such filing in this Agreement; or 18
(e) any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness under this Agreement; or (f) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective, or is unusable for its intended purpose, without being succeeded within 45 Business Days by post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or, an additional Registration Statement, filed and declared effective. Additional Interest shall accrue on the Registrable Securities (and on the Company's Pledged Bonds (as defined in the Indenture) pledged under the Indenture with respect to such Securities) over and above the interest set forth in the title of such Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate (the "Additional Interest Rate") of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period, but in no event shall the Additional Interest Rate exceed 0.50% per annum. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults, the accrual of Additional Interest shall cease. 9. Rules 144 and 144A. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act. 10. No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered into, and agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. 11. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding; provided that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such 19
Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective; provided, further, that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 11 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Initial Purchasers and each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement. 12. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail, telex, telecopier or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such holder to the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12, which address initially is, with respect to each Holder, the address of such Holder maintained by the Registrar under the Indenture; (b) if to the Representatives, initially at the address or addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and (c) if to the Company, initially at its address set forth in the Purchase Agreement. All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when received. The Initial Purchasers or the Company by notice to the other parties may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. 13. Remedies. Each Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided to it herein, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 14. Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Company thereto, subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities, and the indemnified persons referred to in Section 6 hereof. The Company hereby agrees to extend the benefits of this Agreement to any Holder of Registrable Securities, and any 20
such Holder may specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if an original party hereto. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. 17. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York. The parties hereto each hereby waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement. 18. Severability. In the event that any one of more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the parties shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 19. Securities Held by the Company, etc. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of principal amount of Securities or New Securities is required hereunder, Securities or New Securities, as applicable, held by the Company or its Affiliates (other than subsequent Holders of Securities or New Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be Affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Securities or New Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage. 21
