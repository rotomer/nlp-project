:
     On Thursday, April 28, 2005, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued its final order on Michigan Consolidated Gas Company's (MichCon's) request for rate relief in case numbers U-13898/13899. This document provides a preliminary summary of key provisions of this order. MichCon appreciates the hard work of the MPSC and the MPSC Staff in completing this case.
     The MPSC determined that MichCon has a base rate revenue deficiency of $60.8 million in 2005. This amount is an increase of $25.5 million over the $35.3 million in interim rate relief approved in September 2004. The final rate relief is similar to the $60.3 million in final relief recommended by the administrative law judge (ALJ). In MichCon's original September 2003 request, it requested a base rate increase of $194 million, which it subsequently revised to $159 million by accepting several adjustments suggested by the Staff and revising its depreciation rates based on recent MPSC orders. Table 1 reconciles the MPSC's final rate order with the ALJ's recommendation and with MichCon's final request.
     For average residential customers using 125 Mcf per year, the increase in non-gas charges from currently effective rates is approximately $2 per month, a 9% increase. The total increase on customers since MichCon last increased non-gas rates in January 1994 is approximately $3.50, a 16% increase.
