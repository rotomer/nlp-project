Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
DTE Energy Company is the indirect parent company of DTE Energy Technologies (Dtech), which assembles, markets, distributes and services distributed generation products, provides application engineering, and monitors and manages on-site generation system operations. On July 26, 2005, management approved the restructuring of this business in which certain assets and liabilities are to be sold, certain businesses are to be terminated and certain businesses are to be merged with The Detroit Edison Company or one of its subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2005, the restructuring plan had not met the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "," criteria to classify the assets as "held for sale," and accordingly no impairment loss was recorded in the 2005 second quarter. We expect to recognize a net of tax impairment loss of approximately $25 million to $30 million in the 2005 third and fourth quarters representing the write-down to fair value of the assets of Dtech, less costs to sell, and the write-off of goodwill. As required under SFAS No. 144, we expect to report Dtech's operating results as a discontinued operation beginning with the 2005 third quarter.
