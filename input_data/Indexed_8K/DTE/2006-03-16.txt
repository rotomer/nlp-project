Safe Harbor Statement
The information contained herein  is as of the date of this presentation.  DTE Energy expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information or future events or developments.  Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "projected" and "goals" signify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties.  This presentation contains forward-looking statements about DTE Energy's financial results and estimates of future prospects, and actual results may differ materially.  Factors that may impact forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the higher price of oil and its impact on the value of production tax credits, and the ability to utilize and/or sell interests in facilities producing such credits; the uncertainties of successful exploration of gas shale resources and inability to estimate gas reserves with certainty;
the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on operations and sales to customers, and purchases from suppliers; economic climate and population growth or decline in the geographic areas where we do business; environmental issues, laws, regulations, and the cost of remediation and compliance; nuclear regulations and operations associated with nuclear facilities; implementation of electric and gas Customer Choice programs; impact of electric and gas utility restructuring in Michigan, including legislative amendments; employee relations and the impact of collective bargaining agreements; unplanned outages; access to capital markets and capital market conditions and the results of other financing efforts which can be affected by credit agency ratings; the timing and extent of changes in interest rates; the level of borrowings; changes in the cost and availability of coal and other raw materials, purchased power and natural gas; effects of competition; impact of regulation by the FERC, MPSC, NRC and other applicable governmental  proceedings and regulations; contributions to earnings by non-utility subsidiaries; changes in federal, state and local tax laws and their interpretations, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, rulings, court proceedings and audits;  the ability to recover costs through rate increases; the availability, cost, coverage and terms of insurance; the cost of protecting assets against, or damage due to, terrorism; changes in accounting standards and financial reporting regulations; changes in federal or state laws and their interpretation with respect to regulation, energy policy and other business issues; uncollectible accounts receivable; litigation and related appeals; and changes in the economic and financial viability of our suppliers, customers and trading counterparties, and the continued ability of such parties to perform their obligations to the Company. This presentation should also be read in conjunction with the "Forward-Looking Statements" section in each of DTE Energy's, MichCon's and Detroit Edison's 2005 Form 10-K (which sections are incorporated herein by reference), and in conjunction with other SEC reports filed by DTE Energy, MichCon and Detroit Edison.
Cautionary Note  The Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use certain terms in this presentation such as "probable reserves" that the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. You are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, File No. 1-11607, available from our offices or from our website at www.dteenergy.com. You can also obtain these Forms from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

Reconciliations
In this presentation, DTE Energy provides 2006 guidance for operating earnings, non-utility operating net income and non-utility operating net income in areas of expected future capital investment.  It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2006 reported results will be excluded from operating results.  A reconciliation to the comparable 2006 reported earnings/net income guidance is not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items such as 2007 oil hedging costs, Performance Excellence Process restructuring charges and DTE2 implementation charges.  These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
2006 Reported Earnings to Operating Earnings
Non-Utility Operating Net Income in areas of Expected Future Capital Investment to Non-Utility Reported Earnings

Use of Non-Utility Operating Net Income  DTE Energy management believes that non-utility operating net income provides a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing non-utility operations and this measure as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses this measure to gauge performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
Use of Non-Utility Operating Net Income in areas of Expected Future Capital Investment -  DTE Energy management believes the use of this measure provides a meaningful depiction, for external communications with analysts and investors, of the net income growth in the non-utility businesses where the company expects to invest significant capital in the future.
