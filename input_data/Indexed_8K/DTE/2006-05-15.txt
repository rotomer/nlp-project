ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. In connection with the matter described in Item 8.01, DTE Energy Company ("DTE Energy") is furnishing the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") with its press release issued by May 15, 2006, which announced that it is maintaining its operating earnings guidance, excluding Synfuels. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 7.01., including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing. ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS DTE Energy today announced it idled production at all nine synthetic fuel ("synfuel") facilities operated by the company. The decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the current level and volatility of oil prices and the lack of federal legislation that would have provided certainty for production economics this year. Synthetic fuel production may resume, depending on various factors, including a reduction in oil prices or the enactment of potential federal legislation. DTE Energy retains production flexibility that could allow it to make up lost production during the remainder of 2006 if the current shutdown remains limited in duration. DTE Energy holds a majority interest in two of the nine synthetic fuel production facilities and minority interests in the remaining seven facilities. Synthetic fuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules. The production and sale of synthetic fuel
produced at these facilities generates production tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code. The value of these credits is dependent on the full-year average price of oil for the year in which the credits are generated. While the full-year average price of oil cannot be known with certainty prior to the end of the year, current high oil prices suggest that credits' value could be partially or fully phased out for 2006. Legislation was proposed in Congress for inclusion in the recent tax reconciliation bill that would have impacted the potential phase-out of production tax credits for 2006 and 2007. However, this provision was not included in the reconciliation bill as enacted. The proposed legislation is under consideration for inclusion in subsequent legislation, such as the "extenders" bill. If included and enacted as proposed, then there would be no phase-out of tax credits for 2006 and DTE Energy could resume production at the synthetic fuel facilities it operates. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (d) Exhibits FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties. It should be read in conjunction with the "Forward-Looking Statements" section in DTE Energy's 2005 Form 10-K (which section is incorporated by reference herein), and in conjunction with other SEC reports filed by DTE Energy that discuss important factors that could cause DTE Energy's actual results to differ materially. DTE Energy expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained in this report as a result of new information or future events or developments.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 May 15, 2006 DTE ENERGY IDLES SYNTHETIC FUEL PRODUCTION DETROIT -- DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today announced it idled production at all nine synthetic fuel (synfuel) facilities operated by the company. The decision to idle synfuel production was driven by the current level and volatility of oil prices and the lack of federal legislation that would have provided certainty for production economics this year. Synthetic fuel production may resume, depending on various factors, including a reduction in oil prices or the enactment of potential federal legislation. DTE Energy retains production flexibility that could allow it to make up lost production during the remainder of 2006 if the current shutdown remains limited in duration. The company is maintaining its operating earnings guidance, excluding synfuels, of $2.41-$2.66. Previously, the company provided earnings guidance of $3.60-$3.90 per diluted share, which included $1.19-$1.24 of synfuel earnings per diluted share. However, given the uncertainties around the amount and timing of synfuel production and the ultimate value of the related tax credits, the company is not providing synfuel earnings guidance at this time. The company believes that cash flow generated by the synfuel operations is more indicative of its inherent value than the earnings generated. Therefore, the company previously entered into oil options to protect a portion of expected synfuel cash flow and to a lesser extent operating earnings. Prior to this announcement, DTE Energy provided synfuel cash guidance of $450 million to $470 million. The company believes that a significant portion of the expected 2006 cash flow will be realized through a combination of synfuel operations and settlement of the oil options. However, the ultimate realized synfuel cash and operating earnings will depend on the market for the oil options and underlying oil prices, at the time of settlement. These potential impacts are discussed in the company's 2005 Form 10K and first quarter 2006 Form 10Q. The company has produced approximately 8 million tons of synfuels in 2006. DTE Energy will provide further updates on its synfuel operations and earnings guidance as conditions warrant. - more -
- 2 - SYNTHETIC FUEL BACKGROUND DTE Energy holds a majority interest in two of the nine synthetic fuel production facilities and minority interests in the remaining seven facilities. Synthetic fuel facilities chemically change coal, including waste and marginal coal, into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules. The production and sale of synthetic fuel produced at these facilities generates production tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code. The value of these credits is dependent on the full-year average price of oil for the year in which the credits are generated. While the full-year average price of oil cannot be known with certainty prior to the end of the year, current high oil prices suggest that credits' value could be partially or fully phased out for 2006. Legislation was proposed in Congress for inclusion in the recent tax reconciliation bill that would have impacted the potential phase-out of production tax credits for 2006 and 2007. However, this provision was not included in the reconciliation bill as enacted. The proposed legislation is under consideration for inclusion in subsequent legislation, such as the "extenders" bill. If included and enacted as proposed, then there would be no phase-out of tax credits for 2006 and DTE Energy could resume production at the synthetic fuel facilities it operates. For a more detailed disclosure of the company's synthetic fuel operations, please refer to the most recent DTE Energy Form 10-Q which is available at dteenergy.com/investors. Use of Operating Earnings Information -- DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors. In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2006 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2006 reported results will be excluded from operating results. A reconciliation to the comparable 2006 reported earnings guidance is not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items such as 2007 oil hedging costs and other charges. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings. - more -
