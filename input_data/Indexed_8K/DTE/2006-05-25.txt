To the Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     DTE Energy Company, a Michigan corporation (the "Company") proposes to issue and sell severally to the firms named in Schedule I hereto (such firms constituting the "Underwriters") $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2006 Series B 6.35% Notes due 2016 with the terms specified in Schedule II hereto (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2001, as supplemented, and as to be supplemented by a Supplemental Indenture establishing the Securities (the "Indenture"), between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company (successor to The Bank of New York), as Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the time and place and at the purchase price to the Underwriters set forth in Schedule II hereto, the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. The sale of the Securities will be made to the Underwriters, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in Schedule II hereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.
     2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters, on and as of the date hereof and the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4) that:
          (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-99955, 333-99955-01 and 333-99955-02) with respect to the Securities and other securities, copies of which have been delivered to the Underwriters, has been prepared and filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Such registration statement, including a prospectus, has been declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and no stop order suspending its effectiveness and/or notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The term "Registration Statement," at any given time, means such registration statement, including any amendments thereto and any prospectus relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and deemed part of such Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act at such time. Each date the Registration Statement or any amendment (or any part thereof) is considered to have become effective as to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 11(d) of the Act and Rule 430B(f) promulgated thereunder is herein called the "Effective Date." The base prospectus included in the Registration Statement
 
relating to the Securities and certain other issues of securities (exclusive of any supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act) is herein called the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus as amended and supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 23, 2006 relating to the Securities immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Prospectus." The Company proposes to file together with the Basic Prospectus and pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a final prospectus supplement specifically related to the Securities and reflecting the terms of the Securities and plan of distribution arising from this Agreement (herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement") and has previously advised the Underwriters of all the information to be set forth therein. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the Final Prospectus Supplement, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424.
     Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein, or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, and filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable; any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include, without limitation, the filing of any document under the Exchange Act deemed to be incorporated therein by reference after the date of such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus.
     For purposes of this Agreement, the "Applicable Time" is 4:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of this Agreement; the documents listed on Schedule V hereto, taken together, are collectively referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package".
          (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

          (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply, so far as it is able, with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a securities dealer or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to comply with any other requirements deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome;

Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;
          (d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); and

          (viii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (1) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel after due inquiry, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the properties or assets of the Company is subject, or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except (i) that such counsel need express no opinion as to rights to indemnity which may be limited by applicable law, and (ii) any such conflict, breach, violation or default that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency (including, without limitation, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("PSC")) or any other body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities by the Company or execution, delivery, performance and consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Securities or the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;

Disclosure Package and Prospectus), are accurate and fair summaries in all material respects;
          (xi) The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be, an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
          (xii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein and except for those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and, although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in such documents, such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
          (xiii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filings of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, have been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act; the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (x) of this Section 8(c), such counsel has no reason to believe that (A) as of each applicable Effective Date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the
 
Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) as of the Applicable Time, the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and
          (xiv) such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;
          (d) On each of the date hereof and at the Time of Delivery, the independent accountants of the Company who have audited the audited financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, each in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, the first dated the date hereof, and the second dated the Time of Delivery reaffirming the statements made in their letter dated the date hereof. The specified date referred to in the letter delivered on the date hereof shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the date hereof and the specified date referred to in the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery shall be a date not more than three business days prior to such Time of Delivery;
          (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, and (ii) since the respective dates as of
 
which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change (other than such as may have occurred in the ordinary course of business) in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (f) At the Time of Delivery, the Securities shall be rated at least "Baa2" (negative outlook) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and "BBB-" (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., respectively, and the Company shall have delivered to the Underwriters a letter from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Underwriters, confirming that the Securities have such ratings on such date;
          (g) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or otherwise given any notice of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change;
          (h) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal, or New York State authorities, (iv) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other crisis or calamity, or (v) any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, if the effect of any such event specified in clauses (iv) and (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus;
          (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the business day next succeeding the date hereof; and
          (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to
 
the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a), (f) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein or with respect to any statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement that shall constitute the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act of the Indenture Trustee; and that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to the Pricing Disclosure Package shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Pricing Disclosure Package contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in an amended or supplemented Preliminary Prospectus or, where permitted by law, an issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) and such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus was provided to such Underwriter far enough in advance of the Applicable Time so that such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus could have been provided to such person prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) the Underwriter did not convey the information in such corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) to such person at or prior to the Applicable Time, and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the Underwriter conveyed the information in the corrected Preliminary Prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus (excluding any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference) to such person as contemplated in clause (iii) above.
provided, however,
provided, further,
 
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its directors, officers, employees, and agents and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by each such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, selected counsel may be counsel to the indemnifying party, unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of separate counsel for the indemnified party or (ii) in the opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them or defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from, additional to or in competition with those available to the indemnifying party, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (including disbursements) for such indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the indemnified parties are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses for more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such indemnified parties.
 
          (d) In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of counsel (to the extent the indemnifying party does not assume the defense) or any separate counsel for the indemnified parties shall be reasonable, the Underwriters and the Company agree that the indemnifying party's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
          (i) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the indemnified parties pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the indemnified parties shall, if appropriate, in good faith fully consult with the indemnifying party in advance as to the selection of such counsel; and
          (ii) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the indemnifying party of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege) and presented to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable following receipt of such counsel's invoice.
No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified parties, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party or parties is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party or parties from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party or parties.
     The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 9, to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss, damage, liability or expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above and the indemnifying party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure, then each
 
indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to
 
effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters (and approved in writing by the Representatives) in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of Securities, but
 
the Company shall not then be under further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in this Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in Schedule II hereto; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of arm's length contractual counterparties to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, no Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.
