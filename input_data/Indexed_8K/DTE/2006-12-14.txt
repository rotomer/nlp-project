Indentures
     The Detroit Edison Company ("Detroit Edison") and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture dated as of December 1, 2006 in connection with the issuance by Detroit Edison on December 8, 2006 of $68,500,000 aggregate principal amount of 2006 Series CT Variable Rate Senior Notes due 2036 (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued in conjunction with the municipal bond insurance arrangements for the issuance of $68,500,000 Michigan Strategic Fund Variable Rate Limited Obligation Revenue Bonds (The Detroit Edison Company Exempt Facilities Project), Series 2006CT (the "Revenue Bonds") by the Michigan Strategic Fund, a public body corporate and politic of the State of Michigan, the proceeds of which were loaned to Detroit Edison pursuant to the Loan Agreement described below. Interest on the Notes accrues on a basis consistent with the Revenue Bonds at a variable rate as established for the Revenue Bonds from time to time.
     The Notes are secured by a corresponding series of Detroit Edison's General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 2006 Series CT (the "Mortgage Bonds"). The Mortgage Bonds were issued pursuant to a supplemental indenture between Detroit Edison and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee, dated as of December 1, 2006.
Loan Agreement
     Detroit Edison entered into a Loan Agreement dated as of December 1, 2006 with the Michigan Strategic Fund ("Issuer"). The Loan Agreement provides for the issue and sale of the Revenue Bonds described above by the Issuer and the loan by the Issuer of the proceeds of the Revenue Bonds to Detroit Edison. Detroit Edison will use the proceeds to finance the construction, acquisition, improvement and installation of certain solid waste disposal facilities at Detroit Edison's Monroe Power Plant located in the City of Monroe, County of Monroe, Michigan (the "Project"), including reimbursing Detroit Edison for prior expenditures related to the Project. The terms of the Loan Agreement substantially mirror the terms of the Revenue Bonds.
     The Supplemental Indentures are filed together with the Loan Agreement as exhibits to this Current Report, and the description of each document above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indentures and the Loan Agreement.

For purposes of the Original Indenture, the Notes shall constitute a single series of Securities. The Stated Maturity on which the principal of the Notes shall be due and payable will be December 1, 2036. The Notes are being issued to secure the Company's obligations to the Insurer under the Insurance Agreement.
     SECTION 2.02. Certain Variations from the Original Indenture.
     (a) The Notes shall have the benefit of the provisions of Article Four of the Original Indenture and shall have the benefit of, or be subject to, the other related provisions of the Original Indenture relating to the grant of security, including (for avoidance of doubt and not for purposes of limitation) the Granting Clause, the definitions of "Deliverable Mortgage Bonds," "Deliverable Securities," "Designated Mortgage Bonds," "Grant," "Mortgage," "Mortgage Bonds," "Mortgage Trustee," "Previously Delivered Mortgage Bonds," and "Trust Estate," Section 301(20), Section 301(a), Section 301(b), Section 301(d), and Article VI, subject, in each case, to the release provisions provided for in Section 4.02 herein. In addition, on and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, the Notes shall have the benefit of the additional covenants set forth in Article Three hereof.
     (b) In the event the Company desires to provide for the payment of the Notes, in lieu of defeasing the Notes in accordance with Section 503 of the Original Indenture, it shall either redeem an equal principal amount of the 2006CT Bonds or take such action as shall be required by Article VIII of the Bond Indenture to defease an equal principal amount of the 2006CT Bonds. Pursuant to Section 2.03(c) hereof, such redemption or defeasance shall result in the discharge of the Company's obligation with respect to the Notes and the cancellation of the Notes.
     (c) Any amount payable by the Company in respect of principal of the Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or upon redemption or acceleration or otherwise, in a circumstance where there has not been a corresponding payment of principal of 2006CT Bonds,
 
shall be applied simultaneously to the redemption or defeasance of an equal principal amount of 2006CT Bonds in accordance with the Bond Indenture. In the event the amount so paid is insufficient to provide for such redemption or defeasance, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as shall be necessary to make up the deficiency.
     SECTION 2.03. Amount, Assignability and Redemption.
     (a) The aggregate principal amount of Notes that may be issued under this Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture is limited to $68,500,000 (except as provided in Section 301(2) of the Original Indenture). The Notes shall be issuable only in fully registered form and, as permitted by Section 301 and Section 302 of the Original Indenture, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof to the Insurer. The Notes shall not be assignable or transferable except as may be required to effect a transfer to any successor insurer for the 2006CT Bonds.
     (b) The Notes may bear such legends as may be necessary to refer to the Insurance Agreement between the Company and the Insurer or to comply with any law or with any rules or regulations made pursuant thereto or to evidence the limited assignability.
     (c) Upon payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on the 2006CT Bonds, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise, or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Article IV or VIII of the Bond Indenture, Notes in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the 2006CT Bonds shall, to the extent of such payment of principal, premium or interest, be deemed fully paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall forthwith cease and be discharged, and, in the case of the payment of principal and premium, if any, such Notes shall be surrendered for cancellation or presented for appropriate notation to the Trustee.
     (d) The Notes shall be redeemed on the date and in the principal amount which corresponds to the redemption date for, and the principal amount to be redeemed of, the 2006CT Bonds.
     (e) In the event of an Event of Default under the Bond Indenture and the acceleration of the 2006CT Bonds, the Notes shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee of a written demand (Redemption Demand) from the Insurer indicating that it has paid accelerated principal.
     SECTION 2.04. Certain Terms of the Notes.
     (a) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of interest established for the 2006CT Bonds from time to time in accordance with the Bond Indenture on the principal amount thereof from the date of original issue, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal of the Notes becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum during such overdue period. Interest on the Notes will be payable on such dates as interest shall be payable on the 2006CT Bonds (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"). Payment of interest on the 2006CT Bonds shall be deemed to constitute payment of interest on the Notes. The
 
amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the same basis as interest on the 2006CT Bonds pursuant to the Bond Indenture.
     (b) In the event that any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or other date of Maturity of the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the amount payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date with respect to any Note will, as provided in the Original Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in the Original Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the relevant record date for such interest installment, which shall be the same as the record date for the 2006CT Bonds with respect to the relevant Interest Payment Date (the "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of the Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture. The principal of, and premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Any waiver or rescission of a declaration of acceleration of principal of the 2006CT Bonds shall constitute a waiver or rescission with respect to the Notes.
     (c) The Notes are not subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof and are not subject to any sinking fund, except to the extent that the Insurer, or its successor in interest, may have exercised its rights pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof. As provided in the form of the Note attached hereto as Exhibit A, the Notes are subject to Optional Redemption and Extraordinary Optional Redemption, as a whole or in part, and Special Optional Redemption, in whole, by the Company prior to Stated Maturity of the principal thereof upon the same terms as the 2006CT Bonds. Except as modified in the form of Note, redemptions shall be effected in accordance with Article Twelve of the Original Indenture.
     (d) The Notes shall have such other terms and provisions as are set forth in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A (which is incorporated by reference in and made a part of this Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture as if set forth in full at this place).
     SECTION 2.05. Form of Note. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the form of the definitive Note. If the Company elects to have the Notes secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds on and after the Release Date, the terms of the Notes shall be amended to make appropriate reference to the Substitute Mortgage and the Substitute Mortgage Bonds; provided, that the consent of Holders shall not be required in connection with such amendment.
 
     SECTION 3.01. Limitations on Liens.
     (a) From and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company may not issue, assume, guarantee (including any contingent obligation to purchase) or permit to exist any Debt that is secured by any mortgage, security interest, pledge or lien ("Lien") of or upon any Operating Property owned by the Company, whether owned at the Release Date or subsequently acquired, without effectively securing the Notes (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of the Company ranking equally with the Notes) equally and ratably with the Debt (but only so long as the Debt is so secured).
     The foregoing restriction will not apply to:
     (i) Liens on any Operating Property existing at the time of its acquisition and not created in contemplation of the acquisition;
     (ii) Liens on Operating Property of a corporation existing at the time the corporation is merged into or consolidated with the Company, or at the time the corporation disposes of substantially all of its properties (or those of a division) to the Company, provided that the Lien is not extended to property owned by the Company immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or other disposition and is not created in contemplation of the merger, consolidation or other disposition;
     (iii) Liens on Operating Property to secure the cost of acquisition, construction, development or substantial repair, alteration or improvement of such property or to secure indebtedness incurred to provide funds for any of these purposes or for reimbursement of funds previously expended for any of these purposes, provided the Liens are created or assumed contemporaneously with, or within 18 months after, the acquisition or the completion of substantial repair or alteration, construction, development or substantial improvement or within 6 months thereafter pursuant to a commitment for financing arranged with a lender or investor within such 18-month period;
     (iv) Liens in favor of the United States or any state or any department, agency or instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States or any state, or for the benefit of holders of securities issued by any of these entities, to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of substantially repairing or altering, constructing, developing or substantially improving the Operating Property; or
     (v) Any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Lien referred to in the exceptions listed above, provided, however, that the principal amount of Debt secured thereby and not otherwise authorized by those exceptions listed above shall not exceed the principal amount of Debt,
 
plus any premium or fee payable in connection with any such extension, renewal or replacement, so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement.
     (b) In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, from and after the Release Date, the Company may issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a Lien which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions up to an aggregate amount which, together with all other of the Company's secured Debt (not including secured Debt permitted under any of the foregoing exceptions) and the Value of Sale and Lease-Back Transactions existing at such time (other than Sale and Lease-Back Transactions the proceeds of which have been applied to the retirement of certain indebtedness, Sale and Lease-Back Transactions in which the property involved would have been permitted to be subjected to a Lien under any of the foregoing exceptions, and Sale and Lease-Back Transactions that are permitted by the first sentence of Section 3.02 below), does not exceed the greater of 10% of the Company's Net Tangible Assets or 10% of the Company's Capitalization. The foregoing restrictions do not limit the Company's ability to place Liens on (i) the capital stock of any of the Company's subsidiaries or (ii) the assets of any of the Company's subsidiaries.
     SECTION 3.02. Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. So long as the Notes are outstanding from and after the Release Date, unless Substitute Mortgage Bonds are issued to secure the Notes, the Company may not enter into or permit to exist any Sale and Lease-Back Transaction with respect to any Operating Property (except for leases for a term, including any renewal or potential renewal, of not more than 48 months), if the purchaser's commitment is obtained more than 18 months after the later of the completion of the acquisition, construction or development of the Operating Property or the placing in operation of the Operating Property or of the Operating Property as constructed or developed or substantially repaired, altered or improved. This restriction will not apply if (a) the Company would be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a) above to issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist Debt secured by a Lien on the Operating Property without equally and ratably securing the Notes, (b) after giving effect to the Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, pursuant to Section 3.01(b) above, the Company could incur at least $1.00 of additional Debt secured by Liens (other than Liens permitted by clause (a)), or (c) the Company applies within 180 days an amount equal to, in the case of a sale or transfer for cash, the net proceeds (not less than the fair value of the Operating Property so leased), and, otherwise, an amount equal to the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the Operating Property so leased to the retirement of Notes or other Debt of the Company ranking equally with the Notes; provided, however, that any such retirement of Notes shall be in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture and the Notes; provided, further, that the amount to be applied to such retirement of Notes or other Debt shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (a) an amount equal to the redemption price with respect to Notes delivered within such one hundred eighty (180)-day period to the Trustee for retirement and cancellation and (b) the principal amount, plus any premium or fee paid in connection with any redemption in accordance with the terms of other Debt voluntarily retired by the Company within such one hundred eighty (180)-day period, excluding in each case retirements pursuant to mandatory sinking fund or prepayment provisions and payments at Stated Maturity.
     SECTION 3.03. Waiver. Section 1109 of the Original Indenture shall apply to the covenants set forth in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 above at any time such covenants are in effect.
 
     SECTION 4.01. Security. Subject to Section 4.02 below, as provided in and pursuant to Article Four of the Original Indenture, the Notes will be secured as to payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, by a series of Mortgage Bonds (the "General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, 2006 Series CT," the "Bonds," the "Bonds of the related series" or the "related series of Bonds") of the Company to be issued concurrently with the issuance of the Notes under and secured by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of October 1, 1924, between the Company and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as successor trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, including the supplemental indenture, dated as of December 1, 2006, creating the Bonds (collectively, the "Mortgage"), pledged by the Company for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes to the Trustee under this Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture. The Bonds shall be issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
     SECTION 4.02. Release. Until the Release Date and subject to Article Four of the Original Indenture, the Bonds of the related series issued and delivered to the Trustee shall serve as security for any and all obligations of the Company under all Notes from time to time Outstanding, including, but not limited to (1) the full and prompt payment of the principal and premium, if any, on the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, either at the Stated Maturity thereof, upon acceleration of the maturity thereof, upon redemption, or otherwise, and (2) the full and prompt payment of any interest on the Notes when and as the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Indenture or the Notes including, if and to the extent provided for in the Notes, interest on overdue installments of principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest on overdue installments of interest.
     Each supplemental indenture to the Mortgage pursuant to which any Bonds are issued shall contain a provision to the effect that any payment by the Company hereunder of principal of or premium or interest on Notes which shall have been authenticated and delivered in connection with the issuance and delivery to the Trustee of such Bonds (other than by the application of the proceeds of a payment in respect of such Bonds) shall to the extent thereof, be deemed to satisfy and discharge the obligation of the Company, if any, to make a payment of principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, in respect of such Bonds which is then due.
     Notwithstanding anything in the Original Indenture to the contrary, from and after the Release Date, the obligation of the Company to make payment with respect to the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds shall be deemed satisfied and discharged as provided in the supplemental indenture or indentures to the Mortgage creating such Bonds and the Bonds shall cease to secure in any manner Notes theretofore or subsequently issued; the Trustee shall thereupon surrender the Bonds to the Mortgage Trustee for cancellation and execute and deliver such proper instruments of release as may be required. From and after the Release Date, all Notes, whether theretofore or subsequently issued, shall, at the Company's option, either (i) become unsecured or (ii) be secured by Substitute Mortgage Bonds pursuant to Section 4.03 below, and any conditions to the issuance of Notes that refer or relate to Bonds or the Mortgage shall be inapplicable (except as such conditions shall be deemed to refer to Substitute Mortgage

Payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity or earlier redemption of such Securities shall be made at the office of the Paying Agent upon surrender of such Securities to the Paying Agent. Payments of interest shall be made, at the option of the Company, subject to such surrender where applicable, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.

     Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or a duly appointed Authentication Agent referred to herein, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to a Collateral Trust Indenture dated as of June 30, 1993 (the "Original Indenture") duly executed and delivered between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor Trustee (herein referred to as the "Trustee"), as supplemented through and including a Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 1, 2006 (together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the registered Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
     The Notes are not subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof and are not subject to any sinking fund, except to the extent that the Insurer, or its successor in interest, may have exercised its rights pursuant to Section 2.03 of the aforesaid Twenty-First Supplemental Indenture. The Notes are subject to Optional Redemption and Extraordinary Optional Redemption, as a whole or in part, and Special Optional Redemption, in whole, by the Company prior to Stated Maturity of the principal thereof upon the same terms as the 2006CT Bonds are subject to redemption. Upon payment of the principal or premium, if any, on the 2006CT Bonds, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise, or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Article IV or VIII of the Bond Indenture, or upon payment of interest on the 2006CT Bonds, Notes in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the 2006CT Bonds so paid, or interest on Notes in an amount equal to the interest on the 2006CT Bonds so paid, as the case may be, shall, to the extent of such payment, be deemed fully paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall forthwith cease and be discharged, and, in the case of the payment of principal and premium, if any, such Notes shall be surrendered for cancellation or presented for appropriate notation to the Trustee.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date.
     Notice of any Optional, Extraordinary Optional or Special Optional Redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Optional, Extraordinary Optional or
 
Special Optional Redemption Date, as the case may be, to the Holder hereof at its registered address.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption.
     If money sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the principal amount of and accrued interest on the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the related Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on or after such date, interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption.
     If the Company elects to redeem all or a portion of the Notes, the redemption will be conditional upon receipt by the Paying Agent or the Trustee of monies sufficient to pay the Redemption Price. If the Notes are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Notes are to be redeemed in a manner it deems fair and appropriate in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
     In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the registered Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Notes may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein. In the event the Company desires to provide for the payment of Notes, in lieu of defeasing the Notes in accordance with the Indenture, the Company shall either redeem an equal principal amount of 2006CT Bonds or take such action as shall be required by the Bond Indenture to defease an equal principal amount of 2006CT Bonds.
     Any amount payable by the Company in respect of principal of the Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise, in a circumstance where there has not been a corresponding payment of principal of 2006CT Bonds, shall be applied simultaneously to the redemption or defeasance of any equal principal amount of 2006CT Bonds in accordance with the Bond Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the registered Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of each series affected at the time, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the registered Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate of or extend the time of
 
payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the registered Holder of each Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the registered Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the registered Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting (i) the registered Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) the registered Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such registered Holder and upon all future registered Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
     Prior to the Release Date, the Notes of this series shall be secured by a series of Mortgage Bonds (the "Related Series of Bonds"), delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes. Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as Holder of the Related Series of Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Related Series of Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional Mortgage Bonds may be issued.
     FROM AND AFTER SUCH TIME AS ALL BONDS, OTHER THAN (1) PLEDGED BONDS, INCLUDING THE RELATED SERIES OF BONDS, AND (2) MORTGAGE BONDS (EXCLUSIVE OF PLEDGED BONDS) WHICH DO NOT IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT EXCEED THE GREATER OF FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF NET TANGIBLE ASSETS OR FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF CAPITALIZATION, HAVE BEEN RETIRED THROUGH PAYMENT, REDEMPTION OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING THOSE MORTGAGE BONDS THE PAYMENT FOR WHICH HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MORTGAGE) AT, BEFORE OR AFTER THE MATURITY THEREOF, PROVIDED THAT NO DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING (THE "RELEASE DATE"), THE RELATED SERIES OF BONDS SHALL CEASE TO SECURE THE NOTES IN ANY MANNER.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or any
 
transfer agent duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Note Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Note Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of this series a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
     All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Note to be duly executed and attested, all as of the day and year first above written.

     Section 4.1. . Simultaneously with the authorization of this Agreement by the governing body of the Issuer, the governing body of the Issuer has adopted the Bond Resolution and authorized the execution of the Indenture. The Company hereby approves the Bond Resolution and the Indenture. It is hereby agreed that the foregoing approval of the Bond Resolution and the Indenture constitutes the acknowledgement and agreement of the Company that the Bonds, when issued, sold and delivered as provided in the Bond Resolution and the Indenture, will be issued in accordance with and in compliance with this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other contract or agreement to the contrary. Any Owner is entitled to rely fully and unconditionally on the foregoing approval. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or any other contract or agreement to the contrary, the Company's approval of the Bond Resolution and the Indenture shall be the Company's agreement that all pledges, covenants and provisions in this Agreement and the Indenture affecting the Company shall, upon the delivery of the Bonds and the Indenture, become unconditional, valid and binding pledges, covenants and obligations of the Company so long as the Bonds and the interest thereon are outstanding and unpaid. Particularly, the obligation of the Company to pay, promptly when due, all Loan Payments specified in this Agreement and the Indenture shall be absolute and unconditional, and said obligation may be enforced as provided in this Agreement and the Indenture.
Company Approval of Issuance of Bonds
     Section 4.2. . After the issuance of any Bonds, the Issuer shall not refund any of the Bonds or change or modify the Bonds in any way, except as provided for in the Indenture, without the prior written approval of an Authorized Company Representative; nor shall the Issuer redeem any Bonds prior to the Maturity Date except upon the written request of an Authorized Company Representative, unless such redemption is required by the Indenture.
Refunding of Bonds
     Section 4.3. . The Issuer, upon the written request of the Company (and provided that the affected Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the Issuer, or the Company, and provided that such request is received in sufficient time prior to the date upon which such redemption is proposed), promptly shall take or cause to be taken all action that may be necessary under the applicable redemption provisions to effect such redemption prior to maturity, to the full extent of funds either made available for such purpose by the Company or already on deposit in the Bond Fund and available for such purpose. The redemption of any Outstanding Bonds prior to maturity at any time shall not relieve the
Redemption of Bonds
 
Company of its absolute and unconditional obligation to pay each remaining Loan Payment, with respect to any Outstanding Bonds, as specified in the Indenture. If a redemption of Bonds is required pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Company agrees as provided herein to promptly make Loan Payments sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds due on such redemption date.
     Section 4.4. . (a) To repay the loan, the Company hereby covenants and agrees to make the Loan Payments, as hereinafter provided in subsections (b), (c), (f) and (h) of this Section 4.4, to the Trustee, or the Paying Agent for the account of the Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer in accordance with this Agreement.
Loan Payments
     (b) The Company shall make Loan Payments, subject to the limitations of subsection (e) below of this Section 4.4, in immediately available funds directly to the Trustee or the Paying Agent for deposit in the Bond Fund on or before each day on which any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Bonds shall become due (whether at maturity or upon redemption or acceleration or otherwise) in an amount which, together with other money held by the Trustee under the Indenture and available therefor, will enable the Trustee to make such payment in full when due in accordance with the Indenture.
     (c) In the event the Company should fail to make any of the Loan Payments required in this Section, the Loan Payment so in default shall continue as an obligation of the Company until the amount in default shall have been fully paid, and the Company agrees to pay the same with interest thereon at the rate then borne by the Bonds, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below, from the date when such payment was due as provided in the Indenture.
     (d) If, subsequent to or on a date on which the Company is obligated to pay the Loan Payments (subject to provisions of Article VIII of the Indenture), losses (net of gains) shall be incurred in respect of any investments, or any other event has occurred causing the money in the Bond Fund, together with any other money then held by the Trustee and available for the purpose of the Bond Fund, to be less than the amount sufficient at the time of such occurrence or other event to pay, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, all amounts due and payable or to become due and payable, the Trustee shall notify the Company of such fact and thereafter the Company, as and when required for purposes of such Bond Fund, shall pay in immediately available funds to the Trustee for deposit in the Bond Fund the amount of any such reduction below such sufficient amount.
     (e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Bond Documents to the contrary, in no event (including without limitation the acceleration of maturity of the Bonds or the redemption of the Bonds pursuant to the Bond Documents) shall the amount of interest contracted for, charged, received, reserved or taken in connection with the loan made hereunder (together with any other costs or considerations that constitute interest under applicable law which are contracted for, charged, received, reserved or taken pursuant to the Bond Documents) (collectively, "Interest") exceed the amount of interest which could have been contracted for, charged, reserved, received or taken at the Maximum Interest Rate. This provision shall be held to operate to deny the Owners the right, in any event, to collect usury.
 
     (f) The Company further agrees that in the event payment of the principal of and the interest on the Bonds is accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, all amounts payable under Section 4.4(b) for the remainder of the term hereof (other than interest not yet due) shall be immediately due and payable.
     (g) Any amount held in the Bond Fund on any payment date specified in subsection (b) above shall be credited against the Loan Payments required to be made by the Company on such date.
     (h) The Company shall be obligated to prepay in whole or in part the amounts payable hereunder upon a Determination of Taxability (as defined below) giving rise to a mandatory redemption of the Bonds pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Indenture, by paying an amount equal to, when added to other funds on deposit in the Bond Fund, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed pursuant to the Indenture plus accrued interest to the redemption date.
     (i) The Company shall cause a mandatory redemption to occur within 180 days after a Determination of Taxability (as defined below) shall have occurred. A shall be deemed to have occurred if, as a result of the failure of the Company to observe any covenant, agreement or representation in this Agreement, an opinion of Bond Counsel obtained by the Company, or a final decree or judgment of any federal court or a final action of the Internal Revenue Service determines that interest paid or payable on any Bond is or will be includible in the gross income of an Owner of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes under the Code (other than an Owner who is a "substantial user" or "related person" within the meaning of Section 147(a) of the Code). However, no such decree or action will be considered final for this purpose unless the Company has been given written notice of the same, either directly or in the name of any Owner of a Bond, and, if it so desires and is legally allowed, has been afforded the opportunity to contest the same, either directly or in the name of any Owner of a Bond, and until conclusion of any appellate review, if sought. If the Trustee receives written notice from the Issuer or any Owner of a Bond stating (a) that the Issuer or the Owner has been notified in writing by the Internal Revenue Service that it proposes to include the interest on any Bond in the gross income of such Owner for the reasons described therein or any other proceeding has been instituted against the Issuer or such Owner which may lead to a final decree or action as described herein, and (b) that the Issuer or such Owner will afford the Company the opportunity to contest the same, either directly or in the name of the Issuer or the Owner, until a conclusion of any appellate review, if sought, then the Trustee shall promptly give notice thereof to the Company, the Issuer, the Provider, if any, and the Owner of each Bond then Outstanding. If a final decree or action as described above thereafter occurs and the Trustee has received written notice thereof, the Trustee promptly shall request prepayment from the Company of the amounts payable hereunder and give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the earliest practical date, but not later than the date specified in this Article, and in the manner provided by Section 4.05 of the Indenture.
"Determination of Taxability"
     At the time of any such prepayment of the amounts payable hereunder pursuant to this Section, the prepayment amount shall be applied, together with other available moneys in the Bond Fund, to the redemption of the Bonds on the date specified in the notice as provided in the Indenture, whether or not such date is an Interest Payment Date, to the Trustee's fees and
 
expenses under the Indenture accrued to such redemption of the Bonds, and to all sums due to the Issuer under this Agreement.
     Notwithstanding any provision herein or in the Insurance Agreement to the contrary, no payments of principal of or interest on the Bonds shall be due or paid by the Company hereunder to the extent that such amounts have been paid by or on behalf of the Municipal Bond Insurer pursuant to the Municipal Bond Insurance Policy and applied by the Trustee for such payment in accordance with the Indenture and the Company has provided sufficient funds for reimbursement to the Municipal Bond Insurer under the Insurance Agreement for such payment.
     Whenever any notice of prepayment of the amounts payable hereunder pursuant to this Article IV has been given, which includes a notice for redemption of the Bonds pursuant to the Indenture, all amounts payable under the first paragraph of this Section 4.4(i) shall become due and payable on the date fixed for redemption of such Bonds.
     Section 4.5. . (a) In addition to the amounts payable by the Company under Section 4.4, on or prior to each date on which the Paying Agent is required to disburse the purchase price for any Bond tendered or deemed tendered in accordance with Article III of the Indenture, the Company will pay or cause to be paid, as necessary, by the time and in the manner specified in the Indenture, to the extent remarketing proceeds are unavailable therefor, the purchase price of bonds tendered to the Paying Agent (as agent for the Owners) pursuant to Article III of the Indenture, in lawful money of the United States of America (as required by the Indenture), which will be held in trust for the benefit of the tendering Owners or Owners that are deemed to have been tendered in an amount which, together with any amounts available to the Paying Agent for said purpose, will be sufficient to pay the purchase price for all Bonds which are to be purchased on such date.
Purchase Price Payments of the Company
     (b) The Issuer shall have no obligation, financial or otherwise, with respect to payment of the purchase price of any Bonds required to be purchased pursuant to the Indenture, or for arrangements therefor, except that the Issuer shall generally cooperate with the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Remarketing Agent, as contemplated in the Indenture.
     Section 4.6. . The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, an amount equal to (i) the reasonable fees and charges of the Trustee for services rendered as Trustee under the Indenture and its reasonable expenses incurred as Trustee under the Indenture, including reasonable fees of its counsel, and (ii) the reasonable fees and charges of the Paying Agent and Registrar and the reasonable expenses incurred by the Paying Agent and the Registrar as and when the same become due, including the reasonable fees of their respective counsel.
Administrative Expenses
     Section 4.7. . The Company shall pay to the Issuer, upon receipt of statements therefor from time to time, such amounts as are necessary to pay or reimburse the Issuer for its reasonable and necessary expenses and costs attributable to the Bonds and the Project. In addition, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, as a condition to receiving the loan from the Issuer pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, pay to the Issuer an issuance fee in the amount of $98,125.00.
Payment of Other Costs of Issuer
     Section 4.8. . The obligations of the Company to make the payments required in Sections 3.1, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 7.1 and 9.3 and
Obligations of the Company Absolute and Unconditional
 
to perform and observe the other agreements on its part contained herein shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be subject to diminution by set-off, counterclaim, abatement or otherwise. Until payment of all principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, and payment in full of the purchase price of any Bonds purchased pursuant to the Indenture, and payment of all other amounts payable by the Company hereunder, the Company (a) will not suspend or discontinue any payments provided for in this Agreement, except to the extent the same have been prepaid, (b) will perform and observe all its other agreements contained herein, and (c) except as provided in Section 7.6, will not terminate this Agreement for any cause, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any acts or circumstances that may constitute failure of consideration, sale, loss, eviction or constructive eviction, destruction of or damage to the Project, commercial frustration of purpose, any change in the tax or other laws of the United States of America or of the State or any political subdivision of either, or any failure of the Issuer to perform and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or in connection herewith or with the Indenture. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to release the Issuer from the performance of any of the agreements on its part herein contained and in the event the Issuer shall fail to perform any such agreement on its part, the Company may take such action as the Company may deem necessary to perform or compel performance, provided that no such action shall violate the agreements on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement or postpone or diminish the amounts required to be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the issuance and delivery of the Bonds to the initial purchasers thereof, the Company shall have received, and the Issuer shall have given, full and complete consideration for the Company's obligation hereunder to make Loan Payments.
     Section 4.9. . The Company shall have, and is hereby granted, the option to prepay the amounts required to be paid by the Company under Section 4.4 in whole and to direct the Trustee to redeem the Bonds in whole if any of the events described in the Indenture permitting such redemption shall have occurred.

     (c) Less than 25% of the Bond proceeds are to be used directly or indirectly for the acquisition of land used for other than farming purposes, and no portion of the Bond proceeds is to be used, directly or indirectly, for the acquisition of land used for farming purposes (Code  144(a)(11) and 147(c) provide that interest with respect to any obligation issued as part of an issue will not be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes if any portion of the proceeds of such issue is to be used (directly or indirectly) for the acquisition of land (or an interest therein) to be used for farming purposes, or 25% or more of the proceeds of such issue is to be used (directly or indirectly) for the acquisition of land not used for farming purposes).
     (d) No portion of the Bond proceeds will be used for the acquisition of any property (or an interest therein) the first use of which property is not pursuant to such acquisition unless the rehabilitation requirements of Code  147(d)(2) are met with respect to the Project. (Code  147(d) provides that interest with respect to any obligation issued as part of an issue will not be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes if any portion of the proceeds of such issue is to be used for the acquisition of any property (or an interest therein) unless the first use of such property is pursuant to such acquisition, or unless certain rehabilitation requirements are met).
     (e) Except as is permitted by Code  149(b), the Bonds are not federally guaranteed within the meaning of those provisions. (Code  149(b) provides that interest on an obligation will not be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes if such obligation is federally guaranteed as provided therein).
     (f) The reasonably expected economic life of the Project financed with the proceeds of the Bonds is not less than thirty years.
 
     (g) Substantially all (i.e. 95%) of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to finance "solid waste disposal facilities" within the meaning of Section 142(a)(6) of the Code. The Company will comply fully during the term of this Agreement with all effective rules, rulings or regulations promulgated by the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, with respect to obligations substantially all of the proceeds of which are to be used to provide "solid waste disposal facilities", the interest on which is exempt from federal income taxation including, but not limited to, future regulations regarding the Bonds.
     (h) The Company hereby certifies that all or a major portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used directly or indirectly in the trade or business of the Company, and the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds, under the terms of the Bonds, is, in whole or in major part, secured by an interest in property used or to be used in the trade or business of the Company or in payments in respect of such property, or to be derived from payments in respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used in the trade or business of the Company.
     (i) In accordance with Section 147(b) of the Code, the average maturity of the Bonds does not exceed 120% of the average reasonably expected economic life of the facilities being financed by the Bonds.
     (j) The Company covenants and represents that it has not taken, or permitted to be taken on its behalf, or failed to take and agrees that it will not take, or permit to be taken on its behalf, or fail to take any action which, if taken or omitted to be taken, would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest paid on the Bonds and that it will take, or require to be taken, such acts as may from time to time be required under applicable law or regulation to preserve the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on the Bonds, except to the extent that the Bonds are held by a substantial user of the Project or a related person thereto as those terms are used in Section 147 of the Code. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company also agrees on behalf of the Issuer to comply with all arbitrage rebate requirements and procedures as may become applicable to the Bonds.
     (k) Other than the Bonds, there are no other Tax-Exempt obligations issued for the benefit of the Company or any "related person" which were or are to be sold (a) within 15 days of the Closing Date, (b) pursuant to the same plan of financing as the Bonds, and (c) payable from the same source of funds as the Bonds.
     (l) The Company agrees to follow the remedial action requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.142-2 or any successor regulation with respect to any actions which cause the Bonds not to meet the requirements of Section 142(a)(6) of the Code (such Section requires that substantially all of the proceeds of the obligations qualifying thereunder must be used for solid waste disposal facilities). Any proceeds received upon the sale or other disposition of any of the property which is included in the Project or constitutes property financed with the proceeds of the Bonds will be invested at a yield not greater than the yield on the Bonds, as defined in Exhibit A to the Tax Certificate of the Company, and used as required by Treas. Reg.  1.142-2, unless in the opinion of Bond
 
Counsel some other use of such proceeds will not impair the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the Bonds.

of 90 days after receipt of written notice specifying such failure and requesting that it be remedied, given to the Company by the Issuer, the Municipal Bond Insurer (unless a Municipal Bond Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing) or the Trustee; , that if said failure shall be such that it cannot be corrected within such period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if the failure, in the judgment of the Trustee in reliance upon advice of counsel, is correctable without material adverse effect on the Bonds and if corrective action is instituted by the Company within such period and diligently pursued until corrected.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture pursuant to the terms of which the Trustee shall have declared the Bonds immediately due and payable, then all payments required to be made by the Company under Section 4.4(b) (other than interest not yet accrued) shall become immediately due and payable, as directed by the Municipal Bond Insurer (unless a Municipal Bond Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing).
     (d) Any amounts collected pursuant to actions taken under this Section 9.1 shall be paid into the Bond Fund and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default, omission, or failure of performance hereunder shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In the event any provision contained in this Agreement should be breached by the Company and thereafter duly waived, such waiver shall be limited to the particular breach so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other breach of this Agreement.

The requirement that any Force Majeure shall be reasonably beyond the control of the party shall be deemed to be fulfilled even though any existing or impending strike, lockout or other industrial disturbance may not be settled but could have been settled by acceding to the demand of the opposing person or persons. The occurrence of any Force Majeure shall not suspend or otherwise abate, and the Company shall not be relieved from, the obligation to pay the Loan Payments and to pay any other payments required to be made by it under this Agreement at the times required.
