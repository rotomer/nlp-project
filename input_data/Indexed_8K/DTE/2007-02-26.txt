Exhibit 99.1
Feb. 26, 2007
DTE Energy announces strong 2006 operating earnings
     DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported 2006 earnings of $433 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, compared with reported earnings of $537 million, or $3.05 per diluted share in 2005. Reported earnings declined from 2005 primarily due to reduced synthetic fuel production and associated accounting reserves. Additionally, restructuring of non-utility businesses resulted in one-time impairments related to peaking plants, waste coal recovery and biomass operations.
     The company had 2006 operating earnings of $593 million, or $3.33 per diluted share, compared with 2005 operating earnings of $577 million, or $3.28 per diluted share. Operating results exclude non-recurring items, certain timing-related items and discontinued operations.
     Excluding synthetic fuels, 2006 operating earnings were $2.89 per diluted share, above the company's prior guidance of $2.52 to $2.63 per diluted share primarily due to better than expected performance at Detroit Edison and Energy Trading. Reconciliations of reported to operating earnings for both the quarter ended and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, are at the end of this news release.
     DTE Energy also reported cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion in 2006, a 50 percent increase over the $1 billion reported in 2005.
     "I'm pleased with our accomplishments in 2006," said Anthony F. Earley Jr., DTE Energy chairman and CEO. "Our robust cash flow enabled a dividend increase, and we worked hard to produce strong results in our utilities. Both customers and shareholders are benefiting from our investments in improving utility service and safety while at the same time reducing our operating costs through our comprehensive Performance Excellence Process.
     "In addition, our non-utility restructuring is proceeding as planned and we expect to generate more than $1 billion of cash flow in 2007 as we harvest some of the value we have created in our Unconventional Gas, Power and Industrial Projects and other non-utility businesses," Earley continued. "Overall, I expect our utility and non-utility strategies to continue to produce sustainable long-term earnings growth and cash flow."
 
Operating earnings and other results for 2006, by segment:
     Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $2.03 per diluted share versus $1.54 in 2005. The primary earnings driver was higher gross margins due to the expiration of the cap on residential rates in 2006 and customers returning to full utility service. Partially offsetting these improved results was milder weather in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2006 Detroit Edison invested $230 million in environmental projects to produce cleaner air and water and $741 million on other power generation, distribution system and technology improvements to improve reliability and efficiency.
Electric Utility:
     Primarily consisting of MichCon, this segment had operating earnings of $0.36 per diluted share compared with $0.42 in 2005. Lower sales due to milder weather and conservation were the main factors impacting year-over-year earnings. These impacts were partially offset by improved gas storage margins, a full year of higher rates from the April 2005 rate order, and lower operating and maintenance expense. MichCon invested $157 million in 2006 for improvements designed to benefit customers, including gas storage additions and a gas distribution system expansion to meet growing demand in western Michigan.
Gas Utility:
     This segment had operating earnings of $0.29 per diluted share compared with $0.26 in 2005. Driving earnings higher were higher non-utility gas storage margins and increased coal marketing activity.
Coal and Gas Midstream:
     Operating earnings for this segment increased to $0.05 per diluted share compared with $0.02 in 2005, primarily due to higher production from the Barnett shale and the continued repricing of Antrim shale gas production as low-priced legacy contracts expire. Offsetting these revenue increases were commensurate increases in operating and depletion expenses associated with higher production and the operation of new wells.
Unconventional Gas Production:
     DTE Energy drilled 142 wells and produced 22 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent (Bcfe) in its Antrim shale properties in Michigan in 2006. In its Barnett shale properties in Texas, the company successfully drilled 64 wells and produced 4.1 Bcfe in 2006.
     Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the synthetic fuel business has been shown as its own segment instead of being included in the Power and Industrial Projects segment. Power and Industrial Projects had an operating loss of $0.04 per diluted share compared with earnings of $0.02 in 2005. Key earnings drivers were improved coke battery performance offset by biomass underperformance.
Power and Industrial Projects:
     In 2006, DTE Energy recorded asset impairment charges of $0.40 per diluted share in this segment, primarily at its Crete and River Rouge peaking assets; these charges are excluded from operating earnings. The company is exploring options to remove the quarterly earnings drag resulting from its peaking plants including asset sales of remaining units.
     This segment had operating earnings of $0.54 per diluted share compared with an operating loss of $0.25 in 2005. Driving earnings higher were increased trading activity and the flowback of timing-related losses incurred in 2005.
Energy Trading:
 
     This segment had operating earnings of $0.44 per diluted share versus $1.56 in 2005. This decline was driven by the temporary idling of synthetic fuel plants and the partial phase out of production tax credits along with associated impairments, reserves and deferrals of potential gains from selling interests in the plants in 2006. The company has hedged its exposure to operating losses from oil price-related production tax credit phase out in 2007, and therefore expects to produce synthetic fuel at full capacity in 2007.
Synthetic Fuel:
     This segment had an operating loss of $0.34 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $0.29 in 2005, primarily due to tax benefits received in 2005 and a contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation in 2006.
Corporate and Other:
Fourth quarter 2006 operating earnings results, by segment:
     For the fourth quarter of 2006, DTE Energy had reported earnings of $142 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared with $382 million, or $2.14 per diluted share in 2005. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2006 were $167 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared with $378 million, or $2.12 per diluted share in 2005. Reported and operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 were higher primarily due to the realization of earnings from synthetic fuel production that had been deferred for the first three quarters of 2005.
     Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $0.39 per diluted share versus $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2005. Driving performance in 2006 was mild weather and a contribution to the DTE Energy Foundation, partially offset by more customers on full utility service compared with 2005.
Electric Utility:
     MichCon had operating earnings of $0.20 per diluted share versus $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The key driver of this decline was lower gas usage due to mild weather in 2006.
Gas Utility:
     Operating earnings from non-utility operations were $0.44 per diluted share versus $1.60 in the fourth quarter of 2005. The higher 2005 earnings resulted from the recognition of synfuel earnings deferred from the first three quarters of 2005, as well as the flowback of timing-related accounting adjustments in the Energy Trading segment. Earnings from Unconventional Gas Production increased to $0.03 per diluted share from breakeven results in the fourth quarter of 2005 due primarily to higher gas production from the company's Barnett shale properties.
Non-Utility Operations:
     The Corporate and Other segment had operating losses of $0.10 per diluted share compared with losses of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2005. Driving the improvement was lower interest expense and taxes.
Corporate and Other:
Outlook for 2007
     DTE Energy reiterated its 2007 operating earnings guidance excluding synthetic fuel of $2.60 to $2.80 per diluted share. Synthetic fuel is expected to add operating earnings of $0.60 to $1.25 per diluted share in 2007.
 
     "In 2007 we expect to continue to earn our authorized returns at Detroit Edison and MichCon," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "As we complete portions of our non-utility restructuring, we will provide updates to our non-utility earnings outlook."

     Use of Operating Earnings Information  DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
     In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2007 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2007 reported results will be excluded from operating results. A reconciliation to the comparable 2007 reported earnings guidance is not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
