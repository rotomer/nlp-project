Long-Term Incentive Plan
On June 25, 2008, the Organization and Compensation Committee ("Committee") of the DTE Energy Company ("Company") Board of Directors approved a revised shareholder return component to the performance measures and targets for the 2006 and 2007 awards made to executive officers under the Company's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively the "LTIP"). The shareholder return component will now measure total shareholder return vs. shareholder return of peer group companies. This revision conforms the outstanding 2006 and 2007 awards with the shareholder return component methodology utilized in the 2008 awards, measuring performance against peer group companies approved by the Committee that are engaged in businesses that correspond to the businesses in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged. Previously, the shareholder return component had measured total shareholder return vs. shareholder return of the companies in the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
