Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
(b) On October 21, 2008, DTE Energy Company ("DTE") and The Detroit Edison Company ("Detroit Edison"), at the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of DTE, engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as DTE's and Detroit Edison's independent registered public accounting firm beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009.
     During DTE's and Detroit Edison's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and from January 1, 2008 through October 21, 2008, neither DTE nor Detroit Edison, nor anyone on their behalf, consulted PwC regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the financial statements of DTE or Detroit Edison, and no written report or oral advice was provided to DTE or Detroit Edison that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by DTE or Detroit Edison in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively.
     Information regarding the dismissal of DTE's and Detroit Edison's previous independent registered public accounting firm was previously disclosed in a Form 8-K dated September 25, 2008 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 1, 2008.
