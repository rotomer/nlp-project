Exhibit 99.1
Summary of Detroit Edison's Electric Rate Order (Case U-15244)
1
December 29, 2008
On December 23, 2008, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued an order in Detroit Edison's rate case. The full text of the order can be found on the MPSC website at: http://efile.mpsc.cis.state.mi.us/efile/viewcase.php?casenum=15244&submit.x=32&submit.y=18
The MPSC order authorizes Detroit Edison to raise its rates by $83.6 million. In addition, the MPSC ordered Detroit Edison to implement a revenue neutral rate change before year-end to partially deskew its rates consistent with state legislation (Public Act 286) approved in October 2008. The purpose of the deskew is to align various customers' rates with the actual cost to serve.
The average rate increase for all classes of customers is approximately 2%; however, various rate classes were impacted differently. For a typical residential customer using 500 kWh per month, the impact of the rate increase (including the partial deskew adjustment) is approximately $2.50 per month or a 4.5% increase. Due in large part to the rate adjustment related to the deskew, Detroit Edison's small business customers will see a rate decrease of 1.6% on average, and large business customers will experience an average 1% increase.
