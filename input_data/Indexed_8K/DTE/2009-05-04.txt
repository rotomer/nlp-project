If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status, Level II Status or Level III Status and (ii) the Borrower's Moody's Rating is Baa3 or better the Borrower's S&P Rating is BBB- or better.
or
          "Level V Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status or Level IV Status.
          "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by Moody's and then in effect with respect to the Borrower's senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement.
          "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by S&P and then in effect with respect to the Borrower's senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement.
          "Status" means Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status or Level V Status.
 
          The Applicable Margin and Applicable Percentage shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on the Borrower's Status as determined from its then-current Moody's and S&P Ratings. The credit rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such date. If at any time the Borrower does not have both a Moody's Rating and an S&P Rating, Level V Status shall exist; , , that if the credit rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Schedule to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the applicable Status for the Borrower shall be the Borrower's Status most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
provided
however
          Except as specifically provided above in this Schedule, in the event that a split occurs between the two ratings, the pricing shall be based upon (x) the higher of the two ratings then applicable if all such ratings shall be in Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status or Level IV Status and (y) the lower of the two ratings if any of such ratings shall be in Level V Status. However, if (x) the split is greater than one level and the lowest rating shall be in Level III Status or Level IV Status, then the pricing shall be based upon the rating one level above the lower of the two ratings and (y) the split is greater than one level and the lowest rating shall be in Level V Status, then pricing shall be based upon Level V Status.

EXHIBIT E-1  FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE BORROWER
To each of the Lenders party to the Credit Agreement defined below The Detroit Edison Company
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(v) of the Two-Year Credit Agreement (the ""), dated as of April 29, 2009, among The Detroit Edison Company (the ""), the financial institutions from time to time parties thereto as "Lenders" and Barclays Bank PLC (the ""), as agent for said Lenders. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Credit Agreement
Borrower
Agent
          I am the General Counsel of the Borrower, and have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents.
          In that connection, I, in conjunction with the members of my staff, have examined:
     (i) Each Loan Document, executed by each of the parties thereto.
     (ii) The other documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Article III of the Credit Agreement.
     (iii) The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
Charter
     (iv) The Bylaws of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "").
Bylaws
     (v) A certificate from the State of Michigan attesting to the continued corporate existence and good standing of the Borrower.
In addition, I have examined the originals or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Borrower, and agreements, instruments and other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below. As to questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established by me, relied upon certificates of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Lenders and the Agent.
          My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the State of Michigan and the federal law of the United States.
 
          Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:
          1. The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan.
          2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene (i) the Charter or the Bylaws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower, or (iii) any contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower.
          3. No consent, authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery, recordation, filing or performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, except the order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has been obtained.
          4. The Credit Agreement has been, and each of the Notes when delivered will have been, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
          5. Except as may have been disclosed to you in the SEC Reports, to the best of my knowledge (after due inquiry) there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings affecting the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (i) could be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) purport to affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of any Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
          6. In a properly presented case, a Michigan court or a federal court sitting in the State of Michigan applying Michigan choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents and should hold that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Michigan. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by their terms the Loan Documents expressly select New York law as the laws governing their interpretation and that the Loan Documents governed by New York law were delivered by the parties thereto to the Agent in New York. The choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents are not voidable under the laws of the State of Michigan.
          7. If, despite the provisions of Section 8.09 of the Credit Agreement, wherein the parties thereto agree that the Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, a court of the State of Michigan or a federal court sitting in the State of Michigan were to hold that the Loan Documents are governed by, and to be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, the Loan Documents would be, under the laws of the State of Michigan, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
          8. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company," or an "affiliated person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
 
          The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications:
     (a) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or laws affecting creditors' rights generally.
     (b) My opinion in paragraph 7 above as to enforceability is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     (c) I express no opinion as to participation and the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Michigan wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Loan Documents may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.
          I am a member of the Bar of the State of Michigan, and do not express any opinion concerning any law other than the law of the State of Michigan and the federal laws of the United States of America.
          This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by any other person or entity without my prior written consent (provided, that this opinion letter may be furnished to and relied upon by a subsequent assignee of, or participant under, the Credit Agreement and a Note, if any, solely for the purpose of such assignment or participation, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications, set forth herein, without any prior written consent). I undertake no duty to inform you or any assignee or participant of events occurring subsequent to the date hereof.
Very truly yours,

          We have acted as special counsel to the Borrowers in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreements.
          In connection with this opinion we have examined a copy of each Credit Agreement signed by each of the parties thereto. We have also examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, instruments and other documents and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Borrowers. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the representations made in the Credit Agreements.
 
          In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We have assumed without independent investigation that (a) the Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Borrowers, (b) the Borrowers have been duly incorporated and are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their jurisdictions of incorporation and have the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform their obligations under the Loan Documents, (c) the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents by each Borrower party thereto (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on their part, (ii) do not contravene their certificates of incorporation or by-laws or, except as opined upon in paragraph 2 below, violate, or require any consent not obtained under, any applicable law or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other Governmental Authority binding upon any of them and (iii) do not violate, or require any consent not obtained under, any contractual obligation applicable to or binding upon any of them, and (d) the Credit Agreements constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the applicable Agent and the applicable Lenders.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and comments set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
     1. Each of the Credit Agreements is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower party thereto, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its respective terms. Each of the respective Notes issued on the date hereof, if any, is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the issuing Borrower, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Borrowers of the Loan Documents to which it is a party will not violate any Federal or New York statute or any rule or regulation issued pursuant to any Federal or New York statute.
          Our opinion in paragraph 1 above is subject to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
          We express no opinion with respect to: (a) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents that is intended (i) to establish any standard as the measure of the performance by any party thereto of such party's obligations of good faith, diligence, fair dealing, reasonableness or care or (ii) to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing signed by the parties thereto; (b) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law; (c) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents imposing penalties or forfeitures; (d) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with
 
violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution; (e) any provision of the Loan Documents which purports to provide for a waiver by the Borrowers of any immunity, defense or right which may be available to the Borrowers; and (f) any provision of the Loan Documents which purports to establish an evidentiary standard for determinations by any Person.
          In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreements whereby the Borrowers submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1332 on subject matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreements that relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510, a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one Federal court to another.
          We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion concerning any law other than Federal law and the law of the State of New York.
          This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by any other person or entity without our prior written consent (provided, that this opinion Letter may be furnished to and relied upon by a subsequent assignee of, or participant under, the Credit Agreements and a Note, if any, solely for the purpose of such assignment or participation, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein without our prior written consent). This opinion letter speaks only as of its date, there is no assurance that it will be correct as of any date after its date, and we undertake no duty to inform you or any assignee or participant of events occurring subsequent to the date hereof.
