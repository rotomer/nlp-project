Exhibit 1.1
May 6, 2009
To the Representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     DTE Energy Company, a Michigan corporation (the "Company") proposes to issue and sell severally to the firms named in Schedule I hereto (such firms constituting the "Underwriters") $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2009 Series A 7.625% Senior Notes due 2014 with the terms specified in Schedule II hereto (the "Securities"). The Securities will be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2001, as supplemented, and as to be supplemented by a Supplemental Indenture establishing the Securities (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., (successor to The Bank of New York), as Indenture Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee").
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the time and place and at the purchase price to the Underwriters set forth in Schedule II hereto, the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto. The sale of the Securities will be made to the Underwriters, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in Schedule II hereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement shall be several and not joint.
     2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters, on and as of the date hereof and the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4) that:
          (a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-136815) with respect to the Securities and other securities, copies of which have been delivered to the Underwriters, has been prepared and filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). Such registration statement, including a prospectus, became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") immediately upon filing and no stop order suspending its effectiveness and/or notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering has been initiated or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The term "Registration Statement," at any given time, means such registration statement, including any amendments thereto and any prospectus relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and deemed part of such Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act at such time. Each date the Registration Statement or any amendment (or any part thereof) is considered to have become effective as to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 11(d) of the Act and Rule 430B(f) promulgated thereunder
 
is herein called the "Effective Date." The base prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and certain other issues of securities (exclusive of any supplement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act) is herein called the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus as amended and supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated May 6, 2009 relating to the Securities immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Prospectus." The Company proposes to file together with the Basic Prospectus and pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a final prospectus supplement specifically related to the Securities and reflecting the terms of the Securities and plan of distribution arising from this Agreement (herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement") and has previously advised the Underwriters of all the information to be set forth therein. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the Final Prospectus Supplement, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424.
     Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein, or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, and filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as applicable; any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include, without limitation, the filing of any document under the Exchange Act deemed to be incorporated therein by reference after the date of such Registration Statement, Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus.
     For purposes of this Agreement, the "Applicable Time" is 1:46 p.m. (New York time) on the date of this Agreement; the documents listed on Schedule V hereto, taken together, are collectively referred to as the "Pricing Disclosure Package".
          (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
          (c) The Registration Statement, the Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus conform, and any further amendments or supplements thereto will conform, in all material respects, to the requirements of the Act and the Trust
 
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (A) the Registration Statement does not, and as of each Effective Date and the effective date of any amendment thereto will not, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, (B) the Pricing Disclosure Package did not, as of the Applicable Time, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and (C) the Prospectus, as of its date, does not, and as of the respective dates of any amendment or supplement thereto and at the Time of Delivery, will not, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; that this representation and warranty shall not apply to (i) any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or (ii) those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Forms T-1;

     3. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule II hereto and contemplated by this Agreement and the Pricing Disclosure Package.
     4. The Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement, in fully registered global form registered in the name of Cede & Co., shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment therefor by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor, all at the place, time and date specified in Schedule II hereto or at such other place, time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time, date and place being herein called the "Time of Delivery".
     5.

          (b) The Company agrees to prepare a term sheet specifying the terms of the Securities, substantially in the form of Schedule V hereto and approved by the Representatives,
 
and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time period prescribed by such Rule;
          (c) The Company and the Representatives have complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any free writing prospectus, including timely Commission filing where required and legending;
          (d) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which (i) such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus or (ii) the Pricing Disclosure Package would contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter a free writing prospectus or other document, the use of which has been consented to by the Representatives, which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.
     6. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters:
          (a) To prepare the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus in relation to the Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery hereof, or if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus after the date hereof and prior to the Time of Delivery unless the Company has furnished the Representatives for such Securities with a copy for their review and comment a reasonable time period prior to filing and has reasonably considered any comments of the Representatives; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after the Time of Delivery and to furnish the Representatives with copies thereof in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of (i) the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, (ii) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or any notice objecting to its use, (iii) the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, (iv) the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or (v) any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or Prospectus or for additional information (including receipt of any comments of the Commission on any of the foregoing); and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any
 
such qualification, to promptly use every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of such order;
          (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply, so far as it is able, with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a securities dealer or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or to comply with any other requirements deemed by the Company to be unduly burdensome;
          (c) Prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented in New York City in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;
          (d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); and
          (e) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the Time of Delivery, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after the Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to the Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives.
     7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other reasonable expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and

as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
          (c) Patrick B. Carey, Esq., Associate General Counsel or Bruce D. Peterson, Esq., Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives a written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
          (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
          (iii) Each Significant Subsidiary, if any, of the Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the power and authority (corporate and other) to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, except as described in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, each Significant Subsidiary of the Company holds all licenses, certificates and permits (or has applications pending) from governmental authorities necessary for the conduct of its business except where such failure to hold necessary licenses, certificates or permits would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
          (iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge after due inquiry and other than as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
 
          (v) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
          (vi) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and (2) general equity principles; the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indenture conforms in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (vii) The Securities have been duly authorized and established in conformity with the provisions of the Indenture and executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture and enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (1) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and (2) general equity principles; and the Securities conform in all material respects to the description thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (viii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not (1) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel after due inquiry, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the properties or assets of the Company is subject, or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, except (i) that such counsel need express no opinion as to rights to indemnity which may be limited by applicable law, and (ii) any such conflict, breach, violation or default that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency (including, without limitation, the Michigan Public Service Commission ("PSC")) or any other body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities by the Company or execution, delivery, performance and consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Securities or the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;
 
          (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of its Bylaws or articles of incorporation or except for any default which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound;
          (x) The statements set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented under the captions, "Description of Debt Securities", "Description of Notes" (or similar captions), insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and, if applicable, under the caption "Taxation" (or similar caption), and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein (except for any statements made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus), are accurate and fair summaries in all material respects;
          (xi) The Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be, an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
          (xii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein and except for those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and, although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in such documents, such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
          (xiii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filings of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, have been made in the manner and within the time period required
 
by Rule 424(b); to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the Act; the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (x) of this Section 8(c), such counsel has no reason to believe that (A) as of each applicable Effective Date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto (including the filing of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission) made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) as of the Applicable Time, the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) as of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein and that portion of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Forms T-1, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and
          (xiv) such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;
 
          (d) On each of the date hereof and at the Time of Delivery, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent accountants of the Company who have audited the audited financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated such date, with respect to such financial statements and other matters requested by the Representatives, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives. On each of the date hereof and at the Time of Delivery, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC") shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter with respect to such matters requested by the Representatives, each in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, the first dated the date hereof and the second dated the Time of Delivery reaffirming the statements made in their letter dated the date hereof. The specified date referred to in the PWC letter delivered on the date hereof shall be a date not more than three business days prior to the date hereof and the specified date referred to in the PWC letter delivered at the Time of Delivery shall be a date not more than three business days prior to such Time of Delivery.
          (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change (other than such as may have occurred in the ordinary course of business) in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended prior to the date hereof, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus as amended or supplemented;
          (f) At the Time of Delivery, the Securities shall be rated at least "Baa2" (stable outlook) by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., "BBB-" (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and "BBB" (negative outlook) by Fitch Ratings and the Company shall have delivered to the Underwriters a letter from each such rating agency, or other evidence satisfactory to the Underwriters, confirming that the Securities have such ratings on such date;
          (g) On or after the date hereof (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under
 
surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or otherwise given any notice of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change;
          (h) On or after the date hereof there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading of any securities of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal, or New York State authorities, (iv) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other crisis or calamity, or (v) any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States, if the effect of any such event specified in clauses (iv) and (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus;
          (i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the business day next succeeding the date hereof; and
          (j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a), (f) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, any free writing prospectus used by the Company other than a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or any
provided, however,
 
such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein or with respect to any statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement that shall constitute the Statements of Eligibility and Qualification under the Trust Indenture Act of the Indenture Trustee.
          (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its directors, officers, employees, and agents and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by each such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, selected counsel may be counsel to the indemnifying party, unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of separate counsel for the indemnified party or (ii) in the opinion of counsel to such indemnified party, representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or likely conflicts of interest between them or defenses available to the indemnified party which are different from, additional to or in competition with those available to the indemnifying party, in either of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel (including disbursements) for such indemnified party shall be reimbursed
 
by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any litigation or proceeding or related litigation or proceedings in the same jurisdiction as to which the indemnified parties are entitled to such separate representation, be liable under this Agreement for the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses for more than one separate firm (together with not more than one appropriate local counsel) for all such indemnified parties.
          (d) In furtherance of the requirement above that fees and expenses of counsel (to the extent the indemnifying party does not assume the defense) or any separate counsel for the indemnified parties shall be reasonable, the Underwriters and the Company agree that the indemnifying party's obligations to pay such fees and expenses shall be conditioned upon the following:
          (i) in case separate counsel is proposed to be retained by the indemnified parties pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, the indemnified parties shall, if appropriate, in good faith fully consult with the indemnifying party in advance as to the selection of such counsel; and
          (ii) reimbursable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be detailed and supported in a manner reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party (but nothing herein shall be deemed to require the furnishing to the indemnifying party of any information, including, without limitation, computer print-outs of lawyers' daily time entries, to the extent that, in the judgment of such counsel, furnishing such information might reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege) and presented to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable following receipt of such counsel's invoice.
No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified parties, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party or parties is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party or parties from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party or parties.
     The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees, subject to the provisions of this Section 9, to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss, damage, liability or expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment.
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
 
party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above and the indemnifying party has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the
 
Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, to be purchased at the Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters (and approved in writing by the Representatives) in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of Securities, but the Company shall not then be under further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Securities except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in this Agreement.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in Schedule II hereto; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     14.

     NOW, THEREFORE, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSETH that, in order to establish the terms of a series of debt securities, and for and in consideration of the premises and of the covenants contained in the Original Indenture and in this Supplemental Indenture and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is mutually covenanted and agreed as follows:

     SECTION 205. .
Terms of the Notes
     (a) The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 7.625% per annum on the principal amount thereof from May 13, 2009, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal of the Notes becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum during such overdue period. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing November 15, 2009. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year.
     (b) In the event that any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or other date of Maturity of the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the amount payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date with respect to any Note will, as provided in the Original Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in said Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the relevant record date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (the "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the person in whose name the Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of the Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture. The principal of, and premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date at such address as shall appear in the Security Register.
     (c) The Notes are not subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof and are not subject to any sinking fund.

     (d) The Notes shall have such other terms and provisions as are set forth in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A (which is incorporated by reference in and made a part of this Supplemental Indenture as if set forth in full at this place).

EXHIBIT A
THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL NOTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITARY. UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN CERTIFICATED FORM, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY ("DTC"), TO A NOMINEE OF DTC OR BY DTC OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR OF DTC OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR. UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY NOTE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO., OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL, INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
     DTE ENERGY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Michigan (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of $300,000,000 on May 15, 2014 ("Stated Maturity" with respect to the principal of this Note), unless previously redeemed, and to pay interest at the rate of 7.625% per annum on said principal sum from May 13 2009, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal of this Note becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum during such overdue period. Interest on this Note will be payable semiannually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing November 15, 2009. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year.
     In the event that any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or other date of Maturity of the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the amount payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. A "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which
 
commercial banks in The City of New York are required or authorized by law or executive order to be closed. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the relevant record date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (the "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of the Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of, and premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if this Note is a Global Note and is held in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depositary, payments on this Note will be made to the Depositary or its nominee in accordance with arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and the Depositary.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company, designated as the "2009 Series A 7.625% Senior Notes due 2014" (the "Notes"), initially limited to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of other Notes, and except as further provided in the Indenture), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2001, as supplemented through and including the Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 2009 (together, as amended, supplemented or modified, the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (herein referred to as the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the registered Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
     This Note is not subject to repayment at the option of the Holder hereof. This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
     This Note will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (any such date of optional redemption, an "Optional Redemption Date," which shall be a "Redemption Date" for purposes of the Indenture), at an optional redemption price (which shall be a "Redemption Price" for purposes of the Indenture) equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present
 
values of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed and the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the related Optional Redemption Date) until Stated Maturity, in each case discounted from their respective scheduled payment dates to such Optional Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, plus in either case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on this Note that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date.
     "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date, using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Optional Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Note that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity with the remaining term of this Note.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Optional Redemption Date, (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Optional Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of: (i) Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective affiliates which are Primary Treasury Dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Optional Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Optional Redemption Date.
     Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Optional Redemption Date to the Holder hereof at its registered address.
 
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the applicable Redemption Price, on and after the applicable Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption.
     If money sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the principal amount of and accrued interest on the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the related Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on or after such Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption. If the Notes are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Notes are to be redeemed by lot or in a manner it deems fair and appropriate in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
     In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the registered Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes issued under the Indenture at the time outstanding and affected thereby; provided, however, that no such amendment shall without the consent of the Holder of each Note so affected, among other things (i) change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on any Notes, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof or (ii) reduce the percentage of Notes, the Holders of which are required to consent to any amendment or waiver or for certain other matters as set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting (i) the registered Holders of 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) the registered Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the registered Holders of the Securities, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such registered Holder and upon all future registered Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
     Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
     The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. This Global Note is exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture. The Notes so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of the Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the registered Holder surrendering the same.
     As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no registered owner of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such registered owner shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (ii) the registered owners of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the registered owners of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the registered owner hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
     Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or a duly appointed Authentication Agent referred to herein, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
     The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
