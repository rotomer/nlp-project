Exhibit 99.1
Summary of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company's Rate Case Filing U-15985
1
June 10, 2009
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon) filed a general rate case yesterday with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). This document provides a summary of MichCon's filing. The full testimony of the filing will be available on the MPSC's website (http://efile.mpsc.cis.state.mi.us/efile/) under case number U-15985.
This case requests the first increase for delivery rates since 2005. MichCon's strong focus on cost controls and developing other revenue sources have forestalled the need for a rate increase for nearly five years. The average annual bill, including the requested rate increase, is expected to be 20-25% below 2005 levels and 5% lower than last year. Customers are benefiting from our investments in energy efficiency education programs as well as lower natural gas prices.
Consistent with Michigan's Public Act 286 of 2008, and the settlement in MichCon's last base gas sale case, we anticipate self-implementing a rate increase on January 1, 2010 with an MPSC order expected no later than June 2010. We look forward to working through the elements of the filing with the MPSC, staff and other stakeholders.
