Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan Amendment
On December 2, 2009, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the DTE Energy Company ("Company") Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the DTE Energy Company Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2005) (the "ESRP"). The ESRP provides additional retirement benefits to Company executives beyond the benefits provided by the Company's qualified retirement plan. Under the terms of the amendment, an executive participant's benefits accrued after December 31, 2009 under the ESRP would be forfeited if the executive violates any covenant pursuant to the Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement or the Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement between the Company and the executive participants expected to be entered into in 2010. The amendment to the ESRP is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.

Exhibit 10.1
A. DTE Energy Company (the "Company") adopted the DTE Energy Company Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2005) (the "Plan") to enable the Company to attract and retain executives.
B. The Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Plan.
C. By a resolution properly adopted on December 2, 2009, the Committee amended the Plan to provide for forfeiture of unpaid Plan benefits upon a participant's violation of certain covenants.
Effective December 2, 2009, the DTE Energy Company Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2005) is amended by adding new Section 7.04 as follows:
7.04 .
Forfeiture for Violation of Covenants
(a) This Section 7.04 supersedes any conflicting provision of the Plan.
(b) This Section 7.04 applies to Compensation Credits and Discretionary Contributions, and related earnings and losses, credited to a Participant's Account as of any date after December 31, 2009.
(c) This Section 7.04 applies to the portion of a Frozen MSBP Participant's MSBP benefit or a Grandfathered MSBP Participant's MSBP benefit (as computed under Section 5.01) in excess of the Participant's MSBP benefit computed as if the Participant voluntarily terminated employment on December 31, 2009.
(d) Any amounts described in Section 7.04(b) or 7.04(c) that have not been distributed at the time a Participant or former Participant violates any covenant imposed on the Participant or former Participant under a Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement or a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement (as determined under the Agreement's terms) are immediately forfeited. For purposes of this Section 7.04(d), any annual installments or annuity payments that have not been paid to a Participant or former Participant are treated as not distributed and as forfeitable even if the Participant or former Participant has already received one or more annual installments or annuity payments at the time the Participant or former Participant violates a covenant described in this Section 7.04(d). The Participant or former Participant is required to repay to the Plan any amounts paid to the Participant or former Participant after the time the Participant or former Participant violated a covenant described in this Section 7.04(d).
 
DTE Energy Company has caused this First Amendment to be executed on the 2 day of December, 2009.
