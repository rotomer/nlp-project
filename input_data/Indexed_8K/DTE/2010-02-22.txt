Exhibit 99.1
Feb. 22, 2010
DTE Energy 2009 earnings solid despite economy
~ Cost control a key driver of utilities' performance
~ Company provides 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.75 per share
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported 2009 earnings of $532 million, or $3.24 per diluted share, compared with $546 million, or $3.34 per diluted share in 2008. Reported earnings in 2008 included $0.50 per diluted share related to the sale of a portion of the company's Barnett Shale natural gas property.
2009 operating earnings were $543 million, or $3.30 per diluted share, compared with 2008 operating earnings of $471 million, or $2.89 per diluted share. Operating earnings exclude certain non-recurring items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported to operating earnings for both the quarter ended and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2009 and 2008, are at the end of this news release.
"I'm proud to report that our employees all pulled together during the recession this past year to not only produce solid earnings results, but also sharply improve our operational and reliability metrics," said Anthony F. Earley Jr., DTE Energy chairman and CEO. "However, while our continuous improvement program and one-time cost savings helped to preserve our financial health, neither of our utilities earned their authorized return. Our non-utility businesses also overcame the weak economy to deliver solid earnings and maintain their growth momentum.
"Our 2009 performance enables DTE Energy to continue to be a leader in Michigan's economic rebound. During 2010 our focus on continuous improvement will allow us to efficiently invest capital to meet renewable and environmental regulations. These investments will be a catalyst for bringing new jobs to Michigan while ensuring clean, reliable and affordable energy for our customers."
For the fourth quarter of 2009, DTE Energy had reported earnings of $120 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $129 million, or $0.79 per diluted share in 2008. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2009 were $120 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with $142 million, or $0.87 per diluted share in 2008. The operating earnings per share reduction is primarily a result of lower sales volumes at Detroit Edison due to economy and weather coupled with the timing of maintenance activities and higher benefit expenses.
Operating earnings for 2009, by segment:
Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $2.30 per diluted share versus $2.03 in 2008. The increase in operating earnings was driven by rate increases and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost reductions, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to a weaker economy, cooler weather and higher benefit expenses.
Electric Utility:
MichCon had operating earnings of $0.49 per diluted share compared with $0.55 per diluted share in 2008. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to higher gas theft and customer conservation, partially offset by lower O&M.
Gas Utility:
(Name changed from Gas Midstream) Operating earnings were $0.30 per diluted share compared with 2008 operating earnings of $0.23 per diluted share. The increase in earnings is due to increased storage capacity and higher storage rates as well as Millennium pipeline being placed in service in December 2008.
Gas Storage and Pipelines:
 
This segment had an operating loss of $0.05 per diluted share compared with operating earnings of $0.05 in 2008. Lower natural gas prices primarily drove the earnings loss in 2009.
Unconventional Gas Production:
Power and Industrial Projects operating earnings were $0.22 per diluted share versus 2008 operating earnings of $0.26 per diluted share primarily due to lower coke sales resulting from the downturn in the steel industry in the first half of 2009.
Power and Industrial Projects:
Operating earnings for this segment were $0.46 per diluted share in 2009 compared with $0.27 per diluted share in 2008. The primary driver of this increase in earnings was higher realized gains in gas trading in 2009.
Energy Trading:
This segment had an operating loss of $0.42 per diluted share versus the operating loss of $0.50 in 2008. The year-over-year variance is driven primarily by one-time tax savings in 2009, partially offset by contributions to the DTE Energy Foundation and a realignment of employee benefit costs from MichCon to Corporate and Other.
Corporate and Other:
2010 Guidance
DTE Energy announced 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.75 per diluted share.
"Thanks to the success we had last year in strengthening our balance sheet metrics, DTE Energy enters 2010 on very solid footing with the financial flexibility to fund future growth," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We are focused on using our strong continuous improvement capabilities to further improve our operations and sharply step-up our customer satisfaction.
"We continue to target long-term average annual operating EPS growth of 5 percent to 6 percent while providing an attractive dividend to shareholders."

Use of Operating Earnings Information  In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2010 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2010 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2010 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items.

Many factors may impact forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, the following: the length and severity of ongoing economic decline resulting in lower demand, customer conservation and increased thefts of electricity and gas; changes in the economic and financial viability of our customers, suppliers, and trading counterparties, and the continued ability of such parties to perform their obligations to the Company; economic climate and population growth or decline in the geographic areas where we do business; high levels of uncollectible accounts receivable; access to capital markets and capital market conditions and the results of other financing efforts which can be affected by credit agency ratings; instability in capital markets which could impact availability of short and long-term financing; the timing and extent of changes in interest rates; the level of borrowings; potential for losses on investments, including nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan assets and the related increases in future expense and contributions; the potential for increased costs or delays in completion of significant construction projects; the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on operations and sales to customers, and purchases from suppliers; environmental issues, laws, regulations, and the increasing costs of remediation and compliance, including actual and potential new federal and state requirements that include or could include carbon and more stringent mercury emission controls, a renewable portfolio standard, energy efficiency mandates, a carbon tax or cap and trade structure and ash landfill regulations; nuclear regulations and operations associated with nuclear facilities; impact of electric and gas utility restructuring in Michigan, including legislative amendments and Customer Choice programs; employee relations and the impact of collective bargaining agreements; unplanned outages; changes in the cost and availability of coal and other raw materials, purchased power and natural gas; volatility in the short-term natural gas storage markets impacting third-party storage revenues; cost reduction efforts and the maximization of plant and distribution system performance; the effects of competition; the uncertainties of successful exploration of gas shale resources and challenges in estimating gas reserves with certainty; impact of regulation by the FERC, MPSC, NRC and other applicable governmental proceedings and regulations, including any associated impact on rate structures; changes in and application of federal, state and local tax laws and their interpretations, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, rulings, court proceedings and audits; the amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of regulatory proceedings, related appeals or new legislation; the cost of protecting assets against, or damage due to, terrorism or cyber attacks; the availability, cost, coverage and terms of insurance and stability of insurance providers; changes in and application of accounting standards and financial reporting regulations; changes in federal or state laws and their interpretation with respect to regulation, energy policy and other business issues; and binding arbitration, litigation and related appeals.
