Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
Anthony F. Earley, Jr., DTE Energy Company ("DTE Energy") Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David E. Meador, DTE Energy Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, and Lisa A. Muschong, DTE Energy Director of Investor Relations, will give a business presentation to several groups of investors in Japan from April 14-16, 2010. DTE Energy will begin distributing the applicable slide presentation for those meetings to investors beginning on April 9, 2010. In the presentation and at those meetings, DTE Energy will reiterate its 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.35 to $3.75 per share. A copy of the slide presentation is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of the slide presentation is available at DTE Energy's website, www.dteenergy.com.
In its business presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2010 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2010 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2010 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.
