Exhibit 99.1
Summary of MichCon's Rate Order (U-15985)
1
June 4, 2010
On June 3, 2010, the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued an order in MichCon's rate case. The full text of the order is on the MPSC's website at: http://www.dleg.state.mi.us/mpsc/orders/gas/2010/u-15985_06-03-2010.pdf
The MPSC order authorizes MichCon to raise its rates by approximately $119 million with an 11% authorized return on equity and a 50.4% equity capital structure. The rate order includes a $22 million impact of lower depreciation rates ordered in case U-15699 which adjusted MichCon's as-filed revenue deficiency from $193 million to $171 million. In addition, the MPSC ordered MichCon to implement a pilot revenue decoupling mechanism (RDM) and the continuation of its uncollectible expense tracking mechanism with modifications.
MichCon self-implemented a $170 million rate increase in January 2010; therefore, this final order does not result in an additional increase to customer rates. MichCon is required to refund to customers, with interest, the difference between the authorized rate increase and revenue actually collected from customers via the self-implementation surcharge. The final refund amount will not be known until MichCon has determined the amount collected during the self-implementation period, based on final gas sales volumes. The refund should not be impacted by the reduction in depreciation from case U-15699 given the timing of that case's order and the effective date of the new depreciation rates with this order. MichCon recorded a refund liability of $9 million during Q1 2010 for this potential refund and will review and assess whether an update to the reserve is appropriate for the second quarter.
