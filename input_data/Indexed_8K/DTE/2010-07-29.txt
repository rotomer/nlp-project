July 29, 2010
DTE Energy reports second quarter 2010 results, announces dividend increase
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported second quarter 2010 earnings of $86 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with $83 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009. The DTE Energy Board of Directors also declared a $0.56 per share dividend on its common stock payable Oct. 15, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Sept. 20, 2010. This is a $0.03 per share quarterly increase from the previous dividend payout of $0.53 per share.
"I am pleased that our ongoing dedication to cost containment and customer service continues to deliver strong performance," said Anthony F. Earley Jr., DTE Energy chairman and CEO. "This is despite the fact that our region lags behind the rest of the nation in job growth and economic recovery, which results in significant financial challenges for many of our customers.
"The modest economic recovery, coupled with our multi-year plan to invest in renewable energy, utility infrastructure and environmental controls will create new jobs in our region and provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers," Earley added. "Given these trends, we are pleased to be able to increase our dividend for the first time in three years."
Operating earnings for the second quarter 2010 were $66 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with second quarter 2009 operating earnings of $92 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to economic performance and accounting timing at the energy trading segment. Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items, certain timing-related items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported earnings to operating earnings are at the end of this news release.
Reported earnings for the first six months ended June 30, 2010 were $315 million or $1.88 per diluted share versus $261 million or $1.59 per diluted share in 2009. Year-to-date operating earnings were $295 million or $1.76 per diluted share, compared with $270 million or $1.65 per diluted share in 2009.
Second quarter 2010 operating earnings results, by segment:
Utilities
Operating earnings for Detroit Edison were $0.51 per diluted share versus $0.50 in 2009. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the January 2010 rate order partially offset by a 2009 property tax settlement and other one-time cost reductions in 2009.
Electric Utility:
MichCon had a seasonal operating loss of $0.01 per diluted share, compared with an operating loss of $0.09 per diluted share in 2009. Increased earnings resulting from a June 2010 rate order were partially offset by warmer weather.
Gas Utility:
Non-Utilities
Operating earnings were $0.06 per diluted share, equivalent to second quarter 2009 results.
Gas Storage and Pipelines:
This segment had an operating loss of $0.01 per diluted share, equivalent to second quarter 2009 results.
Unconventional Gas Production:
 
This segment reported operating earnings of $0.13 per diluted share, an improvement over the second quarter 2009 operating loss of $0.01 per diluted share. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by higher coke sales and new projects.
Power and Industrial Projects:
Energy Trading had an operating loss of $0.15 per diluted share versus operating earnings of $0.16 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. The earnings decrease is primarily due to economic performance and accounting timing.
Energy Trading:
The Corporate and Other segment had an operating loss of $0.14 per diluted share compared with the loss of $0.05 in the second quarter of 2009. Reductions in earnings were driven primarily by one-time tax related items in 2009.
Corporate and Other:
Outlook for 2010
DTE Energy reiterated its 2010 operating earnings guidance of $3.45 to $3.80 per diluted share.
"DTE Energy is striving to be distinctive in the utility industry for operational excellence and customer service," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and CFO. "We remain focused on building a culture of engaged employees dedicated to the principles of continuous improvement. This will allow us to enhance the strengths of our businesses and ensure reliable and affordable energy for our customers, while also delivering targeted long-term annual growth of 5 percent to 6 percent and an attractive dividend to our investors."

Use of Operating Earnings Information  DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the board of directors.
In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2010 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2010 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2010 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.

Summary of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company's Rate Case Filing U-16400
1
July 29, 2010
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon) filed a general rate case on July 27, 2010 with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). This document provides a summary of MichCon's filing. The full testimony of the filing will be available on the MPSC's website (http://efile.mpsc.cis.state.mi.us/efile/) under case number U-16400.
The average residential customer annual bill in 2011, including the requested rate increase, is expected to be approximately 6% below what customers paid in 2010. Customers are benefiting from an expected reduction in the cost of natural gas.
Consistent with Michigan's Public Act 286 of 2008, a final MPSC order is expected no later than July 2011. We look forward to working through the elements of the filing with the MPSC, staff and other stakeholders.
