Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On August 27- September 1, 2010 DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Anthony F. Earley, Jr., Vice President, Controller & Investor Relations Peter B. Oleksiak and Director of Investor Relations Mark C. Rolling will meet with groups of investors in Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kohler, WI. A copy of the presentation that will be used at those meetings is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and will be available on DTE Energys website, www.dteenergy.com. In those meetings and in that presentation, DTE Energy reaffirms its 2010 operating earnings per share guidance of $3.45-$3.80 per share.
In its business presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2010 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the companys 2010 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2010 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.
