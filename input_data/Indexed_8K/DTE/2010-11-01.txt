Khouri, Vice President, Controller and Investor Relations Peter B. Oleksiak and Director, Investor Relations Mark C. Rolling will meet with groups of investors at the EEI Financial Conference in Palm Desert, California on November 1-2, 2010. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Meador will provide a business update to the EEI Financial Conference at approximately 8:15 a.m. PDT November 2, 2010. A copy of the slide presentation from the meetings and the business update presentation is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and will be available on DTE Energy's website, www.dteenergy.com. The business update presentation will be available via live webcast and archived for future viewing through a link on DTE Energy's website, www.dteenergy.com. In the meetings and the presentation, DTE Energy reaffirms its 2010 operating earnings per share guidance of $3.50$3.70 per share and provides an early outlook for its 2011 operating earnings per share guidance of $3.40$3.80 per share.
In its business presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2010 and 2011 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2010 and 2011 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2010 and 2011 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
