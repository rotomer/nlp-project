Exhibit 99.1
Summary of Notice of Withdrawal of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company's Rate Case Filing U-16400
1
December 6, 2010
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon) filed a general rate case filing (case number U-16400) on July 27, 2010 with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) requesting a rate increase of $51 million. On December 6, 2010, MichCon filed a notice of withdrawal with the MPSC with respect to this rate case, which the Company expects will be acknowledged in an order from the MPSC by mid-December 2010.
MichCon has determined that, as a result of cost reductions from continuous improvement efforts and other factors, the requested rate increase is no longer necessary in order for MichCon to be able to meet its 2011 operating earnings early outlook.
In 2011, we expect the average residential customer annual bill to be approximately 7% lower than in 2010, with customers benefiting from a reduction in the cost of natural gas.
