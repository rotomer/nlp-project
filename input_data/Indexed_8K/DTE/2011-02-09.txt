Exhibit 99.1
Feb. 9, 2011
DTE Energy reports solid 2010 earnings ~ Company provides 2011 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per share
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported 2010 earnings of $630 million, or $3.74 per diluted share, compared with $532 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2009.
2010 operating earnings were $607 million, or $3.60 per diluted share, compared with 2009 operating earnings of $543 million, or $3.30 per diluted share. Operating earnings exclude certain non-recurring items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported to operating earnings for both the quarter ended and 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2010 and 2009, are at the end of this news release.
The increase in operating earnings at DTE Energy was driven by higher operating earnings at Detroit Edison, MichCon and Power and Industrial Projects, partially offset by lower operating earnings at Energy Trading. As a signal of Michigan's improving economy, Detroit Edison's temperature-normal electric sales increased 3 percent overall, including a 21 percent increase in sales to industrial customers.
"I'm pleased with our solid results in 2010," said Gerard M. Anderson, DTE Energy president and CEO. "We were able to achieve our financial goals by maintaining an intense focus on controlling costs and improving operating performance. DTE Energy operates in a region that is gaining momentum toward an economic recovery. We will contribute to this momentum by doing everything we can to keep energy affordable for our customers.
"As we plan for 2011 and beyond, we want DTE Energy to be a force for growth, investment and renewed prosperity for Michigan," Anderson added. "We will continue to execute on our multi-year plan to invest in renewable energy, environmental controls and utility infrastructure. These investments will be a catalyst for bringing new jobs to Michigan while ensuring clean, reliable and affordable energy for our customers."
2011 Guidance
DTE Energy announced 2011 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per diluted share.
"Solid earnings and cash flow combined with a strong balance sheet allowed us to increase our dividend and secure an upgrade to DTE Energy's credit rating from S&P in 2010," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "In many areas of the company we achieved top quartile performance in terms of operating and cost metrics.
"In 2011, our continuous improvement efforts will allow us to go beyond top quartile performance," Meador added. "This will be key as we focus on achieving our long-term goal of 5 percent to 6 percent annual operating EPS growth while providing an attractive dividend to shareholders."
