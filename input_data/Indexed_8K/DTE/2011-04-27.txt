Exhibit 99.1
April 27, 2011
DTE Energy reports first quarter 2011 results
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported first quarter 2011 earnings of $176 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared with $229 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010.
Operating earnings for the first quarter 2011 were $188 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with first quarter 2010 operating earnings of $229 million, or $1.38 per diluted share. Operating earnings exclude certain non-recurring items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported to operating earnings are at the end of this news release.
The decrease in operating earnings at DTE Energy was driven by lower operating earnings at Energy Trading, Power and Industrial Projects, and Corporate and Other, partially offset by higher operating earnings at Detroit Edison and MichCon.
"I'm pleased we have made a solid start towards achieving our 2011 goals," said Gerard M. Anderson, DTE Energy president and CEO. "I'm also excited about the progress we are making in our campaign to achieve operational excellence that is distinctive in our industry. Our widespread continuous improvement initiative is increasing employee engagement around improving our customers' experience with DTE Energy. It is also helping us to continue identifying cost reduction opportunities that keep our services affordable."
Outlook for 2011
DTE Energy reiterated its 2011 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per diluted share.
"Overall our businesses performed well in the first quarter, and we are on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2011," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Michigan's manufacturing sector continues to recover from the economic downturn and we're seeing early signs of local job growth. DTE Energy is excited to play a key role in helping our region get back on its feet."

Use of Operating Earnings Information  DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the board of directors.
In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2011 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2011 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2011 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items.
