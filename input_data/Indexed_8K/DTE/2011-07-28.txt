Exhibit 99.1
July 28, 2011
DTE Energy reports second quarter 2011 results
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported second quarter 2011 earnings of $202 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, compared with $86 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010. Reported earnings in the second quarter of 2011 include an $88 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, adjustment to reduce income tax expense. This non-cash income tax benefit is the result of the enactment of the Michigan Corporate Income Tax in May of 2011 and the related remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at our non-utility businesses.
Operating earnings for the second quarter 2011 were $111 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with second quarter 2010 operating earnings of $66 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. Operating earnings increased primarily due to solid results at Energy Trading and Detroit Edison, partially offset by lower earnings at Power & Industrial Projects. Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported earnings to operating earnings are at the end of this news release.
"I am pleased with our second quarter performance, which keeps us on track toward achieving our 2011 goals," said Gerard M. Anderson, DTE Energy president and CEO. "I'm also proud of the efforts of our employees in improving customer service and improving our operations. I am confident that our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will enhance our customers' experience with DTE Energy, while providing them with safe, reliable and affordable energy."
Reported earnings for the first six months ended June 30, 2011 were $378 million or $2.23 per diluted share versus $315 million or $1.88 per diluted share in 2010. Year-to-date operating earnings were $299 million or $1.76 per diluted share, compared with $295 million or $1.76 per diluted share in 2010.
Outlook for 2011
DTE Energy reiterated its 2011 operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per diluted share.
"Our solid performance in the second quarter positions us to realize our financial and operational goals for 2011," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "As we execute our multi-year plan to invest in renewable energy, environmental controls and operational maintenance, we remain committed to being a force for growth and renewed prosperity in the communities we serve. We plan to boost annual Michigan-based purchases of products and services by $250 million by 2015," continued Meador. "Approximately 60 percent of our non-fuel purchases will be sourced in Michigan, up from about 44 percent today."

Use of Operating Earnings Information  DTE Energy management believes that operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's earnings from ongoing operations and uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, DTE Energy uses operating earnings to measure performance against budget and to report to the Board of Directors.
In this release, DTE Energy discusses 2011 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2011 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2011 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
The information contained herein is as of the date of this release. DTE Energy expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of new information or future events or developments. Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "projected" and "goals" signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties. This release contains forward-looking statements about DTE Energy's financial results and estimates of future prospects, and actual results may differ materially.
Many factors may impact forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, the following: economic conditions and population changes in our geographic area resulting in changes in demand, customer conservation, increased thefts of electricity and gas and high levels of uncollectible accounts receivable; changes in the economic and financial viability of suppliers and trading counterparties, and the continued ability of such parties to perform their obligations to the Company; access to capital markets and the results of other financing efforts which can be affected by credit agency ratings; instability in capital markets which could impact availability of short and long-term financing; the timing and extent of changes in interest rates; the level of borrowings; the potential for losses on investments, including nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan assets and the related increases in future expense and contributions; the potential for increased costs or delays in completion of significant construction projects; the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on operations and sales to customers, and purchases from suppliers; environmental issues, laws, regulations, and the increasing costs of remediation and compliance, including actual and potential new federal and state requirements; health, safety, financial, environmental and regulatory risks associated with ownership and operation of nuclear facilities; impact of electric and gas utility restructuring in Michigan, including legislative amendments and Customer Choice programs; employee relations and the impact of collective bargaining agreements; unplanned outages; changes in the cost and availability of coal and other raw materials, purchased power and natural gas; volatility in the short-term natural gas storage markets impacting third-party storage revenues; cost reduction efforts and the maximization of plant and distribution system performance; the effects of competition; the uncertainties of successful exploration of unconventional gas resources and challenges in estimating gas and oil reserves with certainty; impact of regulation by the FERC, MPSC, NRC and other applicable governmental proceedings and regulations, including any associated impact on rate structures; changes in and application of federal, state and local tax laws and their interpretations, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, rulings, court proceedings and audits; the amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of regulatory proceedings, related appeals or new legislation; the cost of protecting assets against, or damage due to, terrorism or cyber attacks; the availability, cost, coverage and terms of insurance and stability of insurance providers; changes in and application of accounting standards and financial reporting regulations; changes in federal or state laws and their interpretation with respect to regulation, energy policy and other business issues; binding arbitration, litigation and related appeals; and risks discussed in public filings with the SEC. New factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict what factors may arise or how such factors may cause our results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statements refer only as of the date on which such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
