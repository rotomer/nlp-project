On September 6, 2011, DTE Energy Company ("DTE Energy") will meet with investors and provide a business update at the Barclays Capital CEO Energy-Power Conference in New York City at 4:25 p.m. EDT. DTE Energy also will meet with investors in New York City on September 7, 2011. The presentation is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and will be posted on the DTE Energy website at www.dteenergy.com September 2, 2011. The conference audio will be available via webcast through a link on DTE Energy's website at www.dteenergy.com. The webcast replay will be available and archived on the website. In those meetings and in the presentation, DTE Energy reaffirms its 2011 operating earnings per share guidance of $3.40-$3.70 per share.
In its slide presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2011 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2011 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2011 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items. These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.
