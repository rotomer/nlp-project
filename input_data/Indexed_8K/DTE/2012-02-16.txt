Exhibit 99.1
February 16, 2012
DTE Energy reports solid 2011 results
~ Company provides 2012 operating earnings guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per share
DETROIT  DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) today reported 2011 earnings of $711 million, or $4.18 per diluted share, compared with $630 million, or $3.74 per diluted share in 2010. Reported earnings in 2011 include an $87 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, non-cash adjustment to income tax expense related to the enactment of the Michigan Corporate Income Tax in May of 2011.
2011 operating earnings were $633 million, or $3.73 per diluted share, compared with 2010 operating earnings of $607 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. Combined operating earnings at DTE's electric and gas utilities in Michigan grew slightly. Higher earnings at DTE's Energy Trading business were offset by lower earnings at Power & Industrial Projects. Reductions in Corporate & Other costs also contributed to the earnings improvement. Operating earnings exclude non-recurring items and discontinued operations. Reconciliations of reported earnings to operating earnings are at the end of this news release.
Gerard M. Anderson, DTE Energy's chairman, president and CEO said he was proud of the company's 2011 performance and its contribution to Michigan's recovery. "As one of the largest investors in the state of Michigan, DTE Energy is delivering on its commitment to be a force for renewed growth and prosperity in the communities we serve." Anderson said. "As part of our involvement in the Pure Michigan Business Connect Initiative, we pledged to invest $750 million in new business with Michigan-based suppliers over the next five years.
"We got off to a great start on this initiative in 2011, increasing our purchases from Michigan companies by nearly $125 million to approximately $600 million," Anderson added. "Our experience shows that Michigan companies deliver quality products at a competitive price. Doing business with them is a win-win situation; it's good for both our state and DTE Energy."
Outlook for 2012
DTE Energy announced 2012 operating earnings guidance of $3.65 to $3.95 per diluted share.
"I am pleased with our solid financial and operational results in 2011," said David E. Meador, DTE Energy executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We made good progress in our multi-year plan to invest in renewable energy, environmental controls, and system reliability. These investments will benefit our customers by increasing our ability to deliver cleaner, more reliable energy. At the same time, we continue to tightly control our cost structure to help keep energy affordable for our customers."
When highlighting recent investments, Meador noted:

The information contained herein is as of the date of this release. DTE Energy expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of new information or future events or developments. Words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "projected" and "goals" signify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions but rather are subject to various assumptions, risks and uncertainties. This release contains forward-looking statements about DTE Energy's financial results and estimates of future prospects, and actual results may differ materially.
Many factors may impact forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, the following: economic conditions and population changes in our geographic area resulting in changes in demand, customer conservation, increased thefts of electricity and gas and high levels of uncollectible accounts receivable; changes in the economic and financial viability of suppliers and trading counterparties, and the continued ability of such parties to perform their obligations to the Company; access to capital markets and the results of other financing efforts which can be affected by credit agency ratings; instability in capital markets which could impact availability of short and long-term financing; the timing and extent of changes in interest rates; the level of borrowings; the potential for losses on investments, including nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan assets and the related increases in future expense and contributions; impact of regulation by the FERC, MPSC, NRC and other applicable governmental proceedings and regulations, including any associated impact on rate structures; the amount and timing of cost recovery allowed as a result of regulatory proceedings; the potential for increased costs or delays in completion of significant construction projects; the effects of weather and other natural phenomena on operations and sales to customers, and purchases from suppliers; environmental issues, laws, regulations, and the increasing costs of remediation and compliance, including actual and potential new federal and state requirements; health, safety, financial, environmental and regulatory risks associated with ownership and operation of nuclear facilities; impact of electric and gas utility restructuring in Michigan, including legislative amendments and Customer Choice programs; employee relations and the impact of collective bargaining agreements; unplanned outages; changes in the cost and availability of coal and other raw materials, purchased power and natural gas; volatility in the short-term natural gas storage markets impacting third-party storage revenues; cost reduction efforts and the maximization of plant and distribution system performance; the effects of competition; the uncertainties of successful exploration of unconventional gas resources and challenges in estimating gas and oil reserves with certainty; changes in and application of federal, state and local tax laws and their interpretations, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, rulings, court proceedings and audits, related appeals or new legislation; the cost of protecting assets against, or damage due to, terrorism or cyber attacks; the availability, cost, coverage and terms of insurance and stability of insurance providers; changes in and application of accounting standards and financial reporting regulations; changes in federal or state laws and their interpretation with respect to regulation, energy policy and other business issues; binding arbitration, litigation and related appeals; and risks discussed in public filings with the SEC. New factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict what factors may arise or how such factors may cause our results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
