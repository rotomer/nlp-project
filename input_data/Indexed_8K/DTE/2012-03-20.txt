EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company
Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011 and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
1
MANAGEMENT'S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Certain items reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been eliminated at DTE Energy as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
Gross margin
decreased $19 million in 2011 and increased $45 million in 2010. Revenues associated with certain tracking mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Operation and maintenance
expense increased $17 million in
2011
and decreased $38 million in
2010
. The increase in
2011
is primarily due to the 2010 deferral of $32 million of previously expensed CTA restructuring expenses and increased energy optimization expenses of $10 million, partially offset by reduced uncollectible expenses of $13 million, reduced expenses for subsidiaries transferred to an affiliate of $6 million, lower customer service expenses of $5 million, and lower gas operations expenses of $4 million. The decrease in
2010
is primarily due to reduced uncollectible expenses of $35 million and the deferral of $32 million of previously expensed CTA restructuring expenses, partially offset by higher maintenance expenses of $11 million, increased energy optimization expenses of $9 million, higher employee benefit-related expenses of $3 million and contributions of $3 million to the Low Income Energy Efficiency Fund.

Outlook 
We continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence and sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity. We plan to file a base rate case in the second quarter 2012 and expect to self-implement new rates in the fourth quarter 2012 at the beginning of the heating season. Unfavorable economic trends have resulted in a decrease in the number of customers in our service territory, increased customer conservation and continued high levels of theft and uncollectible accounts receivable. The MPSC has provided for an uncollectible expense tracking mechanism which assists in mitigating the impacts of economic conditions in our service territory and a revenue decoupling mechanism that addresses changes in average customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation. These and other tracking mechanisms and surcharges are expected to result in lower earnings volatility in the future. Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as infrastructure improvement capital programs, the outcome of future regulatory proceedings, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs. We expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity, minimize lost and stolen gas, and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position and the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in shareholder's equity and comprehensive income present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Corporate Structure
MichCon is a Michigan corporation organized in 1898. MichCon is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of DTE Energy. MichCon is a public utility subject to regulation by the MPSC and the FERC. MichCon is engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.2 million customers throughout Michigan and the sale of storage and transportation capacity.
References in this report to we, us, our or Company are to MichCon.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require management to use estimates and assumptions that impact reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from the Company's estimates.
Certain prior year balances were reclassified to match the current year's financial statement presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
The Company consolidates all majority owned subsidiaries and investments in entities in which it has controlling influence. Non-majority owned investments are accounted for using the equity method when the Company is able to influence the operating policies of the investee. Non-majority owned investments include investments in limited liability companies, partnerships or joint ventures. When the Company does not influence the operating policies of an investee, the cost method is used. The Company eliminates all intercompany balances and transactions.
The Company evaluates whether an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) whenever reconsideration events occur. The Company consolidates VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is not the primary beneficiary and an ownership interest is held, the VIE is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. When assessing the determination of the primary beneficiary, the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb the expected losses and/or the right to receive the expected returns of the VIE. The Company performs ongoing reassessments of all VIEs to determine if the primary beneficiary status has changed.
NOTE 2
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenues
Revenues from the sale, delivery and storage of natural gas are recognized as services are provided. MichCon records revenues for gas provided but unbilled at the end of each month. Rates for MichCon include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in the cost of natural gas and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.
MichCon has an RDM that is designed to minimize the impact on revenues of changes in average customer usage of natural gas. The June 2010 MPSC order in MichCon's 2009 rate case provided for, among other items, the implementation of a pilot RDM effective July 1, 2010, which enables MichCon to recover or refund the change in revenue resulting from the difference in weather-adjusted average sales per customer compared to the base average sales per customer established in the MPSC order. The pilot RDM program is subject to review in future MPSC proceedings. The RDM addresses changes in customer usage due to general economic conditions and conservation, but does not shield MichCon from the impacts of lost customers or weather variations.
See Note 8 for further discussion of recovery mechanisms authorized by the MPSC.
10
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is the change in Common shareholder's equity during a period from transactions and events from non-owner sources, including net income.
Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and temporary investments purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less.
Receivables
Accounts receivable are primarily composed of trade receivables and unbilled revenue. Our accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is generally calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. The Company establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management's assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in 21 days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action. MichCon assesses late payment fees on trade receivables based on contractual past-due terms with customers. Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted, generally one year after service has been terminated.
Unbilled revenues of $110 million and $157 million are included in customer accounts receivable at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Notes Receivable
Notes receivable, or financing receivables, are primarily comprised of capital lease receivables and loans.
Notes receivable are typically considered delinquent when payment is not received for periods ranging from 60 to 120 days. The Company ceases accruing interest (nonaccrual status), considers a note receivable impaired, and establishes an allowance for credit loss when it is probable that all principal and interest amounts due will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the note receivable. Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal. Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.
In determining the allowance for credit losses for notes receivable, we consider the historical payment experience and other factors that are expected to have a specific impact on the counterparty's ability to pay. In addition, the Company monitors the credit ratings of the counterparties from which we have notes receivable.
Inventories
MichCon generally values materials and supplies at average cost.
Gas inventory of $52 million and $43 million as of December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively, is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. At December 31, 2011, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO cost by $95 million. At December 31, 2010, the replacement cost of gas remaining in storage exceeded the LIFO cost by $147 million.
11
Gas Customer Choice Deferred Asset
Gas customer choice deferred asset represents gas provided to MichCon by suppliers of gas for customers that participate in the Customer Choice program. As the gas is sold and billed to Customer Choice customers, primarily in the December through March heating season, this asset is reduced. At the end of an April through March cycle each year, any balance is reconciled and settled with the various suppliers.
Property, Retirement and Maintenance, and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Property is stated at cost and includes construction-related labor, materials, overheads and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The cost of properties retired, including the cost of removal, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.
Property is depreciated over its estimated useful life using straight-line rates approved by the MPSC.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows generated by the asset, an impairment loss is recognized resulting in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
Excise and Sales Taxes
The Company records the billing of excise and sales taxes as a receivable with an offsetting payable to the applicable taxing authority, with no net impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Deferred Debt Costs
The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the life of each debt issue. In accordance with MPSC regulations, the unamortized discount, premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized over the life of the replacement issue.
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The Company generally classifies investments in debt and equity securities as trading and has recorded such investments at market value with unrealized gains or losses included in earnings.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company received an allocation of costs from DTE Energy associated with stock-based compensation. Our allocation for stock-based compensation expense was approximately $9 million in 2011 and $7 million in 2010 and 2009.
Asset Gains, net
In 2009, MichCon sold certain gathering and processing assets resulting in a gain of $21 million. Additionally, MichCon recognized a gain of $9 million on the sale of base gas in 2009.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 19, 2012, the date that these financial statements were available to be issued.
12
Other Accounting Policies
See the following notes for other accounting policies impacting the Company's consolidated financial statements:
NOTE 3
FAIR VALUE
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants' use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. The Company makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Company and its counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The Company believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
A fair value hierarchy has been established, that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. All assets and liabilities are required to be classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the fair value hierarchy defined as follows:
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of long-term debt is determined by using quoted market prices when available and a discounted cash flow analysis based upon estimated current borrowing rates when quoted market prices are not available. The table below shows the fair value and the carrying value for long-term debt securities. Certain other financial instruments, such as notes payable, customer deposits and notes receivable are not shown as carrying value approximates fair value.
 
13
NOTE 4
FINANCIAL AND OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company recognizes all derivatives at their fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position unless they qualify for certain scope exceptions, including the normal purchases and normal sales exception. Further, derivatives that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified as either hedges of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), or as hedges of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge). For cash flow hedges, the portion of the derivative gain or loss that is effective in offsetting the change in the value of the underlying exposure is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified into earnings when the underlying transaction occurs. For fair value hedges, changes in fair values for the derivative are recognized in earnings each period. Gains and losses from the ineffective portion of any hedge are recognized in earnings immediately. For derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings each period.
 
The Company's primary market risk exposure is associated with commodity prices, credit and interest rates. MichCon has risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks.
 
Commodity Price Risk
The Company has fixed-priced contracts for portions of its expected gas supply requirements through 2014. Substantially all of these contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exception and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method. The Company may also sell forward transportation and storage capacity contracts. Forward transportation and storage contracts are not derivatives and are therefore accounted for under the accrual method.
Credit Risk
The Company is exposed to credit risk if customers or counterparties do not comply with their contractual obligations. MichCon maintains credit policies that significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential customers' and counterparties' financial condition, credit rating, collateral requirements or other credit enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees. The Company generally uses standardized agreements that allow the netting of positive and negative transactions associated with a single counterparty. The Company maintains a provision for credit losses based on factors surrounding the credit risk of its customers, historical trends, and other information. Based on the Company's credit policies and its December 31, 2011 provision for credit losses, the Company's exposure to counterparty nonperformance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk
MichCon occasionally uses treasury locks and other interest rate derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rate market volatility. In 2004, MichCon entered into an interest rate derivative to limit its sensitivity to market interest rate risk associated with the issuance of long-term debt. Such instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. The Company subsequently issued long-term debt and terminated the hedge at a cost that is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to interest expense as the related interest affects earnings through 2033.
14
NOTE 5
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Summary of property by classification as of December 31:
AFUDC capitalized in 2011 was approximately $1 million and no AFUDC was capitalized during 2010.
The composite depreciation rate for MichCon was 2.3% in 2011, 2.5% in 2010, and 3.1% in 2009.
The average estimated useful life for gas distribution and transportation property was 62 years and 61 years, respectively, at December 31, 2011.
Capitalized software costs are classified as Property, plant and equipment and the related amortization is included in Accumulated depreciation and amortization, on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company capitalizes the costs associated with computer software it develops or obtains for use in its business. The Company amortizes capitalized software costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, ranging from 5 to 15 years.
Capitalized software costs amortization expense was $7 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of capitalized software costs at December 31, 2011 were $95 million and $55 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of capitalized software costs at December 31, 2010 were $96 million and $51 million, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software costs is estimated to be $7 million annually for 2012 through 2016.
NOTE 6
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The Company has conditional retirement obligations for gas pipelines, certain service centers, compressor and gate stations. The Company recognizes such obligations as liabilities at fair market value when they are incurred, which generally is at the time the associated assets are placed in service. Fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. The Company defers timing differences that arise in the expense recognition of legal asset retirement costs that are currently recovered in rates.
No liability has been recorded with respect to lead-based paint, as the quantities of lead-based paint in the Company's facilities are unknown. In addition, there is no incremental cost to demolitions of lead-based paint facilities vs. non-lead-based paint facilities and no regulations currently exist requiring any type of special disposal of items containing lead-based paint.
15
A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligation for 2011 follows:
NOTE 7
RESTRUCTURING
Restructuring Costs
In 2005, the Company initiated a company-wide review of its operations called the Performance Excellence Process. In September 2006, the MPSC issued an order approving a settlement agreement that allowed MichCon, commencing in 2006, to defer the incremental CTA. Further, the order provided for MichCon to amortize the CTA deferrals over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the CTA was deferred. The September 2006 order did not provide a regulatory recovery mechanism for MichCon, therefore MichCon expensed CTA incurred during the period 2006 through 2008. The June 2010 MPSC order provided for MichCon's recovery of the regulatory unamortized balance of CTA. At June 30, 2010, MichCon deferred and recognized in income approximately $32 million ($20 million after-tax) of previously expensed CTA. The non-pension component of CTA of approximately $21 million is included in Regulatory assets. The pension component of CTA of approximately $11 million is included in Regulatory liabilities. MichCon amortized approximately $3 million and $2 million of deferred CTA costs in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amounts expensed are recorded in Operation and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred amounts are recorded in Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. See Note 8.
NOTE 8
REGULATORY MATTERS
Regulation
MichCon is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting and operating-related matters. MichCon's MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on our investments. MichCon operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff.
MichCon also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC. The FERC's jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates, non-discriminatory requirements and terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by MichCon in interstate markets. FERC granted MichCon authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at market-based rates. MichCon provides transportation services in interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and filed with the FERC.
We are subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment and health.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
MichCon is required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. Continued applicability of regulatory accounting treatment requires that rates be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and be charged to and collected from customers. Future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses and may require the write-off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery through regulated rates. Management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment.
The following are balances and a brief description of the regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31:
16
As noted below, regulatory assets for which costs have been incurred have been included (or are expected to be included, for costs incurred subsequent to the most recently approved rate case) in MichCon's rate base, thereby providing a return on invested costs. Certain regulatory assets do not result from cash expenditures and therefore do not represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting liabilities that reduce rate base.
ASSETS
17
LIABILITIES
Energy Optimization (EO) Plans
In April 2011, MichCon filed an application for approval of its reconciliation of 2010 EO plan expenses. MichCon's EO reconciliation includes a cumulative $5.6 million net over-recovery at year end 2010 for the 2010 EO plan. In November 2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement which authorized the over-recovery balances be included in the 2011 reconciliations.
  
In September 2011, MichCon filed a biennial EO Plan with the MPSC as required. MichCon's EO Plan application proposed the recovery of EO expenditures for the period 2012-2015 of $103 million and further requested approval of surcharges to
18
recover these costs.
MichCon UETM
In March 2011, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for approval of its UETM for 2010 requesting recovery of approximately $31 million
,
consisting of $7 million related to 2010 uncollectible expense and $24 million related to the 2008 UETM under-collection. In September 2011, the MPSC approved a settlement agreement approving the 2010 UETM and the implementation of a surcharge beginning October 1, 2011.
MichCon Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM)
In September 2011, MichCon filed an application with the MPSC for approval of its RDM reconciliation for the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. MichCon's RDM application proposed the recovery of approximately $20 million.
Low Income Energy Efficiency Fund
The Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act of 2000 authorized the creation of the LIEEF administered by the MPSC. The purpose of the fund is to provide shut-off and other protection for low income customers and to promote energy efficiency by all customer classes. MichCon collects funding for the LIEEF as part of its base rates and remits the funds to the State of Michigan monthly. In July 2011, the Michigan Court of Appeals issued a decision reversing the portion of MichCon's June 2010 MPSC rate order that permitted MichCon to recover funding for the LIEEF in base rates. In response to the Court of Appeals decision, MichCon ceased remitting payments for LIEEF funding to the State of Michigan. In October 2011, the MPSC issued an order directing MichCon to continue collecting funds for LIEEF in rates and to escrow the collected funds pending further order by the MPSC. On January 26, 2012, the MPSC issued an order directing MichCon to file a comprehensive plan by March 1, 2012 for refunding previously escrowed LIEEF funds of $3 million. On December 20, 2011, The Vulnerable Household Warmth Fund (VHWF) was created under Michigan law. The purpose of the fund is to provide payment or partial payment of bills for electricity, natural gas, propane, heating oil, or any other type of fuel used to heat the primary residence of a vulnerable customer during the 2011-2012 heating season. Effective with the new law, MichCon is to contribute the amounts collected in its base rates, previously remitted for the LIEEF, to the new VHWF. The monthly payments into the VHWF will cease on the earlier of September 30, 2012 or when $48 million has been accumulated in the fund from payments by major Michigan electric and gas utilities.
Gas Cost Recovery Proceedings
The GCR process is designed to allow MichCon to recover all of its gas supply costs if incurred under reasonable and prudent policies and practices. The MPSC reviews these costs, policies and practices for prudence in annual plan and reconciliation filings.
2009-2010 GCR Year
 - An MPSC order was issued on December 6, 2011 for the GCR reconciliation for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2010 disallowing recovery of $3.3 million related to the pricing of certain gas purchases from an affiliate. The MPSC also authorized MichCon to include in its 2010-2011 GCR reconciliation beginning balance the net overrecovery of approximately $9 million. On January 5, 2012, MichCon filed a petition for rehearing related to the $3.3 million disallowance.
2010-2011 Plan Year
 - In June 2011, MichCon filed its 2010-2011 GCR plan year reconciliation case calculating a net over-recovery of $1 million, including interest. This over-recovery does not reflect the December 6, 2011 MPSC order on the 2009-2010 plan year reconciliation case.
2011-2012 Plan Year
 - In December 2010, MichCon filed its GCR plan case for the 2011-2012 GCR plan year. MichCon filed for a maximum base GCR factor of $5.89 per Mcf adjustable monthly by a contingency factor.
2012-2013 Plan Year
 - In December 2011, MichCon filed its GCR plan case for the 2012-2013 GCR plan year. MichCon filed for a maximum base GCR factor of $5.18 per Mcf adjustable monthly by a contingency factor.
Gas Main Renewal and Gas Meter Move Out Programs
The June 3, 2010 MPSC gas rate case order required MichCon to make filings related to gas main renewal and meter move-out programs. In a July 30, 2010 filing, MichCon proposed to implement a 10-year gas main renewal program beginning in 2012 which would require capital expenditures of approximately $17 million per year for renewing gas distribution mains, retiring gas mains, and where appropriate and when related to the gas main renewal or retirement activity, relocate inside meters to

outside locations and renew service lines. In a September 30, 2010 filing, MichCon proposed to implement a 10-year gas meter move out program beginning in 2012 which would require capital expenditures of approximately $22 million per year primarily for relocation of inside meters to the outside of residents' houses. In September 2011, the MPSC issued orders approving both programs and requested MichCon to include the recovery of costs associated with these two programs in future MichCon rate cases.

The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the unresolved regulatory matters discussed herein. Resolution of these matters is dependent upon future MPSC orders and appeals, which may materially impact the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

INCOME TAXES
Income Tax Summary
MichCon is part of the consolidated federal income tax return of DTE Energy. Our federal income tax expense is determined on an individual company basis with no allocation of tax benefits or expenses from other affiliates of DTE Energy. MichCon had an income tax receivable of $42 million at December 31, 2011 and $48 million at December 31, 2010 due from DTE Energy.
Total income tax expense varied from the statutory federal income tax rate for the following reasons:
Components of income tax expense (benefit) were as follows:
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and the reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent according to the classification of the related assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to assets or liabilities are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary differences. Consistent with rate making treatment, deferred taxes are offset in the table below for temporary differences which have related regulatory assets and liabilities.
Deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of the following at December 31:
20
The above table excludes unamortized investment tax credits of $8 million and $9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property.
Uncertain Tax Positions
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, if recognized, would not have a significant impact on our effective rate.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties pertaining to income taxes in Interest expense and Other expenses, respectively, on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had insignificant amounts of accrued interest at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The Company had no accrued penalties pertaining to income taxes. We had an insignificant interest benefit in relation to income tax for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $1 million interest benefit in relation to income tax for the years ended December 31, 2010.
In 2010, DTE Energy and its subsidiaries settled a federal tax audit for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, which resulted in the recognition of $9 million of unrecognized tax benefits by MichCon. The Company's federal income tax returns for 2009 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the IRS. The Company's Michigan Business Tax returns for 2008 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the State of Michigan.
Michigan Corporate Income Tax (MCIT)
On May 25, 2011, the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) was repealed and the MCIT was enacted and became effective January 1, 2012. The MCIT subjects corporations with business activity in Michigan to a 6 percent tax rate on an apportioned income tax base and eliminates the modified gross receipts tax and nearly all credits available under the MBT. The MCIT also eliminated the future deductions allowed under MBT that enabled companies to establish a one-time deferred tax asset upon enactment of the MBT to offset deferred tax liabilities that resulted from enactment of the MBT.
As a result of the enactment of the MCIT, the net state deferred tax liability was remeasured to reflect the impact of the MCIT tax rate on cumulative temporary differences expected to reverse after the effective date. The net impact of this remeasurement was a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities of $6 million that was offset against the regulatory asset established upon the enactment of the MBT. Due to the elimination of the future tax deductions allowed under the MBT, the one-time MBT deferred tax asset that was established upon the enactment of the MBT has been remeasured to zero. The net impact of this
21
remeasurement is a reduction of net deferred tax assets of $53 million that was offset against the Regulatory liability established upon enactment of the MBT.
Consistent with the original establishment of this deferred tax liability, no recognition of this non-cash transaction has been reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
NOTE 10
LONG-TERM DEBT AND PREFERRED SECURITIES
Long-Term Debt
Our long-term debt outstanding and interest rates of debt outstanding at December 31 were:
The following table shows the scheduled debt maturities, excluding any unamortized discount or premium on debt:
Cross Default Provisions
Substantially all of the net properties of MichCon are subject to the lien of its mortgage. Should MichCon fail to timely pay its indebtedness under the mortgage, such failure may create cross defaults in the indebtedness of DTE Energy.
Preferred and Preference Securities - Authorized and Unissued
At December 31, 2011, MichCon had 7 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $1 per share and 4 million shares of preference stock with a par value of $1 per share authorized, with no shares issued.
NOTE 11
SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS
In October 2011, MichCon entered into an amended and restated $400 million five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 20 banks that may be used for general corporate borrowings, but is intended to provide liquidity support for the Company's commercial paper program. No one bank provides more than 8.5% of the commitment in any facility. Borrowings under the facility are available at prevailing short-term interest rates.
The above agreements require the Company to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 0.65 to 1. In the agreements, total funded debt means all indebtedness of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including capital
22
lease obligations, hedge agreements and guarantees of third parties debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain MichCon short-term debt. Capitalization means the sum of (a) total funded debt plus (b) consolidated net worth, which is equal to consolidated total stockholders equity of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (excluding pension effects under certain FASB statements), as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At December 31, 2011, the total funded debt to total capitalization ratio for MichCon is 0.45 to 1 and is in compliance with this financial covenant. Should MichCon have delinquent obligations of at least $50 million to any creditor, such delinquency will be considered a default under its credit agreement.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding commercial paper of $185 million, resulting in net availability under the combined facilities of $215 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding commercial paper of $150 million.
The weighted average interest rates for short-term borrowings were 0.5% and 0.4% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
NOTE 12
OPERATING LEASES
Lessee
- MichCon leases various assets under operating lease arrangements expiring at various dates through 2025. Some leases contain renewal options. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases at December 31, 2011 were:
Rental expense for operating leases was $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Lessor
 -MichCon leases a portion of its pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline through a capital lease contract that expires in 2020, with renewal options extending for five years. DTE Energy owns a 40% interest in the Vector Pipeline. The components of the net investment in the capital lease at December 31, 2011, are as follows:
NOTE 13
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
Contaminated Sites
  Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. MichCon owns, or previously owned, 14 former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. In addition to the MGP sites, the Company is also
23
in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years.
The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. Accordingly, MichCon recognizes a liability and corresponding regulatory asset for estimated investigation and remediation costs at former MGP sites. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had $36 million, accrued for remediation.
Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect the Companys financial position and cash flows. The Company anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC for MichCon, which allows MichCon to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations.
Labor Contracts
There are several bargaining units for the Company's represented employees. The majority of represented employees are under a contract that expires in October 2013.
Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2011, the Company was party to numerous long-term purchase commitments relating to a variety of goods and services required for its business. These agreements primarily consist of long-term gas purchase and transportation agreements. The Company estimates that these commitments will be approximately $1.2 billion through 2051. MichCon also estimates that 2012 capital expenditures will be approximately $215 million. The Company has made certain commitments in connection with expected capital expenditures.
Bankruptcies
The Company purchases and sells gas and gas storage and transportation services from and to governmental entities and numerous companies operating in the steel, automotive, energy, retail and other industries. Certain of its customers have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company regularly reviews contingent matters relating to these customers and its purchase and sale contracts and it records provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss. The Company believes its previously accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The final resolution of these matters may have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Other Contingencies
The Company is involved in certain other legal, regulatory, administrative and environmental proceedings before various courts, arbitration panels and governmental agencies concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings include certain contract disputes, additional environmental reviews and investigations, audits, inquiries from various regulators, and pending judicial matters. The Company cannot predict the final disposition of such proceedings. The Company regularly reviews legal matters and records provisions for claims that it can estimate and are considered probable of loss. The resolution of these pending proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on its operations or financial statements in the periods they are resolved. See Note 8 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory Matters.
NOTE 14
RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TRUSTEED ASSETS
Pension Plan Benefits
MichCon participates in various plans that provide pension and other postretirement benefits for DTE Energy and its affiliates. The plans are sponsored by DTE Energy Corporate Services, LLC (LLC), a subsidiary of DTE Energy. MichCon is allocated net periodic benefit costs (credits) for its share of the amounts of the combined plans.
The Company's policy is to fund pension costs by contributing amounts consistent with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 provisions and additional amounts it deems appropriate. The Company did not make a contribution to its pension plans in 2011. At the discretion of management, and depending on financial market conditions, the Company anticipates making a contribution of $40 million in 2012.
The MPSC approved the deferral of the non-capitalized portion of the Company's negative pension expense. In 2011 and 2010,
24
the Company deferred $8 million and $4 million, respectively, as a regulatory liability.
Net pension cost (credit) includes the following components:
25
The following table reconciles the obligations, assets and funded status of the Company's portion of the pension plans as well as the amounts recognized as prepaid pension cost in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31:
Assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net pension costs are listed below:
The Company employs a formal process in determining the long-term rate of return for various asset classes. Management reviews historic financial market risks and returns and long-term historic relationships between the asset classes of equities, fixed income and other assets, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that asset classes with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-term. Current market factors such as inflation, interest rates, asset class risks
26
and asset class returns are evaluated and considered before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment management and rebalancing. Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. The long-term portfolio return is also established employing a consistent formal process, with due consideration of diversification, active investment and rebalancing. Peer data is reviewed to check for reasonableness. As a result of this process, the Company is lowering its long-term rate of return assumptions for its pension and OPEB plans to 8.25% for 2012. The Company believes this rate is a reasonable assumption for the long-term rate of return on its plan assets for 2012 given its investment strategy.
At December 31, 2011, the benefits related to the Company's qualified and nonqualified pension plans expected to be paid in each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:
The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income and other investments are used to maximize the long-term return on plan assets consistent with prudent levels of risk, with consideration given to the liquidity needs of the plan. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of future plan cash flows, plan funded status, and corporate financial considerations. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income and other investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, growth and value investment styles, and large and small market capitalizations. Fixed income securities generally include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other assets such as private equity and hedge funds are used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be utilized in a risk controlled manner, to potentially increase the portfolio beyond the market value of invested assets and reduce portfolio investment risk. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

The pension trust holds debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and institutional mutual funds. Exchange-traded debt and equity securities held directly are valued using quoted market prices in actively traded markets. The commingled funds and institutional mutual funds which hold exchange-traded equity or debt securities are valued based on underlying securities, using quoted prices in actively traded markets. Non-exchange traded fixed income securities are valued by the trustee based upon quotations available from brokers or pricing services. A primary price source is identified by asset type, class or issue for each security. The trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the trustees challenge an assigned price and determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. The Company has obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, the Company selectively corroborates the fair values of securities by comparison of market-based price sources.

The Company also participates in defined contribution retirement savings plans for DTE Energy and its affiliates. Participation in one of these plans is available to substantially all represented and non-represented employees. The Company matches employee contributions up to certain predefined limits based upon eligible compensation, the employee's contribution rate and, in some cases, years of credited service. The cost of these plans was $4 million in each of the years 2011, 2010, and 2009.
Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company participates in plans sponsored by LLC that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for employees who are eligible for these benefits. The Company's policy is to fund certain trusts to meet our postretirement benefit obligations. Separate qualified Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts exist for represented and non-represented employees. The Company contributed $45 million to the VEBA trusts during 2011. The Company contributed $45 million to the VEBA trusts in January 2012. Net postretirement cost includes the following components:

Assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net benefit cost are listed below:
A one percentage point increase in health care cost trend rates would have increased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by $7 million and increased the accumulated benefit obligation by $55 million at December 31, 2011. A one percentage point decrease in the health care cost trend rates would have decreased the total service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by $6 million and would have decreased the accumulated benefit obligation by $85 million at December 31, 2011.

Healthcare Legislation
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were enacted into law (collectively, the Act). The Act is a comprehensive health care reform bill. A provision of the Act repeals the current rule permitting deduction of the portion of the drug coverage expense that is offset by the Medicare Part D subsidy, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012.
MichCon's retiree healthcare plan includes the provision of postretirement prescription drug coverage (coverage) which is included in the calculation of the recorded other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligation. Because the Company's coverage meets certain criteria, MichCon is eligible to receive the Medicare Part D subsidy. With the enactment of the Act, the subsidy will continue to not be subject to tax, but an equal amount of prescription drug coverage expenditures will not be deductible. Income tax accounting rules require the impact of a change in tax law be recognized in continuing operations in the
34
Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that the tax law change is enacted.
This change in tax law required a remeasurement of the Deferred Tax Asset related to the OPEB obligation and the Deferred Tax Liability related to the OPEB Regulatory Asset in 2010. The net impact of the remeasurement was $3 million and has been deferred as a Regulatory Asset as the traditional rate setting process allows for the recovery of income tax costs.
In December 2003, the Medicare Act was signed into law which provides for a non-taxable federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. The effects of the subsidy reduced net periodic postretirement benefit costs by $1 million in 2011, $2 million in 2010, and $4 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, the gross amount of federal subsidies expected to be received in 2012 is estimated to be $1 million.
Grantor Trust
MichCon maintains a Grantor Trust to fund other postretirement benefit obligations that invests in life insurance contracts and income securities. Employees and retirees have no right, title or interest in the assets of the Grantor Trust, and the Company can revoke the trust subject to providing the MPSC with prior notification. MichCon accounts for its investment at fair value, approximately $13 million at December 31, 2011, with unrealized gains and losses recorded to earnings.
NOTE 15
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
