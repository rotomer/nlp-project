1
August 1, 2012
The Detroit Edison Company (Detroit Edison) filed an application for accounting authority today with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). This document provides a summary of Detroit Edisons filing. The full filing will be available on the MPSCs website (http://efile.mpsc.state.mi.us/efile/) under case number U-17068.
In its filing, Detroit Edison seeks approval to defer for future amortization the gain resulting from the reversal of Detroit Edisons regulatory liability associated with the Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM). It is currently anticipated that with this accounting treatment, along with other cost saving measures, Detroit Edison will not need to increase base rates until 2015.
